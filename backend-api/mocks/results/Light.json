I will, for instance, show you how to build a 30 channel LED TV light, which adapts to the colors of your screen.

It is really easy and if you only have some electronic skills and this is not your first project, it is even easier and you can modify it as you like.So let's get started...\nFirst of all, I want to explain the main principle of the completed unit.\n1. You connect a computer to your TV and to the ambilight unit via USB.\n2. You start the Boblight software\n3. You start a movie.\n4. Boblight analyzes your screen image and calculates some mean values of specific areas of your screen\n5. Boblight sends these color-values via USB to your ambilight unit.\n6. The micro controller within that unit takes the received color-values\n7. According to the values the micro controller changes the LED strip colors\nSteps 4 to 7 will be repeated up to about 50 times / second until you tell Boblight to stop.", "title": "30 Channel LED RGB Ambilight Clone", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/30-channel-LED-RGB-Ambilight-Clone/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I will stay in metric scale, because it is much better than this crappy inch, feet and mile thing. You can convert centimeters to inches by dividing by 2.54, but I guess you know that\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ;-)\nBefore we can start soldering all the stuff together we have to order it. Let's start with the LED strips responsible for the illumination. We need to control the color of the strip. By adjusting only three colors (Red, Green, Blue) it is possible to create many many colors. Your TV works similar. Google for RGB if you want to know more about that. So we will need LED strips which have got 3 channels. One for color red, one for color green and one for color blue. If you power up the red channel, the strip will glow in red, if you power up the red and the blue channel it will be pink or something (mix of blue and red). By adjusting the voltage of the channels it is possible to create all the colors we need.\nThere are so many different RGB LED strips out there: 60 LEDs per meter, 30 LEDs per meter, common anode, common cathode, waterproof, length of 3 meter, length of 5 meter, etc.Common anode or common cathode?\nYou HAVE to take common anode (all 3 channels share 12V) because of the TLC5940 and that is really important. You could destroy the TLC5940 chip if you try to connect it to 12V.Waterproof?\nAs long as your TV isn't waterproof and you don't want to use your new ambilight under water, there is no real necessity to buy waterproof LED strips. It may be better because of insulation issues. You will tape the strips onto the back of your TV so make sure, you either buy waterproof strips, or the back of your screen is not conductive, because otherwise you could get in big trouble as soon as the contacts of the strips short curcuit. My screen backside is not conductive, because it is painted, so I decided to save the money and use non-waterproof strips.60 or 30 LEDs per meter?\nAnother question is, how many LEDs you want per meter. The TLC5940 chip, which will control the color of the strips, is capable of serving 120mA per channel. I would not exceed that value.\nI measured 15 LEDs on one strip. Here are my results: If you power up all three channels completely,\u00a0 the strip takes 240mA and glows completely white. The red channel takes 90mA, green and blue 75mA each. 90mA is close enough to 120mA maximum, and we still have a little buffer of 30mA. So the TLC5940 chip is capable of driving 15 LEDs on one channel without getting too close to the maximum.\nNow back to the question what to buy.\nIf you want to use a strip with 60 LEDs per meter, the maximum length of one strip is 25cm, because than you have exactly 15LEDs. If you decide to buy a strip with 30 LEDs per meter, you can double the length of one strip to half a meter to have 15 LEDs. Shorter strips, of course, are always possible. It's not just a question of current flowing, but of brightness. Maybe your room is often dark and you don't want that many LEDs shining behind your tv. In such a case 30 LEDs per meter would be completely okay and you don't have to pay the extra price for 60 LEDs per meter. To get to the point, I used strips with 60 LEDs per meter, because I ordered them to compare both solutions.\nAfter all of your ordered LED strips arrived, one of the first things you have to do is to cut the LED strips into smaller pieces and solder cables to the ends.Here is my setup:\nI have got a 127cm (50\") TV screen.\nThe outer dimension:\nWidth: 118cm\nHeight: 74cm\nI wanted to have 10 areas all in all so I had to cut the whole long thing (5 meters) into 10 shorter strips. The question was how long shell they be? Just to get an idea, I attached an image so you can see where I taped the strips to the backside of my tv screen after I finished the project. As you can see, one piece has to have the length of 25cm to make sure there is enough light, small distances between two strips and they do not overlap. That corresponds to the results I measured for the maximum current. So at the end I still had 2.5 meters of LED strip left, which was resold on ebay.Power Supply\nAs already precalculated each one of these strips takes 240mA on full white light. If you multiply that value by 10 strips, we get 2.4A.That is pretty much in my opinion: About 30 Watt.\nI ordered my 12V power supply from Ebay. It can serve up to 5A and only costed 9 euros. Now I have a nice security buffer and the device doesn't overheat.Soldering cables to the strips\nMy strips can be cut every 3 LEDs (so 5cm) and there are premade solder joints. Look at the second image I attatched to this step just beside the letters B R G on the strip. Sometimes there is even some solder on it so you don't need to care about that. If not, just take a needle and make a small hole into each of the joints and the solder will hold really good.\nJust solder one cable to each channel and one cable for common anode (12V). Every strip has to have four cables. I used old network cable because it was long enough to cut it into pieces and has got 8 cables in it. That is very good because we need 4 cables per channel and I wanted to make pairs to cut down the number of cables behind my tv. The cable also has got a nice coating so I only have one bigger cable instead of 8 individual ones per pair. Now I have got four pairs of strips and two single (bottom). Make sure your chosen cables are long enough so the controller unit doesn't float behind your screen.\nYou can either leave the other side of the cable as they are and solder them directly to the controller unit or solder some pins to it so the strips are exchangeable, if one gets destroyed. That's up to you.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FV7/0INC/GVUS2M3O/FV70INCGVUS2M3O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F06/Y78B/GVU6OH3T/F06Y78BGVU6OH3T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBB/35IK/GVOX0XKG/FBB35IKGVOX0XKG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F28/LAQK/GVVPBJ1K/F28LAQKGVVPBJ1K.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: LED Strips"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The controller unit consists of two pieces.Microcontroller\nThe micro controller, in my case an arduino duemilanove, receives the color values from your computer via USB (serial). The sketch running on the arduino is only a few lines long. It waits for enough data on the serial stream, reads one synchronization byte and than 30 bytes for the channels' color values.\nThe next step would be to control the colors of the led strips.Problem\nThat is done with a technique called PWM. For those of you who are interested in the technical details, just search for it on wikipedia. One of the problems is, that the arduino only has 6 PWM channels. That would be enough to control 2 strips (RGB x 2 = 6 channels), which is not much. Another problem is that the PWM pins of the arduino are not capable of serving the 'high' currencies we need. So we will expand the number of PWM pins to as many as we want (almost) by adding some TLC5940 chips. Each one of these chips will add 16 PWM pins to your arduino, by giving up a few of the 6 you already have. But that's no problem, because the new pins are better. They have a higher resolution and can serve higher currencies, which is more than a fair deal.\nAs I already explained, I have got 10 LED strips. Each one of these strips has got 3 channels. So all in all I have to control 30 PWM channels. Therefor I used two TLC5940 which give me 32 (16x2) PWM pins.\nThere is one really good thing about the chip. There are already prewritten libraries for arduino and after some experiments and wrong soldering I found out how to connect the chips to the arduino.\nActually there are a few suggestions on how to connect the chip, but the one I attached to this image works perfectly together with the library you can download a few steps later.Connecting the TLC5940\nYou can operate many of these chips in series. For example, if you want 96 channels, you have to connect 6 of the chips in series. In my case, as already said, two chips are enough. Look at the pictures how I connected all electronics. The hardware setup is based on this project page.\nOne side of the TLC5940 chip is connected to the micro controller and to ground or 5V. The other side consists of 14 output channels. There are two more output pins on the other side of the chip. The most outer pins are output pins 0 and 16. We only need 15 channels per chip so pin 0 will not be used.\nPin 20 of both TLC5940 chips are connected to ground with resistors with a resistance of 390 ohms. That pin is to limit the current flowing through each channel. It's just a reference pin, but pretty useful. According to the datasheet there is one equation to calculate the resistor's value:\nI = 1.24 * (31.5/R)\nBy choosing R = 390 ohm we get\n1.24 * (31.5/390) = 0.100153846\nExactly 100mA and that is okay, because the red channel only takes 90mA on full power, green and blue even less. But if we mess up something, the chip doesn't get destroyed because of high currencies.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FKO/E5C7/GVVOVJVS/FKOE5C7GVVOVJVS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2B/3V3O/GVVOYTRF/F2B3V3OGVVOYTRF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJZ/ON0Z/GVVPBIZ3/FJZON0ZGVVPBIZ3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPH/M13Z/GVVPBIZ4/FPHM13ZGVVPBIZ4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2T/Q8EK/GVVP89PH/F2TQ8EKGVVP89PH.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Controller Unit"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Temperature\nOf course I tested the setup on a prototyping breadboard before soldering everything together and made some tests. I wanted to know if the chip can take full white light on all 15 channels for a longer time. So I illuminated my room with 5 LED strips fully on for a few minutes and measured the temperature with my IR-thermometer and with one of my best tools, my hands. It was a little bit hot but didn't get any hotter after one minute or so.Heatsink\nI decided to add a heatsink to the unit. Because I didn't have any dedicated heatsink for such chips, I just cut one of my old broken XBOX 360 heatsinks into two pieces. After that it was still a little bit oversized, but ok. I added some heat transfer paste to the chip and screw the heatsink tightly on top. Do not forget the paste if you want to use a heatsink, because if you do so, the solution is useless.Enclosure\nBecause all of the devices are sensitive I put all of them into an enclosure and fixed them with hot glue. Because the enclosure was too tight for the big heatsink I removed it.Cooler\nInstead of the heatsink I wanted to add something else because inside of the closed plastic casing everything would get even hotter. I had a small 12V cooler laying around at home and connected it to 12V directly. The fan was way too fast and too loud to be on all the time I use my system. So I connected it to 3.3V of the arduino and that works very good. It is really quiet and after I added some holes to the case the air can flow through it.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F1H/NFLZ/GVVPBJ2H/F1HNFLZGVVPBJ2H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAQ/IC67/GVVPBJ2F/FAQIC67GVVPBJ2F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUZ/32Z9/GVVOYU1T/FUZ32Z9GVVOYU1T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8R/B4J8/GVVPV9QS/F8RB4J8GVVPV9QS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA6/HNG6/GVVOYU1U/FA6HNG6GVVOYU1U.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Heatsink, Enclosure, Cooler"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Download the zip-file attached to this step. It consists of boblight for windows users, a boblight config file to use with my setup, the sketch for the arduino and a library necessary to run the sketch correctly. Linux users, like me, will be able to find the software by themselfs, I assume.Arduino\nYou have to get my sketch on your micro controller. Therefor go to the arduino download page and download the current version of their software.\nFrom my zip file take the TLC5940 library and copy it to YOUR_ARDUINO_FOLDER/libraries to make it available to the arduino IDE. The library is taken from the official homepage of the library.\nTake the ambilight.pde sketch and upload it to your micro controller.The first byte sent from the computer and received by the arduino is always 0xFF to synchronize. Bytes 2-4 are the values to set channels 1-3. And so on. After 16 bytes have been sent, the first TLC5940 has set all of the 15 RGB values for the first 5 LED strips. So the next 15 bytes are meant for the second chip, channels 1-15, to set the other half of the strips.\nChannel 0 of both chips are not connected because they are needless (I said that before).Boblight\nBoblight is by far the best solution to get fast readings from your screen and configurate how to deal with it.\nChange the file boblight.conf just as you need it. Open it with any text editor and see how it is designed. Change the values to your needs.\nMaybe I can help you a little bit. Look at these lines from the file:[light]\nname\u00a0 upper_right_left\ncolor\u00a0 red\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 uCon 17\ncolor\u00a0 green\u00a0\u00a0 uCon 18\ncolor\u00a0 blue\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 uCon 16\nhscan\u00a0 50 75\nvscan\u00a0 0 20\nWhat they mean:\n_______________________\nname\u00a0 upper_right_left\nThe light has got the name upper_right_left. That's one specific strip. It is the second from the right on the top of the tv screen as the name says. It's the left one of the two right on top of the screen. A little bit complicated, but I think you get it.\n----------------------------------------\ncolor\u00a0 red\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 uCon 17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThis line says, that the byte for the red color is sent as byte number 17. That means it will set channel 1 of the second TLC5940. The sync byte (in boblight.conf it's called PREFIX) is not counted in boblight.\n----------------------------------------\ncolor\u00a0 green\u00a0\u00a0 uCon 18\ncolor\u00a0 blue\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 uCon 16\nJust the same for the green and the blue values.\n----------------------------------------\nhscan\u00a0 50 75\nvscan\u00a0 0 20\nThis says what area of the screen belongs to the strip. It's from 50% to 75% horizontally. So just from the half of the screen to 3/4 from left to right. The second line tells us, that only the upper 20% (from 0 to 20) will be analyzed. And, as already said, it is the second from the right on top of the screen.\n---------------------------------------\nAll of the other strips are specified similarly.\nTo run boblight, first start the daemon (boblightd) and then the screen-analyzer (boblight-getpixel on windows or boblight-X11 on linux).\nI hate to say that, but Windows Vista and Windows 7 users have to disable their aero theme while using the system because one function boblight uses (getPixel()) is not supported in combination with aerothemes. Deactivate the theme by right clicking on your Desktop. Then choose 'Personalize' and click on 'Windows 7 Basic'.\nRedo that after your movie has finished.Change the source code\nFor those of you who want to take more or less TLC5940 chips, do not forget to change the number of your chips in tlc_config.h in the TLC library and change the source code of the sketch and the boblight config file, of course. The preconfigured number of TLCs in the library I attached is two, because I changed it.", "step_imgs": ["/assets/img/pixel.png"], "step_title": "Step 4: Software"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "In the old instructable a lot of questions have been asked about the prices of the components I used.

I resold two meters for 12 euros because I only needed 2.5 meters for my setup. So I only payed 18 euros. You can save some money by using LED strips with only 30 LEDs per meter.\nBoth TLC5940 chips together costed 3.50 euros.\nThe Arduino Duemilanove I bought is just a clone, but it's completely okay and it works perfectly. It was 15 euros from Hong Kong.\nI already owned all of the other things I needed, but I assume they do not cost more than 10 euros.\nAll together the price is 55.50 euros.\nThe two images I attached shell give you an idea of the resolution the system can offer. All 10 lights have slightly different colors. With my incredible painting skills I also added a few stripes to show you how I taped them to my tv.\nAlso notice the last picture showing the strips in reality taped to the back.

The name of the model comes from the initials of the three additive primary colors, red, green, and blue.The main purpose of the RGB color model is for the sensing, representation, and display of images in electronic systems, such as televisions and computers, though it has also been used in conventional photography. Before the electronic age, the RGB color model already had a solid theory behind it, based in human perception of colors. RGB is a device-dependent color model: different devices detect or reproduce a given RGB value differently, since the color elements (such as phosphors or dyes) and their response to the individual R, G, and B levels vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, or even in the same device over time. Thus an RGB value does not define the same color across devices without some kind of color management. Typical RGB input devices are color TV and video cameras, image scanners, video games, and digital cameras. Typical RGB output devices are TV sets of various technologies (CRT, LCD, plasma, OLED, Quantum-Dots etc.), computer and mobile phone displays, video projectors, multicolor LED displays, and large screens such as JumboTron. Color printers, on the other hand, are not RGB devices, but subtractive color devices (typically CMYK color model).RGB has come a long way, it's affordable, easy to use and has the abilities within it to create anything you can imagine.

Amazon has good pricing on them if your in the market for The DUMB lights I'm posting here.Do your research online retailers sell these items for a hefty price. Big retailers like amazon can get you a price that is reasonable and won't break the bank. They run on a 12 volt power source so usually on places like amazon you have to buy these separate or pay a ridiculous price. But here is what I did. I went to my local thrift store and raided all the 12 volt power supplies that I could find. I ended up with more than a dozen of them for right around .35 cents each. If I bought these online like at amazon I would have paid anywhere from 7.00 to 13.00. If you can find an old phone set at the local thrift these types of phone usually runs on 12 volt power. If you can't find any lose power supplies you can always buy the phone and discard it and use that power supply and your only out a couple bucks.Online Specialty store like light in the box, lightorama and others charge upward of 40.00 plus for these same lights you can get on amazon for less than 15.00 in some cases.

Each LED has it's own color RED GREEN BLUE, depending on which color you choose to use depends on how the lights will react. For instance if you choose blue you will only light the blue led, spaced every three lights apart. if you choose say a purple red and blue will light etc. yellow all three you get my point? These lights don't give versatility like others on the market do. The 3528 is a good way to go for small areas that you want that extra accent for not much else.5050 RGB Strip: By far, better than the 3528. Each pixel is capable of RED GREEN BLUE capacity, they blend the colors to a smooth fade rather than using individual pixels to accomplish it. They also come in water proof or not water proof and are capable of thousands of colors. There's no space in between colors so you get a rich color seamlessly. They are bright and dimmable as well.

Based off the specs on the website I would need about 1.5A to power the lights:Input Voltage: 12V DC Power Consumption: 4.4W / 367mA per ft.(0.367A/ft * 4ft = ( 4.4 W/ft * 4ft) / 12V = ~1.5A ) The dimmer can handle up 3A per channel so that's no issue and in the end\u00a0 I opted for a power supply that was capable of 3A.Note: Red boxes in wiring diagram represent connectors.Physical For this part you will really have to get a hold of the major components you plan to use and play around with them to see how they can work together.

Mount the standoffs that the dimmer will sit on 3. Test-fit dimmer and plan out the rest of the components' locations 4.

Then, once you've made sure one more time that the strip is of the correct length, take of the adhesive strip protection on the back of the LEDs off and carefully put the LEDs on your monitor.Unless you're really confident in your soldering skills, I would recommend to tape the wire near the contact to reduce strain on the soldered contact. I also led the wire behind the stand for the sake of cable management.Adding an on/off switch to the wire can be useful, since you won't need the light to be on when there's enough daylight present.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8N/X8ZV/I88LP2I5/F8NX8ZVI88LP2I5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2S/NOJW/I88LP285/F2SNOJWI88LP285.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY1/7I89/I88LP2I4/FY17I89I88LP2I4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJA/X4DS/I88LP2JR/FJAX4DSI88LP2JR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTF/NABA/I88LP1GA/FTFNABAI88LP1GA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD8/ISUW/I8BGF7TL/FD8ISUWI8BGF7TL.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2:  Attaching the LEDs to the Monitor"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Depending on what connectors you have left on your PSU, create a connector for the LED strip to the PSU.

That makes finding things in there very hard, and I\u2019m already bad at looking for stuff. So I decided these closets needed lights. I wanted something that would turn on automatically when you open the door, disperse light around the closet evenly and not just in the top, and wouldn\u2019t take too much energy to run if the door was left open by accident. So here\u2019s what I came up with.Its a simple LED light strip mounted around the inside of the door frame, all the way around, pointing in towards the closet to provide front illumination. It\u2019s much more evenly distributed than a top down lighting system where you have a bright top shelf and dark floors. It\u2019s got a simple magnetic switch that is operated when the door is opened or closed and it can be attached to a simple dimmer to control how bright the light levels are. The system can be run from an LED driver plugged into a wall outlet, connected to a 12v battery if an outlet is not available, or run up into the ceiling to connect to a normal socket (which I dont have in my closets but you can use if you want to retrofit an existing closet light). One of our closets doesn\u2019t even have close access to an outlet, so it was set up to run off a security system 5 Amp-hour battery that sits on the floor inside the corner of the door frame, and I occasionally take it out to recharge it. (About once every 9 months, so not too annoying.) If you're interested in seeing my other projects, check out my website at www.sampaulling.comHere\u2019s how to do it.", "title": "LED Closet Lighting", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/LED-Closet-Lighting-1/", "section": "workshop", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "LED Light StripThe LED light strip is the core of this build. Measure the height (x2) and add in the top width of the door frame, and then add about another 1\u2032 of extra. This will be enough to get you around the frame, but you may want to include a few feet of light strip underneath some of the shelves as well, so add a few more feet there. (I\u2019d recommend doing this only if you have a lip on the front of your shelves, as seeing the LED strip directly is very bright. You want them hidden.30W LED Supply DriverThe LED Supply Driver is what converts your house 120V system to the 12V required to use LED light strips. These drivers come in all shapes and sizes, but the 30W driver provides enough power for a whole closet full of lights without being overkill. It\u2019s fairly bulky, about 2\u2033W x 1\u2033H x 12\u2033L, so make sure you have some place to mount it. Mine is underneath my kitchen cabinets.Magnetic SwitchThe Magnetic Switch is what you will stick to both the door and the door frame, very close together, and that will allow the door to control whether or not power flows to the LED lights. If you don\u2019t use this, you will either need to install some kind of light switch or be ok with the lights being on all the time. (kind of wasteful)LED DimmerThe LED Dimmer is a control knob that can be wired into the system to control how much power gets to the lights. Just like a dimmer you probably have in other rooms of your house. I originally wanted one of these in the closet to control how bright the lights are, but I found max brightness to be ok at pretty much all times (unless you want to get a late night snack and the light is overpowering in the darkness) You can use this, or not.Miscellaneous SuppliesOther things you will need: Wire. I normally use standard 16 ga speaker wire for my LED projects, but if you don\u2019t have some, grab some from this link Wire Strippers \u2013 for stripping wire.Soldering Iron \u2013 for making connections between wire and LED strips.

We start at the wall outlet under the kitchen cabinets, flow through the LED driver to convert to 12V power, go through a small hole in the wall, down the inside of the closet, the red wire goes through the magnetic switch, and then meets up with the black wire at the dimmer. The dimmer outlet then connects to a new set of wires that runs to the LED strip, which then runs all the way around the door. Once you physically place the components, stick them in place with some double sided tape (the LED\u2019s should have sticky tape on the back already) and begin laying out your wire. I used a light duty upholstry staple gun to make my wires run straight and sit tight against the wall and this keeps them from looking unfinished and droopy. Parallel LED Strips If you want to connect more than 1 strip of continuous LED\u2019s, you can. You attach the strips in parallel, all connected to the same point at the dimmer. Red and black wires go from there out to each LED strip, no matter where it is. Each LED strip has its own connection. Your build will likely look a bit different than this. You may not have to go through a wall to get wires into the closet. You may not have a closet near an outlet, but you could tap into a ceiling light fixture with a screw in outlet that would take the place of a normal bulb. You may choose to run a closet off battery power. (I\u2019ll include a picture of this at the bottom) How Many LEDS to RunYou can only run as many LEDs as your driver is rated to handle. This particular drive is 30 Watts, and each foot of this LED tape requires 1.5 watts, so you could run, at max, 20 feet of light tape. Ideally, you don\u2019t want to max out your supply because it will run hot, so this 30w driver is designed to work perfectly with these 16.5 foot LED strips. If you need more lights, for something like a master bedroom closet lighting system, get a bigger driver. 50w or 100w or even bigger.", "step_imgs":

blog.\u00a0 It's a bit of a pet peeve that all these fantastic ideas are flaunted but never produced.\u00a0 So, I set about making my own wooden desk lamp, and I am extremely pleased with the results.\u00a0 The lamp that served as the inspiration for the Woodpunk actually has since gone into limited production, but of course it's ridiculously expensive.\u00a0 And besides, I still like mine better!\nThe majority of the lamp is made of 1/4\" and 1/2\" Baltic Birch plywood.\u00a0 I love using this stuff to make things - a quick skim of my other instructables will confirm that!\u00a0 It's strong and stable and easy to cut - and it's made of a renewable resource!\u00a0 What's not to love?\u00a0 Wood dowels serve as the joints.\u00a0 The springs and socket were stolen from two old lamps; one skillfully located at a thrift store by my wife, and the other was just taking up space in my house (and also \"donated\" by my wife).\u00a0 The LED lamp draws just 3W to produce 180 lumens, enough to illuminate a small work area.\u00a0 It was bought at DealExtreme, but nearly any LED bulb with an integrated reflector would work just as well.\nTotal cost for this project was $25-$30.\n\t\u00a0\nNow, you may be thinking, \"Hey - this looks ideal for a laser cutter or CNC machine!\"\u00a0 Well, you're right.\u00a0 At the moment my designs need a bit of work so they're actually compatible with an automated system - anyone willing to do the conversion?\u00a0 There's a 3-month pro membership for the first person who does!\nSo, have you got access to a scroll saw and drill press?\u00a0 That's pretty much all you need to make this awesome lamp!UPDATE:\u00a0 KChappers generously converted my designs to .dwg, .dxf and .cdr formats for your CNC, laser cutter and 3D

they will definitely need to be modified!\nWhen designing the lamp, I took measurements from an existing lamp I use at my workbench.\u00a0 I noticed that all of the \"arms\" are made of equal-length sections, connected by triangular \"joints.\"\u00a0 This made the design relatively easy - just two parallelograms with a \"shoulder\" at the base, an \"elbow\" in between, and a \"wrist\" where the arm connects to the reflector.\u00a0 Indeed, you will notice that is exactly how I labeled the parts.\nIn addition, there's the base and various spacers.\nEverything is designed to be cut out of either 1/4\" or 1/2\" plywood.\u00a0 Since there are many identical parts, you can stack the 1/4\" wood and cut it in pairs.\u00a0 Not only is this faster, it also ensures that the joints are precisely aligned (this is important for the arms and joints especially).\nThe patterns are intended to be printed out on 11x17\" paper - if you don't have this capability at home, any business supply store or print shop will be able to print the patterns for you.\u00a0 I printed mine at work.\nAlso note that you may need to modify the design of the reflector section to suit the lightbulb socket you've got - the diameter may need to be increased or decreased, for example.\nIncluded below are the preliminary patterns - I plan to clean them up soon, to make the whole thing easier to build!A

may use for cutting out the stacked pieces is to stick a short piece of dowel in two of the holes.\u00a0 This will prevent the pieces from shifting far better than the tape is able to.\nCut each piece carefully, to the line.\u00a0 In most cases you don't have to be super-precise, though you should be careful when cutting the joints that slot together.\u00a0 These include the reflector, the the joint between the \"shoulders\" and base, and between the \"feet\" and base.\u00a0 Take your time to cut these precisely, so that the pieces fit together later with a minimum of wobble.\nTo do the inside cuts, disconnect the scroll saw blade on one end and feed it through the pilot hole.\u00a0 Reconnect the blade, re-tension it, then cut out.\u00a0 Disconnect the blade again to remove the workpiece.\nThe pieces may now be sanded to remove any rough edges and faces.\u00a0 You can use a belt sander for the edges if you've got one. Sand to the line using the belt sander.\u00a0 One the edges are are sanded, remove the paper patterns. If the paper won't come off easily, heat it up a bit with a heat gun. The adhesive will release easily, but you'll need to sand the residue smooth. Lightly sand the faces of all the pieces, and sand the corners to remove any burrs.\nOne final step is to drill holes through the 1/2\" spacer pieces.\u00a0 The cord will eventually pass through these holes, which are drilled perpendicular to the main 1/2\" hole in the center.\u00a0 Using one of the scraps to support the spacer, and a clamp to hold it perpendicular, drill one or more holes large enough to accept the cord.\u00a0 This is a tricky operation, and a nice brad point drill bit really does wonders here.", "step_imgs":

various lengths for its joints.\u00a0 Be careful when purchasing the dowels; though some may be advertised as 1/2\", for example, but they might be slightly more or less.\u00a0 In my case, there were two different diameters in the bin at Home Depot - one that was exactly 1/2\", and one that was slightly less!\u00a0 One great way of making sure you get the right size is to bring a piece of scrap wood drilled with a 1/2\" hole, and try them out right in the store.\nFrom 1/2\" round dowel, cut the following:\n6 x 1.5\" long\n2 x 2\" long\n1 x 1\" long\n3 x 0.5\" long\nFrom 1/4\" round dowel, cut the following:\n1 x 1.5\"\n1 x 2\"\n2 x 1.75\"\nSand the ends of each dowel to remove any burrs and roughness.\u00a0 Don't sand the sides at all, or the dowels will fit too loose!\u00a0 Depending on the thickness of the Baltic Birch plywood, these dowels may be up to 1/16\" too long - simply sand or trim flush as necessary during the Assembly stage.\nNow, for a bit of a tricky step.\u00a0 Drill a 1/2\" hole into a piece of scrap wood.\u00a0 Insert each of the 0.5\" long, 1/2\" diameter pieces in the hole, and drill a 1/4\" hole straight through the center.\u00a0 The piece of scrap helps hold the short dowel in place, and parallel to the drill bit.\u00a0 Do the same for the 1\" long 1/2\" dowel.\nTwo of the 1/4\" dowels will need a little notch cut in the ends to prevent the springs from slipping off.\u00a0 With the scroll saw or a small hand saw, cut notches on either end of the pictured dowels, about 1/4\" from the end.", "step_imgs":

{"step": 7, "steps_text": "\n          Ah, the moment of truth!\u00a0 So, you've got a table littered with parts, ready to put together.\u00a0 I suggest dry-fitting everything to start, before adding glue and making things permanent.\u00a0 This way, you can determine the order in which the pieces go together, and find any mistakes (but you didn't make any, right?)\nAssemble the base first, it's the easiest.\u00a0 Slot a foot onto each space.\u00a0 Some may fit better than others in certain spaces, so fit as many as you can without having to bust out the sandpaper.\u00a0 In some cases though, you may have to sand or cut a little bit of wood to make something fit.\u00a0 If you're planning to clamp the base to a table, install the feet \"upside down,\" so the base sits flush on a surface.\u00a0 Once the base is finished, set it aside.\nDo the \"reflector\" next.\u00a0 Slot in the three fingers.\u00a0 Hopefully they'll stay in by friction alone, otherwise you'll have to carefully hold them in place until the light bulb socket is slid in the middle.\u00a0 With the light fixture in place, the whole reflector should hold together.\u00a0 Set it aside as well.\nNow it's time for the arm.\u00a0 Lay out the \"joints\" first, then slide in the 1/2\" dowels.\u00a0 The arms and spacers will slide onto these.\u00a0 The assembly should go roughly like this:\n\t- The curved 1/2\" arm sections each have a 1/4\" spacer on either side.\u00a0 4 per arm section.\u00a0 These go on the outside of the arm.\n\t- The straight 1/4\" arm sections that make up the \"forearm\" have a 1/2\" spacer between them.\u00a0 This pair goes on the inside of the \"elbow\" and \"wrist\" joints.\n\t- The straight 1/4\" arm sections that make up the \"upper arm\" go on the outside of the \"elbow\" and \"shoulder\" joints.\n\t- A single 1/4\" dowel spans the distance between the third position on the shoulder.\u00a0 The springs for the upper arm attach to this dowel.\n\t- The 2\" long 1/4\" dowel is inserted through two of the 0.5\" long dowel pieces, which in turn connect to one of the 1/2\" holes on the straight sections of the upper arm.\u00a0 The other end of the \"upper arm\" springs attach here.\u00a0 The exact distance depend on the length of the springs.\n\t- One of the 1.5\" long 1/4\" dowels is inserted through the 1\" long dowel with a hole drilled through.\u00a0 The other is inserted through a 0.5\" long dowel with a hole.\u00a0 These are positioned on the \"forearm\" at such a distance that the springs are not stretched when the arm is \"raised\"\u00a0 That is, the springs should support the weight of the arm.\nThe reflector assembly is attached at the \"wrist\" using a 2\" long 1/4\" diameter screw, held tight with a butterfly nut.\u00a0 Two washers prevent the screw and nut from cracking the wood.\u00a0 Place a 1/4\" spacer on either side (2 total), and tighten the nut to hold the reflector at the desired angle.\nFinally, slot the entire arm into the base.\u00a0 If the spring tensions are set properly, the arm should stay where you move it.\u00a0 At this point, be mindful that none of the joints pop out.\u00a0 Remember, they're not glued yet!",

Woodpunk LED lamp is big, and a little heavy.\u00a0 Well, not that much heavier than a metal desk lamp, but enough that the \"upper arm\" can't extend past vertical without the whole thing tipping over.\u00a0 So what to do?\nWell, if you're planning to clamp the lamp to a table, there is nothing to be done.\u00a0 Skip this step.\nBut, if you'd like it to be freestanding, you'll need to add a counterweight to the base.\u00a0 Most desk lamps will have this of course so I shouldn't feel so bad about having to include this step.\u00a0 I really should have integrated the weights into the design a bit better, but oh well.\nIncluded in the designs is a small box that can be assembled, filled with something heavy, and attached under the base to keep it weighed down.\u00a0 The box is made of four layers, two of 1/2\" wood and two of 1/4\".\u00a0 When stacked together, the box is a bit shorter than the \"toes\" on the base, and so it slips discreetly underneath.\u00a0 Cut out the pieces by stacking, as with the other pieces, then glue together the bottom and sides.\u00a0 Clamp until dry.\u00a0 There's no need to sand smooth just yet...\nFill the box with something heavy.\u00a0 I bought a bag of fine lead shot ages ago, that I use exclusively for filling counterweights like this.\u00a0 A far more noble cause than killing small animals, IMO.\u00a0 When filled the box should weigh nearly two pounds.\u00a0 Glue on the lid once the box is filled.\nOnce the glue is dry, sand the sides as a single piece to get a nice smooth finish.\u00a0 The counterweight is now ready to be glued to the base of the lamp.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FHT/NTZ3/GDTLSSED/FHTNTZ3GDTLSSED.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F64/RS5F/GDTLSSEE/F64RS5FGDTLSSEE.LARGE.jpg",

where not to glue.\u00a0 Otherwise, the arm may never move!\u00a0 Assuming that everything went well at the assembly stage, partially disassemble the lamp by removing the base and the reflector.\nGlue the reflector \"fingers\" by applying glue to all of the mating surfaces.\u00a0 Wipe off any excess glue.\u00a0 The shape of this piece makes it hard to clamp.\u00a0 But fear not!\u00a0 Grab some twist-ties (or solid core wire, in a pinch) and use one or two per finger to hold the finger tightly to the ring.\u00a0 The light fixture will not be glued in until the wire has been run.\nNext, glue in the \"toes\" to the base.\u00a0 This is pretty straightforward, remove one toe at a time, apply glue to mating surfaces, and slide together again.\u00a0 If the toes fit loosely, make sure they are all coplanar and the base sits level.\u00a0 Prop or reorient the base as it dries if necessary.\u00a0 Make sure to wipe up any excess glue before it dries.\nWhen the \"toes\" are dry, glue the \"counterweight\" to the bottom of the base.\u00a0 Note that this isn't necessary if the base will be clamped to the table.\nAnd now, for the arm itself.\u00a0 The general rule to follow is to only glue the 1/2\" dowel to the outer-most arm piece.\u00a0 Remember, these joints must swivel!\u00a0 Gluing the outermost pieces only ensures that the arm won't fall apart.\u00a0 Set the arm on its side and remove arm sections until the tops of the dowels are exposed.\u00a0 Apply glue to the inside edges of the arm or joint pieces, following the rule above, the slide them on.\u00a0 Doing it this way will ensure that any glue squeeze-out is pushed out where it can be wiped up, rather than into the joint.\nFlip the arm over and do the same thing.\u00a0 Check each joint to make sure the pieces are pressed together.\nNow glue the arm onto the base.\u00a0 Again, apply glue to the mating surfaces, and slide together.\nThe dowels are last. Take the dowels from the upper arms, and glue the 1/4\" pieces in the exact centers of the 1/2\" pieces. You'll then have two dowels, one with a 1/2\" long section glued to the middle, and one with a 1\" section glued to the middle.\u00a0 The first of these is glued in place to the 1/2\" thick arm, closest to the elbow.\u00a0 The second piece is centered and glued to the parallel straight arms, closest to the \"wrist.\"\u00a0 Make sure the notches cut into these dowels face away from each other, so they are able to hold the springs.\u00a0\nLast are the dowels that hold the springs for the \"upper arm,\" between the shoulder and elbow.\u00a0 On one half, glue in place a 1/2\" long drilled out dowel.\u00a0 The exact position of the piece glued to the parallel arms will depend on the length of the springs.\u00a0 Now, apply glue to the dowels themselves, slide them halfway through the holes, and slip on the springs.\u00a0 Push the dowel in the rest of the way to lock the springs in place.\u00a0 This part is rather fiddly, and a pair of needle nose pliers might be helpful.\nOnce all of the glued joints are dry, sand them to remove any glue residue that might remain.\u00a0 If any of the dowels stick out a bit, you may sand them down or cut them flush with a fine saw, or leave them alone.\u00a0 But, if protruding dowels prevent the arm from moving, you'll need to trim them flush.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FT7/3SJ5/GDTZY0CE/FT73SJ5GDTZY0CE.LARGE.jpg",

Also, it would probably be a good idea to paint the pieces before assembling them!\nI used an LED light bulb for my lamp because it looks awesome.\u00a0 Any LED \"spotlight\" you find should work fine

You have just lost your night vision temporarily. But how does night vision work and is it possible to look upon, let\u2019s say a printed star chart, without losing all of that precious low-light adaption your eyes do so well? Yes it is \u2013 using red light!There is a splendid Wikipedia article on low-light adaption, but I will just use this graph to illustrate why it is good for your night vision to use red LEDs that irradiate a wavelength of approx. 625 nm. At this wavelength, the rods that are used in low-light vision, are very insensitive to light and don\u2019t lose their photoactive molecules that generate your vision. But the cones, that give the color impression for red, can see quite well. Now how do we get red  light from LEDs to go without spending a ton? We do it ourselfs of course, using inexpensive materials and stuff we already have. What do we need?1.       A power source \u2013 since everyone has a cell phone that charges from 5V supply, I'm assuming you have a powerbank for recharging your phone (e.g. Anker Astro E1 for 15$ will power your light for up to 50 hours). 2.

For the LEDs i used, that is 2.2 V per LED, giving 4.4V combined. Now we still have to drop at least 0.6 V to not burn our LEDs, which we can do by adding a 33 Ohms resistor in this series. When there is the specified current of 20 mA going throgh the LEDs, the resulting voltage drop will be (33 Ohms times 20 mA equals) 0.66 V, and now we are below the max. specified voltage. If the LEDs you already have or bought have a lower operating voltage, you will want to go for 47 Ohms resistors or even higher using the same simple math.

As you can use a Raspberry Pi Zero or Arduino Nano, the additional costs can also be very limited.The layout of the housing allows to build both photometer and colorimeter from the same parts, just depending on the sensor breakouts and LEDs you will use.So what can you do with the device?A photometer allows to measure the amount of light reaching a sensor. Given you are using a constant light source, and you place a translucent object between light source and sensor, this allows you to calculate the amount of light that gets lost on this way. This defines the optical density of the object. The \"lost\" light could either be absorbed by a dye, or scattered by particles, or a combination of both. So a photometer allows to quantify the optical density of a clear solution, e.g. some ink, or a suspension, like milk or yeast particles in beer, wenn filled into a standard photometer cuvette.A colorimeter allows you to measure the color composition of an object, here of a solution. The sensor used here for the colorimetric device splits the visual spectrum into three channels, red, green and blue (RGB), hereby simulating the way our eyes see colors. For most colors this allows to describe our impression of a color by a combination of three numbers describing the intensity in the three RGB channels, typically defined in 256 steps. So black is 0-0-0, white is 256-256-256, pure red 256-0-0 and so on. Pure yellow would be 256-256-0, pure cyan 0-256-256. But the sensor used here is very precise and allows to discriminate over 67,000 steps for each color channel.Photometers are often used to measure chemical reactions, like changes in the acidity (pH) of a solution, by measurement of the intensity of an indicator dye. For optimal detection you may want to measure only the absorption of light close to the absorption maximum of the dye. Therefore you will prefer to use a monochromatic light source instead of white light. LEDs come in a wide variety of colors, give nearly monochromatic and intensive light with a very stable intensity pattern and are very energy effective. The sensor used for the photometric layout allows you to measure light intensity over a very broad spectrum, from UV to IR, with a very high precision. A variety of indicator dyes are changing their color, e.g. from yellow to blue. Here a colorimetric measurement can allow to demonstrate and quantify this transition process, as the colorimeter described here could also be defined as a three-channel photometer.So you may for example measure the pH, oxygen and CO2 concentrations in your pool or aquarium, or nitrate and lead concentrations in your drinking water. Or just analyse the precise color of your favorite ink, so you may paint your flat in the same color. As the costs per unit are extremely low compared to any commercial devices, it is a nice tool for science classes and hobbyists.

They are defined by a single SVG-file. I am using the laser cutting service of Formulor (Berlin/Germany, 13\u20ac per plate plus shipping), but using the same SVG-file, the parts could also be ordered at Ponoko (US) or RazorLAB(UK) at a similar price. You may choose from a wide variety of colors, but to minimize color artefacts I would recommend black, grey or white.You can find the SVG-file defining the latest tested version at a later step of this instructible.- a sensor breakout: * For the colorimeter, the TCS34725 RGBW-sensor breakout from Adafruit (< 8 US$/\u20ac, www.adafruit.com/products/1334) is used. * For the photometer I use the TSL2591 breakout from Adafruit (< 7 US$/\u20ac, www.adafruit.com/products/1334)    . I ordered both breakouts at Flikto, Germany.- a light source: * For the colorimeter I am using a 5 mm naturally white LED with a narrow emission angle (Nichia NSPW500DS, about 2,20 \u20ac at Conrad, Germany).  Please be aware that a \"white\" LED does not give a homogenous emission spectrum, as sun light, but a sharp blue peak and a bell-shaped emission spectrum with a maximum in the yellow-green range (see image). \"Naturally white\" LEDs emit similar amounts of light in the red, green and blue regions.* For the photometer, a 5 mm LED with a color optimal for the specific analyte shall be used. E.g. for a dark red analyte, you may use a green LED, a yellow LED for a blue dye. You can find an overview of some commercially available LEDs with different colors at a later step.The 5 mm LEDs can be powered either by a two 1.5 V batteries or using the 3.3 V output of the Raspberry Pi. Most yellow, orange and red LEDs will need a series resistor (e.g. 60 Ohm)  to reduce the voltage to 2.1 V.In addition to the above, an assortment of screws, nuts and washers  (2.5 M and 3 M), silicon rubber feet and some cables are required. I also would recommend to use a breadboard to connect RPi and device.A more detailed list is found at a later step.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FBR/D3GL/IN697NA0/FBRD3GLIN697NA0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIG/RON4/INBZ26G8/FIGRON4INBZ26G8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4H/MZJ1/IN3EJN2I/F4HMZJ1IN3EJN2I.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F05/8X6B/IN69COOB/F058X6BIN69COOB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FST/2M2C/INDEFXJE/FST2M2CINDEFXJE.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Basic Layout of the Device; Required Parts"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The parts for the housing are constructed in a way that they fix together precisely, with grooves and tongues, without  gluing. Only the assembly of the lid requires a bit of glue.The pictures shown here may not represent the latest version of the device, as its layout still is subject of ongoing optimization.At first remove the laser cut pieces from the acrylic plate and remove the protection foils from both sides of all pieces.Then try to stick the pieces together, to ensure that all fits well. First connect the central elements with the back and front walls, then add the right and left side pieces. Now try to place this on the base plate and to stick the tongues into the holes of the base plate.They should fit perfectly, but there can be minimal differences in material thickness. So in case you may need to break the edges a bit with a file or sandpaper, just until the pieces fit. Now place the side walls of the cuvette chamber and make sure they fit as well. Now disassemble the pieces again. As a next step assemble the sensor unit. Solder the header to the breakout, according to the instructions found at Adafruit (\"Learn\" on the product specific pages). Now fix the cables to the ports. Make sure to write down which cable is connected to which port (Gnd, Vin, SCL, SDA; LED). Alternatively you may solder the cables directly to the soldering ports. At next fix the breakout to the sensor holding plate using two 2.5M screws, nuts and washers. Depending on the sensor you are using, you may have to turn the sensor holding plate. Adjust in a way that the sensor chip is placed exactly behind the rectangular hole, then tighten the screws.Now stick two nylon M3 screws through the holes in the inner wall element and at the distance piece. Then stick the sensor holding plate onto the screws, allign the placement of the rectangular holes and fix the position with two other nuts.   Now assemble the LED unit. Stick two Nylon M3 screws through the holes of the second inner wall element. Stack the three LED holder elements on the screws, then place the LED into the resulting central hole. Now add the LED fixing piece and fix the stack with two M3 nuts. Make sure that the LED is properly alligned before you tighten the nuts. Connect the cables to the LED. The longer wire is \"plus\", the shorter \"ground\". To check functionality and optimal allignment, connect the LED with your power source, in case adjust the allignment.Now assemble the \"photometer box\" as you have done before. First run the cables through the holes in the back plate.Then stick the tongues of the two plates with sensor and LED into the holes of the back plate, add the front and side plates and place the box on the base plate.

In addition you may need to install the appropriate drivers/kernel support. As you can find very good and detailed instructions on this at the Adafruit website (Adafruit: GPIO/I2C setup), I will not describe this here in any detail. If you succesfully have implemented I2C on the Pi, connect the sensor with Ground, Vin (I use 3.3V) SDA and SCL. In the case of the RGB sensor you also need to turn off the build-in LED by connecting the LED line with Ground. Check if the sensor can be found by entering \"sudo i2cdetect -y 1\" at the shell. Unfortunatelly both sensors are using the same I2C adress, 0x29, so you can't use them in paralell. Now you need to install some software to perform your measurements. Luckily Python programs to read the data from the sensors were already available, so I only had to modify the TCS34725 software provided by Adafruit (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_TCS34725) and the TSL2591 software by \"MaxlKlaxl\" (https://github.com/maxlklaxl/python-tsl2591 ) a bit to adjust them for my purposes. I like to thank both of them for their brilliant work.In the accompanying software package you will find examples of programs that will allow to perform measurement series and kinetics with both sensors. As I am rather new to Phyton programing, the programs require some optimization, I appreciate any help. Depending on your light source and your specific application, you may need to change the data sampling time and/or sensor gain settings of the sensors.White, UV, blue and green LEDs run at about 3.1 V, so you may power them directly from the Pis' 3.3V output. For yellow, orange and red LEDs you need a series resistor between LED and power, otherwise they will be distoyed. If you do not want to run the LEDs permanently, you may connect them to a GPOI and switch them on and off by software.So far I have not performed any experiments with the Arduino or Trinket, but Adafruit provides libraries and scetches for both sensors.

I am using disposable cuvettes made from polystyrene (PS) or acrylic, and both full volume and semi-micro cuvettes work. You may get 100 such cuvettes for about 12- 20 \u20ac, depending on type and material, and you may use them several times.So basically fill a sufficient volume of the solution/suspension into the cuvette, place it in the device watching for correct orientation, close the lid and start to measure. Given you are using a Raspberry Pi, you will have to start a Python program that allows you to perform the type of measurement (single, multiple, kinetic) you like to. Some of my programs write the data to so called CSV (Comma separated values) files you may open with MS Excel or LibreOffice Calc, Word or Writer and several other programs. This simplifies subsequent data analysis and documentation. I have also written a simple Pygame script to show the color defined by the measured RGB values on your computer screen, so you may compare the actual and the measured colors. For various reasons they might differ a bit.Make sure that the dye concentrations are not too high. Be aware that e.g. a bright blue solution might already be pitch black under the light of a yellow or red LED.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F6F/S2RF/IN69COYW/F6FS2RFIN69COYW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Performing Measurements"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "So far I have performed only a limited set of measurements.An example for a kinetic measurement is the slow evaporation of carbondioxide (CO2) from sparkling water placed in an open cuvette. For this purpose, a bit of bromothymol blue was added to normal water and a small volume of CO2-enriched, \"sparkling\" water was added until the color changed from blue to yellow. Now the kinetics measurement was started and measurements were taken every 20 minutes for several hours. The data was automatically written to a CSV file and later analysed using LibreOffice Calc. So what is happening? By addition of carbon dioxide to water it gets acid. As the concentration of CO2 in air is much lower than in the water, it evaporates slowly from the water, which results in a rising pH. In an acid solution bromothymol blue is faintly yellow, while under basic conditions it is bright blue. Around pH 7.0, the pKa of the dye, the color of the solution is green, due to a mixture of yellow and blue forms of the dye. Using the RGB sensor, it is possible to detect the decay of the yellow form in the blue channel and the increase of the blue form in the red channel, while the effect on the green channel is only moderate. As you can see in the chart, over time the absorption in the blue channel decreases (i.e. less yellow dye) and the absorption in the red channel increases (i.e. more blue dye).  As expected, the color changes over time indicate an approximate first order decay kinetic, values asymptotic nearing maximum or minimum valuesThe same process has also been measured with the photometer. The sensor gives you two values: a full spectrum value (Full) and a value of a second incorporated sensor which measures only the infrared (IR) part of the spectrum. The values of the visible part of the spectrum (VIS) can be estimated by subtraction of IR from Full values. The dye used here was phenol red, which is yellow in acids, red under neutral and violet under basic conditions. Its pKa is also around 7.0. The light source used here was a green LED, so the increase in \"redness\" resulted in a diminished amount of green light reaching the sensor.

Most buttons and small switches will handle 100mA or so. More rugged switches, such as those used in power supplies, will handle a few amps.In many projects you want the LED do something, such as blinking, without you pushing a button constantly. While most basic chips and circuits are able do drive a standard LED at 20mA, they are likely to be damaged at higher loads. For example the ATMEGA328P, the chip of the ARDUINO, can  only deliver around 20mA (40mA, if you stress the chip to the limit).To provide a higher current the signal needs to be amplified. Fortunately this is a fairly easy!For this task usually one of the following components is chosen:(Bipolor) Transistor    (Mos-)FET These parts come in two types, NPN & PNP or N-Channel & P-Channel, respectively. While both types can be used to switch LEDs, NPN transistors and N-channel FETs require less circuitry to work. For now we'll stick to the simple solution.NPN transistors and N-channel FETs will be used as a \"low side switch\", meaning they cut the connection between the LEDs and gound. Although it seems counter-intuitive at first  it does not matter whether a load (such as an LED) is switched. Current flow requires a conducting path from the plus to the minus terminal. As soon as this loop is broken, it doesn't matter where, the current will stop flowing.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSW/WPFM/IT22YC1O/FSWWPFMIT22YC1O.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: On & Off"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Bipolar transistors are best suited for light to medium loads. They are cheap, widely available and often come in THT packages. The example project: Ambient light activated lampThe operating conditions:3 white LEDs are connected in  series with a resistor          ILED = 30mA (total current to switch)          The logic signal voltage is          UIO = 5VThe transistor chosen is the common BC817/BC337, but almost any will work   The circuit:The circuit consits of two parts, the LEDs in series with R1 and the transistor with R2. The external circuitry provides a 5V signal if the LEDs should be turned on.LEDs & R1: The first thing you need to do is to calculate the value of R1 as described in chapter 2 - LEDs in Series.Transistor & R2: A bipolar transistor is turned on by a current flow from its base (B) to its emitter (E). The larger this current is, the more current can flow from its collector (C) to its emitter. Those currents are called IBE and ICE, respectively. Their ratio is called GAIN.     IBE * GAIN = ICE.The gain varies a LOT in between parts, across temperature and current. For reliable results it is crucial to pick the lowest possible value from the datasheet for these calculations (see picture above). With the LED current and the the gain you can calculate the required switching current:     IBE = ICE / GAIN = ILED / GAINNow it is important to know that the connection from B to E is a diode, hence the little diode-like arrow in the schematic. This this BE-diode has a forward voltage of  about 0.7V. To set the current through it a resistor is required. Fortunatly the calculations are identical to those of a single LED. R2 = (UIO - UBE) / IBE = (UIO - UBE) * GAIN / ILEDWith our values this results in:    R2 = (5V - 0.7V) * 100 / 0.03A = 14.3k\u03a9R2 may be sligtly smaller than calculated to ensure IBE is large enough to drive the LEDs. Therefore    R2\u2248 12k\u03a9Transistor power dissipation:  Lastly we need to check if the transistor can handle the load without overheating. The maximum power disapation can be found in the datasheet:Ptot = 250mWThe power dissipated is calculated as:    P = PBE + PCE = UBE * IBE + UCE * ICEPBE is so small that we'll ignore it. UCE depends on ICE as Fig 8.  from the datasheet shows. To illustrate how to read the diagram I've uploaded an annotated screenshot. The \"@\" below refers to a specific operating condition, in this case UCE is depended on ICE.

The LEDs are a 2m long 5050 LED strip     with 120LEDs       ILED = 0.8AThe logic signal voltage is       UIO = 5VThe mosfet choosen is the common AO3400, it has a low on-resistance   The circuit:The circuit consits of two parts, the LED strip and the mosfet with R2. The external circuitry provides a 5V signal if the LEDs should be turned on. Mosfet & R2:   Unlike a transistor a mosfet is turned on by a voltage between its gate (G) and its source (S). This voltage is called VGS. As soon as VGS exceeds a certain threshold the connection from the drain (D) to the source will turn into a resistor with a very low value, RDS(ON).There is no current flowing into the gate of a mosfet, and thus no resistor to limit the current is required. Instead  R2 switches the mosfet off when no signal is applied. Its value is not critical and can be anything from 1k\u03a9 to 100k\u03a9.   Mosfet turn-on voltage:  Some mosfets can require a quite high voltage (VGS) to turn on completely. If a part contains information like    RDS(ON) (at VGS = 4.5V) < XX m\u03a9in the datasheet, it means it can be controlled voltages larger 4.5V. This information can also be hidden in the parameter tables, so check them carefully!Mosfet power dissipation:  Again we check if the part is suitable for the load. The maximum power dissipation is    Ptot = 1.4WThe power dissipated is calculated as:P = RDS(ON) * IDS\u00b2This resuslts in     P = 33m\u03a9 * (0.8A)\u00b2 = 21.12mWUnder the identical conditions a BC817 transistor would generate    P = UCE * ICE = 300mV * 0.8A = 240mWin heat, which pushing it to its limits. If the ambient temperature is higher than 25\u00b0C the transistor would operate beyond it's rating and fail soon.

The simplest solution is to increase the value of the resistor. Doubling the resistor value results in about half the current through the LED. This is common practice in the industry for simple applications, but has three major disadvantages:The brightness is fixed      LEDs are non-linear, making it hard to set the  brightness precisely      At lower currents some LEDs change their color slightly  There are several circuits to to solve the first issue:Widely used are potentiometers, which are nothing but variable resistors. They come with either a knob or a slider to change the resistance from 0% to 100%. Add a normal resistor with the minimum resistance required in series to ensure the LED always stays within operating condition, even when the potentiometer is set to 0% (so basically no resistor at all).Another option is to use switches to select a certain resistor. You can a also use a simple on/off switch to 'switch in' a resistor parallel to the 'main' resistor to decrease the total value. Just make sure the total value is still higher than the minimum resistance. This method is especially useful if you only need a few modes of operation, e.g. bright, medium and dim for a flashlight.There are a variety of circuits which do not require user control. Instead they use  analog parts such as transistors or operational amplifiers to set various currents.   As far as I know there are no current regulating circuits which can  fix issue number 2 & 3. This does not render analog dimming useless, though.

Literally.Human eyes are slow. For a film around 24 frames per second (fps) are enough that out brain merges it into a moving image. The same thing can be done with LEDs. Turn them on and off fast enough and we won't see a blinking LED, but an LED with lower brightness. To see continuous light the switching frequency needs to be higher than for a film, 100Hz at minimum and up to a few kHz for moving objects. The unit hertz - Hz for short - is the frequency and can be interpreted as cycles per second. In each cycle the LED will be turned on for some time and off till the next cycle starts. The emmited light is proportional to the on time compared to the duration of a single period. The diagram above illustrates the typical driving signal.Do note however that the brightness perceived by humans is not equal to the amount of emitted light. This allows us to distinguish light and dark colors at very bright and dim light conditions. Correcting for that is possible, but requires more advanced code or circuitry. As such it won't be covered here, but might be included in future chapters.The benefits over analog dimming are:great control & color accuracy       simple & small circuitry       lower power consumption Obviously no human can push a button that fast. But electronics can. There is a variety of circuits without microcontrollers which can generate PWM signals. Commonly used is the astable multivibrator based on two transistors or the IC NE555. While the basic design is quite simple it can be hard to tweak the values of all components. For advanced discrete (i.e. without a microcontroller) LED circuits I highly recommend to check out simpletronic's instructables. His projects go far beyond usual maker's circuits by using nothing but standard components.For the remaining chapter we'll generate PWM waveforms with a micorcontroller. It can be programmed as you like, has many outputs (for many LEDs), and is widely available. In this guide we'll be using the ATMEGA328P, the chip used in many ARDUINOs, but other controllers will work as well. illustration source:  https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pwm_5step...", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FS9/563R/ISYTJII7/FS9563RISYTJII7.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Digital Dimming"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Pulse Width Modulation - PWM for short - is the correct technical term for digital dimming. It can be also used for many other applications beside controlling LEDs, therefore most microcontrollers have specialized hardware build-in.To get started connect either a single LED directly or a group of LEDs through a transistor/mosfet to the PWM output OC0B of the ATMEGA328P/ ARDUINO. Each of the six build in PWM channels can be controlled individually while running your normal application code! If more channels are desired you need to switch the IOs within your application code, which is called Soft-PWM.This step is all about code required to set up and run a PWM channel. While this is not an introduction to programming, basic knowledge will be enough to follow along. To get in touch with the inner workings of the chip, all registers (the internal settings storage) will be accessed directly in C and not through some fancy library. It may take a bit longer to learn, but performance is worth it!The example project:  Brightness adjustable 5050 LED strip lampThe circuit:The circuit is taken from \"Chapter Switching - N-Channel Mosfet\", the external circuitry is replaced with the microcontroller. The schematic shows the minimum of external components required for the ATMEGA328P, they are all included on every ARDUINO board.   The goal:    Usually there is some sort of input, such as a button, a knob or a sensor, to determine the output brightness. To keep things as simple as possible we'll program in a fixed value. Feel free to expand the program to suit your needs! Preparation: The official datasheet is always the #1 resource for any question you have about a particular component. If you haven't done so, download and open the complete datasheet of the ATMEGA328P. On mobile this can be quite a hassle, therefore I've included the relevant parts as screenshots above. (All screenshots of the datasheet are property of Atmel and are not covered by the licence of this instructable)All code is written in AtmelStudio (which is available for free here) and uploaded with an AVR Dragon ISP Programmer. It should work just as well in the ARDUINO programming environment, although I have to admit I've never tried it. Please let me know if there are any issues with the code.Every new project contains:#include <avr/io.h>\n\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    /* Replace with your application code */\n    while (1)\n    {\n        /* main loop */\n    }\n}\nThe #include <avr/io.h> defines all registers with short names instead of just numbers. After power on the microcontroller strats executing code beginning from int main(void). After a few initializations the main loop while (1) is started, which continues until power is turned off.The Timer/Counter0: The most basic timer is Timer0 (p. 93-110). On power on it is disabled like all other peripherals to prevents unintentional behaviour. The timer has multiple modes of operation with additional settings. For LEDs the Fast PWM Mode (p. 99) is generally best suited.   How it works: In Fast PWM Mode the timer is counting from 0 to 255 and begins then from 0 again. The change from 255 to 0 is called overflow. The current timer value is stored in the register TCNT0 (p. 108), which can be read ad modified in software. The timer module features two Output Compare Registers (OCR0A & OCR0B). One setting enables a continues comparison between these two values:When TCNT0 < OCR0B \u21d2 output on \u21d2 LED on     When TCNT0 \u2265 OCR0B \u21d2 output off \u21d2 LED offTo get \u00bc of the total brightness OCR0B must be set to 63, which is \u00bc of the maximum 255 steps. The figure 15-6 from the datasheet illustrates this.   Configuration - Mode Setting: To load this setting the Control Register A (TCCR0A) (p. 104) needs to be written:TCCR0A = (1<<COM0B1)|(0<<COM0B0)          // Turn output off when TCNT0 >= OCR0B\n        |(1<<WGM01)|(1<<WGM00);           // Select Fast PWM Mode\nTo write to a register type its name TCCT0A the value after a = . The expression (1<<COM0B1) turns on the bit at the position of COM0B1. A | combines all individual bits to a single byte. All other bytes are set to 0. Before flashing AtmelSudio turns the well readable code into the byte 0b00100011, resulting in a very fast execution on the chip.   Configuration - Frequency Setting:    One cycle takes 256 steps to complete. Depending on the setting and external parts the ATMEGA328P runs at 1MHz (default factory setting), 8MHz (max frequency of internal RC oscillator) or 16MHz (with external crystal, default on all ARDUINO boards). The PWM frequency can be calculated with:    fPWM = fclock / stepsWith values above this resuslts in:    fPWM = 3906Hz @ fclock = 1MHz   fPWM = 31250Hz @ fclock = 8MHz   fPWM = 62500Hz @ fclock = 16MHz  To avoid unforeseen issues (high switching losses, crosstalk, EMI) it is the best practice to keep all frequency as low as possible. To archive this the Timer0 features a prescaler which can divide the clock by 1, 8, 64, 256 or 1024. Setting a prescaler value also turns turns the timer on. Assuming the clock is running at either 8MHz or 16MHz a prescaler of 256 results in the lowest frequency above 100hz.    fPWM = 31250Hz/256 \u2248 122Hz @ fclock = 8MHz     fPWM = 62500Hz/256 \u2248 244Hz @ fclock = 16MHz It is set by writing to the Control Register B (TCCR0B) (p. 107):TCCR0B\t= (0<<CS02)|(1<<CS01)|(0<<CS00);   // Start timer with prescaler of /8Configuration - Enable Output: By default all IOs are configured as inputs to prevent damage to external circuitry. This setting also applies to the timer. The corresponding output to the PWM channel OC0B is PD5. This is done with: DDRD\t|= (1<<DDD5);                      // Enable the output for the IO PD5  A normal = forces all other bits to zero which is highly impractical for IO ports. Instead |= is used to set the individual bit. To turn of any amount of bits (examble for PD5 & PD6) use: DDRD\t&= ~((1<<PD5)|(1<<PD6));Configuration - Brightness Setting: Currently the LED is running at the default brightness value of 0. To change this write the desired brightness level to the register OCR0B (p. 108): OCR0B\t= 63;                               // Set brightness to 25%You can edit this value at any time. To prevent glitches the value will be stored temporally and loaded to OCR0B when the cycle is completed (an overflow occurs).Get playing!:  I get it, a static brightness is boring as hell. To help you to get started I've included an advanced example below. The code uses both PWM channels to drive tow colors of an RGB LED, it gracefully combines both colors with a smooth and slow transition. It uses an interrupt triggered by Timer0 overflow. If enabled, an interrupt pauses the main code (in the main loop), executes a few lines of code, and the returns to the main code.

The design resembles an ordinary lamp, but the interior has been replaced by a matrix of ws2812 LEDs. The control is done by means of a Raspberry Pi, so that the whole can be programmed according to your own wishes. The lamp is about 12 inch (30 cm) high with a diameter of 4 inch (10 cm). The outside mainly consists of a glass cylinder.With more than 40 steps it has become quite a comprehensive Instructable. It starts with the design of the lamp. This covers both the 3D design in Fusion 360, and the electrical part. Extra attention is given to the power consumption of the LEDs. For example, a special board has been designed for power distribution.After the design the Instructable continues with the assembly of the various parts: The LED holder and the lamp foot. The LED holder contains 16 strips with 18 LEDs each, giving a total of 288 LEDs. The lamp base contains the Raspberry Pi, a small fan and additional electronic components.In addition to designing and building, the programming of the lamp is described. This starts with controlling the LEDs and retrieving weather data with Python. Followed by the different functions of the lamp.The primary function of this lamp is to display weather data. Due to the chosen design it is possible to use this lamp for other purposes. Like a clock or social media indicator (The Python code for an emergency light and lava lamp is included in this Instructable).", "title": "Weather/Matrix Lamp", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/WeatherMatrix-Lamp/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "About a year ago I made some Illuminated Christmas Tree Ornaments. These contained a web interface to alter the colors of the LEDs. In a later version, this web interface has been replaced by the usage of weather data. The color of the LEDs depend on the outside temperature, with all LEDs having the same color.Later I got the idea to make a 'thermometer'. By reading the actual, minimum and maximum temperature. All the LEDs would have different colors depending on these values. This has never been developed into a working prototype because I got another idea, which resulted in this LED matrix lamp. Where displaying weather data is only one of the possibilities.While making some sketches, I came up to the following functions:Display the current temperature.            Displaying the expected minimum and maximum temperatures.             Displaying the expected precipitation for the next hour (blue = rain, white = snow).             Displaying the current wind speed, and if possible direction.The drawings above are a first design of this lamp. The possibilities of this lamp are not limited to displaying weather data. Using a Raspberry PI gives many more possibilities. Such as a clock, a plasma or lava lamp, and several social media indicators.There are 2 ways to place the LEDs inside a Lamp: A square grid or a spiral of LEDs. The spiral version is easier to build. But the LEDs slope a little when using a spiral, and therefore looks less beautiful. Beside, the color gradient will be harder to program. That's why I've chosen to create a LED grid using ws2812 LED strips.The ws2812 LED strip is placed vertically through the lamp, in a zigzag pattern. All LED connections are at the top or bottom of the cylinder. This gives space inside the cylinder, for the other electronic components.Because the first idea was to display weather data, I have chosen for 16 LEDs per row. This allows for 16 wind directions:N            NNE            NE            ENE      E            ESE            SE            SSE            S     SSW            SW            WSW            W            WNW            NW            NNWThe previous project \"Christmas tree ornament\" has been based on a regular icosahedron, with a circular window for each LED.

It can get warmer or colder, but these are exceptions. The universal temperature colors are Red for hot, and Blue for cold. I've added a third color: Yellow. This gives more colors and makes the gradient more beautiful.The minimum and maximum temperatures change during the seasons. As a result, the temperature difference is never greater than 25 degrees. In other words, almost half of the entire color range.  To increase this range, a dynamic scale can be used. For example, the scale may depend on the month. The color blue can be 10 degrees Celsius in the summer, and -10 degrees Celsius in the winter.This scale should change slowly. For example:January    -10 to +15\nFebruary   -10 to +15\nMarch       -5 to +20\nApril       -5 to +20\nMay          0 to +25\nJune        +5 to +30\nJuly       +10 to +35\nAugust     +10 to +35\nSeptember   +5 to +30\nOctober      0 to +25\nNovember    -5 to +20\nDecember   -10 to +15The translation between temperature and color can be stored in a table.

The inner diameter must have enough room to hold all electronics. All this with the most efficient use of the LED strips.The following table shows the required diameter of the LEDs for different LED strips:LEDs/meter |LED distance|Length LEDs | LED Strip  | Required  | Distance\n           |            | (16 LEDs)  |  Diameter  | Diameter  |LEDs-Glass\n-----------+------------+------------+------------+-----------+-----------\n      30   |      3.3   |     53.3   |     17.0   |     9.2   |    -3.9\n      60   |      1.7   |     26.7   |      8.5   |     9.2   |     0.4\n      74   |      1.4   |     21.6   |      6.9   |     9.2   |     1.2\n      96   |      1.0   |     16.7   |      5.3   |     9.2   |     1.9\n     100   |      1.0   |     16.0   |      5.1   |     9.2   |     2.1distance and diameter in cmIt's not possible to use the 30 LEDs/meter strip for an evenly distributed LED placement. The best distance values are for the 60 and 74 LEDs/meter strips. These also provide enough room for the electronics.The glass's height is 26,5 cm (10,4 inch). This divided by the LED distance gives the number of LED rows. One thing to take into account is the sales length of the LED strips. Some are sold per meter. This makes it more efficient to use 4 pieces of 25 cm, instead of pieces of 26.5 cm.

That's why I opted for a strip of 74 LEDs per meter. The inner diameter of 70 mm also gives enough room for using a regular Raspberry Pi.The choice of the 74 LED/meter strip gives a diameter of about 7 centimeter (2,8 inch). The sketch (second image) determines all horizontal sizes for the final design. The previous step gave a rough calculation of the diameter. The following calculation is based on the specifications:16 LEDs x (5 mm + 8.78 mm) = 220.48 mm\n220.48 / pi = 70.18 mm (outer diameter)\n70.18 mm - 2.13 mm (thickness LED) = 68 mm (inner diameter)The sketch starts with two construction circles of 70 and 80 millimeter. Giving a maximum wall thickness of 10 mm. A rectangle of 5 x 2 mm is drawn on the inner circle. This represents the LED. A second rectangle of 12 x 2 mm is drawn near the first box. This gives a flat surface for the pcb-strip.A third circle, with a diameter of 20 mm, is placed outside the drawing. This circle goes through the outer corners of the LED, and gives a curved area around the LEDs. Measuring the location, of this circle, gives 45.5 mm from the center of the drawing.A final circle with a diameter 67 mm gives the inside markers for the LED strip.The 2 rectangles and the outher circle are copied 15 times in a circular pattern. With this sketch as result.It is possible to create this project with ws2812b pixel panels. These have a density of 1 LED/cm2. A total of 24 x 24 LEDs can be used inside this glass cylinder. A total of 576 LEDs, which doubles the resolution.I have chosen for the LED strips for various reasons: The panels are more expensive ($100 instead of $40) and require even more current (which gives more heat).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FDH/MJEF/J8KGWGDA/FDHMJEFJ8KGWGDA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1H/Z517/J8KGWO5H/F1HZ517J8KGWO5H.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 11: LEDs Choice"}, {"step": 12, "steps_text": "It takes only 18 steps to create this LED holder in Fusion 360.

The LED windows are made using a spere and an extracted rectangle of 5 x 5 mm. Both are copied (a total of 18) over a length of 227.4 mm. All these 18 windows are then copied (16 times 18) in a circular way. This is done in a single operation, resulting in 288 openings for the LEDs.Because the entire object can not be printed at once, it is divided into three parts.

The specified power usage is about 22 Watt/meter. This makes the total power usage 88 Watt. This is the maximum, with all LEDs at full brightness.The LEDs require a 5 Volt power source. And 88 Watt at 5 Volt results in a current of 17.6 Ampere. There are several 5 Volt power supplies available. For example: Power Source          | Current |  price  |  Size (lxbxh)\n----------------------+---------+---------+----------------\nMean Well LRS 50-5    |    10 A | \u20ac 15.00 | 100 x  80 x 30 \nMean Well LRS 75-5    |    15 A | \u20ac 22.00 | 100 x 100 x 30 \nMean Well LRS 150-5   |    26 A | \u20ac 30.00 | 200 x 100 x 40None of these power supplies fit inside the glass cylinder. The power supply is placed out of sight. The lamp is intended to display light effects. And will not be made to give maximum light output. The 75 Watt version is the closest to 88 Watt, and should give enough power for this project.The simplest method to limit power consumption is to limit the maximum brightness of all LEDs. By setting this to 50% the power consumption is limited to 9 Ampere. This makes it possible to use the 10 Ampere power source (this leaves 1 Amp for the Raspberry Pi).In order to limit the power consumption, I have developed a different software solution. With which it's possible that certain LEDs give more than 50% output.Each LED uses 0,3 Watt. This equals 60 mA at 5 Volt. This is the current for the maximum white light output. Each ws2812 LED contains 3 small LEDs (red, green and blue). And white light is made out of 3 colors: red, green and blue. And each individual color takes 20 mA.All LEDs (for this lamp) at a single output color (red, green or blue) takes 18 x 16 x 20 mA =  5.76 Ampere. The required current, for a single color, is below 9 Ampere. There is no need to maximize the LED output at 50% when using a single color for all LEDs. A current of 9 Ampere can power (9A / 20 mA) 450 colors (red, green or blue) at maximum output. But there are (288 x 3) 864 small LEDs which can use this current. The ws2812 LEDs are indiviually controlled by three values from 0 to 255. The value 0 equals off, the value 128 equals half power and 255 equals maximum output. And it takes 3 x 288 bytes to change all colors of all LEDs. The idea is to limit the sum of all output bytes to a certain value. And this value represents a current of 9 Ampere. If the output of all 864 bytes is more than this value, all output values are reduced. in the following example example is not enough power available for the requested output, and the ouput is reduced to 78%:9 Ampere divided by 20mA equals 450 colors at full brightness\nTotal maximum output equals: 450 (LEDs) x 255 (value) = 114,750\n\nHalf the LEDs (144) at full brightness (255) and half the LEDs full blue:\n144 x 255 (red) + 144 x 255 (green) + 144 x 255 (blue) = 110,160\n144 x   0 (red) + 144 x   0 (green) + 144 x 255 (blue) =  36,720 \n\nThe requested output (146,880) exceeds the maximum output (114,750)\nCorrection = 0.78 \n\nNew values:\n144 x 199 (red) + 144 x 199 (green) + 144 x 199 (blue) = 85,968 \n144 x   0 (red) + 144 x   0 (green) + 144 x 199 (blue) = 28,656", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FNP/9TTP/J8KGVH6Q/FNP9TTPJ8KGVH6Q.LARGE.jpg", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png"], "step_title": "Step 13: Power Supply"}, {"step": 14, "steps_text": "The following code implements limiting the current for the ws2812 LEDs.

The main loop reads 3 values and calls a fuction to alter the color of the LEDs. And after a second the main loop starts again.The setColor function adds all input RGB values multiplied by the number of LEDs. If this value exceeds a treshold (3 x 215 x 24, equals 1 Ampere) the output values are reduced by a factor. This way the output value always stays below 1 Ampere.The value of 3 x 215 doesn't allow all RGB values at a maximum output, but it allows 2 colors at maximum output.This method maximizes the output of the power supply.

There are 3 LEDs (Red, Green and Blue), resulting in a total of 54 mA/LED.The real maximum current per led equals 414 mA / 12 = 34.5 mA.Translated to 74 LEDs: 34.5 mA * 5 V * 74 LEDs = 12.7 Watt per meter.After receiving the ordered LEDs, I decided to measure the required current for one strings with 74 LEDs:Value (A)    |   64  |  128  |  192  |  255\n-------------+-------+-------+-------+-------\nsingle color | 0.246 | 0.507 | 0.729 | 0.954\ntwo colors   | 0.420 | 0.936 | 1.365 | 1.801\nWhite        | 0.590 | 1.346 | 1.979 | 2.617The required current per LED is almost the same for these LEDs as for the Adafruit NeoPixels.The maximum current per led equals 2.617 A / 74 = 35.4 mA.Translated to 2.617 * 5 V = 13 Watt per meter (for 74 LEDs, the lamp uses 4 x 72 LEDs).These values change the required power source, and there is no need to dimm the LEDs.The calculated power usage equals: 4 x 22 = 88 W, at 5 volt equals 88/5=17.6 A The measured power usage e/quals: 4 x 13 = 52 W, at 5 volt equals 52/5=10.4 AA 14 Ampere power supply should be able to provide full brightness for all LEDs, including power for the Raspberry Pi.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FPP/MF4M/J8UGZT2O/FPPMF4MJ8UGZT2O.LARGE.jpg", "/assets/img/pixel.png"], "step_title": "Step 15: Real Power Usage"}, {"step": 16, "steps_text": "The LEDs require a lot of current, as mentioned in a previous step.

Solder these wires on to the third solder island, in the direction of the LED strip.Then solder 8 signal wires (AWG24) at the bottom of the LED strips. These wires are about 5 cm (2 inches) long. First strip off a few mm on both sides. Solder the wires towards the LED strip.

I calculated the electrical part for 288 LEDs. It turned out that the real power consumption is lower than the specified power consumption. And I have adjusted the power supply accordingly.This lamp is still designed to give light at full output. There is enough power, the wires and fuses can handle the currents, and the fan keeps the temperature in control. I've provided enough detail to build this lamp with a smaller power supply. It's possible to use a 10 Amps power supply, or even a 5 Amps power supply. This allows for thinner wires, and less fuses. Even the fan can be omitted. The only drawback is that the LEDs can only light up at half power (or less). But the LEDs give enough light at low values (This lamp is not made to illuminate an entire room). Most images in this Instructable are taken at half of the regular output. Otherwise it was not possible to take pictures (first image).During the fastening of the LEDs the wires turned out to be quite stiff. This made it difficult to attach these wires to the PDB. This would probably have been easier, if the LED holder was divided in four or six parts. Divided horizontal for print size, and vertical for assembly.It's possible to replace the printed LED holder by a 60mm PVC tube. The LEDs have to be glued onto the tube, which alters the way of soldering. But the wiring diagram remains the same. This project can then probably be made without a 3D printer. All in all, this Instructable has become a bit longer than I had in mind. But I am very satisfied with the end result. Both the hardware part and the software part. The code will probably require some small changes in the future.

So if you like this project, please vote for it. Thanks.As you may know, I am a big fan of the Microchip 8-bit PIC controllers, see:http://www.microchip.com/design-centers/8-bitI use the JAL programming language since it looks like Pascal (which I also like). The JAL compiler and the libraries can be downloaded from:  http://www.justanotherlanguage.org/downloads  (scroll down for the latest released version).Normally I write all code myself as to completely understand what I am doing but for this project I needed to connect the PIC to the USB port of the PC and so I needed a JAL USB serial driver for this PIC controller. I used the USB serial driver in the JAL download package which seems to work fine. Since this USB serial driver was written for one specific PIC I used that PIC which is the PIC18F14K50. This controller has much more functionality than I need for this project, so I am currently in the process of getting this USB driver working on a simpler PIC version, the PIC16F1455, which is also cheaper.So what is this project all about? With the device mentioned in this Instructables you can send and receive Infra Red Remote Control commands from and to your PC via the USB port using the popular NEC Infra-Red protocol. In this way you can monitor Infra-Red commands and you can control any device that uses the NEC Infra-Red Remote Control protocol. The project decodes and translates Infra-Red messages into an address byte and a command byte or into a repeat message. The address is \u2013 of course \u2013 used to address a certain device like a TV or a Radio where the command byte indicates the function that needs to be performed like Volume Up, Volume Down. Next to decoding these messages, they can also be transmitted via Infra-Red using this device.", "title": "USB NEC Infra-Red Transmitter and Receiver", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/USB-NEC-Infra-Red-Transmitter-and-Receiver/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "A short introduction to this protocol. The NEC Infra Red Remote Control protocol is used in many devices and Remote Controls that you can buy. It modulates an Infra Red signal on a carrier of 38 kHz and uses pulse distance encoding for encoding a logical \u20181\u2019 and a logical \u20180\u2019. The protocol uses a simple check to see if the message is OK by sending both the address and the command byte and an inverted version of both in one and the same message and checking if they are the same after reception. When a button is pressed on the Remote Control it sends a complete Infra Red message with address and command once. Keeping the button pressed will result in sending a shorter repeat message without address and command information.

It was written in JAL. The Intel Hex file for programming your PIC is attached. The software performs the following functions:Decoding NEC Infra-Red messages and send it to the PC via USB. The message is decoded from the bit stream that is generated by the Infra-Red receiver and translated to an address + command message or a repeat message.Sending NEC Infra Red messages received from the PC via USB. Note that the software also creates the 38 kHz carrier frequency which directly drives the Infra-Red LEDs. In parallel to the Infra-Red LED an Amber LED is connected as to make the transmission of a message visible.By default this circuit will mute the Infra-Red receiver during transmission of an Infra-Red message. If a jumper is  placed on the \u2018Unmute\u2019 position, it will disable this mute function. In that case the transmitted Infra-Red message will also be decoded in parallel to the transmission and after complete reception it is sent as a received Infra-Red message to the PC. If a valid NEC Infra-Red message is received, the Red \u2018IR OK\u2019 LED will light up. In order to operate this device you need to have a Terminal Emulator program on your PC. I used \u2018Termite\u2019 for this purpose. When the device is connected to the PC, it will automatically be recognized as an additional COM port by Windows 10 since there seems to be a Microchip driver for this device in Windows 10 pre-installed. The setting for this COM port should be: 19200 baud 8 bits, 1 stop-bit, no parity and using RTS/CTS flow control. The baud rate can be set to any other value if needed so a baud rate of 115200 will also work. Once the device is configures via the USB port by connecting to it via the Terminal Emulator program, the Green \u2018Configured\u2019 LED will light up.Receiving Infra-Red messagesWhen an Infra-Red message is received, the following will be displayed in the Terminal Emulator program:\u2018A:xx C:xx\u2019 in case of a complete message, where xx is the hexadecimal number of the address (A) and command (C). Values for both can range from 0x00 (0) to 0xFF (255).\u2018Repeat\u2019 in case of a repeat message.Sending Infra-Red messagesFor this I needed to define a protocol that tells the device what to do. Since we use a Terminal Emulator I used ASCII characters to define a message. The protocol to send a command to the device uses the following format: \u2018!AACCRR#\u2019, where (all characters are case insensitive):\u2018!\u2019 indicates the start of the message.\u2018AA\u2019 is the value of the address in hexadecimal notation so \u20180\u2019 to \u20189\u2019 and \u2018A\u2019 to \u2018F\u2019, \u2018CC\u2019 is the value of the command in hexadecimal notation so \u20180\u2019 to \u20189\u2019 and \u2018A\u2019 to \u2018F\u2019\u2018RR\u2019 is the number of repeat message that need to be transmitted in hexadecimal notation so \u20180\u2019 to \u20189\u2019 and \u2018A\u2019 to \u2018F\u2019. A value of \u201800\u2019 means no repeat message is sent.An example of a message with address 0x07, command 0x05 and 3 repeats should then be typed as follows on the Terminal Emulator program: !070503#The device has different responses after a command is sent from the PC:\u2018Y\u2019 means that a message was transmitted. Note that this response is given after all messages - including all repeats - are transmitted so it might take some time before this response is given when many repeat messages need to be transmitted.\u2018N\u2019 means that there was an illegal character in the message sent to the PC.\u2018B\u2019 means that an Infra-Red transmission was still busy when the command was given.?\u2019 means that the device was expecting \u2018!\u2019 but it received something else.", "step_imgs": ["/assets/img/pixel.png"], "step_title": "Step 3: The Software and the Operation of the Device"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "I made a short video of the device in action.

The resistor value changes because the voltage drop across the shorter wavelength LEDs is higher than for the longer wavelength LEDs. R4 is a 2W resistor. It will get quite warm during operation so be sure to mount the resistors clear of the controller board, keeping the leads long enough so that the resistor body is at least 5mm clear of the board.The Infineon devices are available cheaply on eBay and are also stocked by suppliers such as Mouser.

I am not including a detailed layout because the board design I ended up with got a bit untidy due to having to add components like the snubber network that I had not originally planned. The top of the board, shown above partially built, has the power resistors and the socket for the Raspberry Pi. I used a right angle header for the Pi so it sits at right angles to the main board but if you use a normal straight header then it will simply sit parallel to the board instead. It will occupy a little more room that way so plan accordingly.Veropins were used to connect wires to the board. To cut tracks a small twist drill bit is useful. For the Pi socket use a sharp craft knife to cut the tracks as you don't have a spare hole between the two sets of socket pins.Note the double row of 1mm copper wire. This is to provide a low impedance path for the nearly 7 amps of current that the LEDs consume at full power. These wires go to the source terminals of the power MOSFETs and thence to ground.There is only a small 5V wire on this board supplying power to the Pi. This is because the 5V main power feed goes to the anodes of the LEDs, which are connected via a standard PC IDE disk cable on a second board in my prototype. However you don't need to do this and can just wire them up directly to a socket on the first board.

On the heatsinks shown, at full power, the heatsink temperature reaches 50 degrees C and so these heatsinks are probably slightly smaller than optimal. In hindsight it would probably also have been a good idea to put three of the longer wavelength LEDs on each heatsink rather than put all six of the shorter wavelength emitters on one and the longer wavelength emitters on the other. This is because, for a given forward current, the short wavelength emitters dissipate more power due to their higher forward voltage drop, and hence get warmer.You could of course add fan cooling.

The 3d printed fibre adaptor fits snugly over the LED assembly and guides the fibre. The strain relief block is mounted approximately 65mm in front of the LED heatsinks. This provides enough room to get your fingers in and push the fibre adaptors onto the LEDs and then fit the fibre.Drill 4mm holes through the strain relief block in line with the LEDs.Each length of fibre is approximately 250mm long, However because each fibre takes a different path, the actual fitted length will vary. The easiest way to get this right is to cut fibre lengths of 300mm. You must then straighten the fibre or it will be impossible to manage. It's like 3mm thick perspex rod, and is much stiffer than you imagine.To straighten the fibre, I used a 300mm length (approx) of 4mm OD brass rod. The inside diameter of the rod is sufficient for the fibre to slide smoothly into the rod. Ensure both ends of the rod are smooth, so you don't scratch the fibre while sliding it in and out of the rod.Push the fibre into the rod so that it is flush at one end and with a little length sticking out the other, or all the way in if the rod is longer than the fibre. Then dip the rod into a deep saucepan filled with boiling water for about 15 seconds. Remove the rod and reposition the fibre if necessary so that the other end is flush with the rod end, then heat that end in the same way. You should now have a perfectly straight piece of fibre. Remove by pushing another piece of fibre through until you can grip and remove the straightened fibre.When you have straightened all twelve pieces of fibre, cut a further twelve pieces approx 70mm long. These will be used to guide the fibres through the coupling plate. Then when construction is complete, they will be used to populate the individual fibre out coupler, so they are not wasted. Straighten these cut pieces in the same way. Then fit them to the coupler plate. You can see how they should look in the photo above. The staggered layout is to minimise the area occupied by the fibres (minimal spherical packing density). This ensures that the fibre combiner can operate as efficiently as possible.Take each full length piece of cut fibre and sand one end flat, working up to 800 and then 1500 grit sandpaper. Then polish with metal or plastic polish - a small rotary tool with a polishing pad is handy here.Now remove ONE cut fibre and slide the full length fibre into the coupler plate. Then fit it back through the strain relief so that the polished end is touching the LED lens front via the LED fibre coupler. Repeat for each fibre. Keeping the short pieces of fibre in the holes makes sure each long fibre is easy to get in exactly the right place.NOTE: Don't push too hard on the violet and ultraviolet LEDs They are encapsulated with a soft polymer material unlike the other LEDs, which are epoxy encapsulated. It's easy to deform the lens and cause the bonding wires to break. Trust me, I learned this the hard way. So be gentle when fitting the fibres to these two LEDs.It doesn't much matter what order you route the fibres through the coupler but try and layer the fibres so that they don't cross over each other. In my design the bottom six LEDs were routed to the lowest three holes for the left three LEDs and then the next three holes for the right three LEDs and so forth.When you have all the fibres routed through the coupler, position it on the base board and drill two mounting holes, then screw it down. Then, using a very sharp pair of diagonal cutters, cut each piece of fibre as close to the coupler face as possible.

Cut the rod to approximately 73mm and sand and polish both ends. Then fix the jig to two opposite sides of the rod using double sided adhesive tape. Sand using 40 grit paper until you are within 0.5mm or so of the jig lines, then progressively increase to 80,160,400,800,1500,3000,5000 and finally 7000 grit paper to get a tapered polished surface. Then remove the jig and reposition to sand the other two sides. You should now have a tapered pyramid suitable for mounting in the fibre combiner plate. The narrow end is 6mm x 6mm to match the fibre takeoff.Note: in my case I didn't quite sand down to 6mm x 6mm so the combiner sticks out a bit from the mounting plate. This doesn't matter as the 6mm fibre is a press fit and will butt with the narrow end of the combiner if pushed in far enough.Strip back about 1 inch of the outer jacket from the 6mm fibre, taking care not to damage the fibre itself. Then, if the outer jacket of the fibre isn't a snug enough fit into the coupler plate, just wrap a piece of tape round it. It should then be able to be pushed in and snugly bed with the combiner pyramid. Mount the whole assembly to the baseplate in line with the fibre outputs.Note that you do lose some light when combining. You can see the reason from the optical traces above, because concentrating the light down also causes the beam angle to increase and we lose some light in the process.

However availability of LEDs in other wavelengths is likely to be a challenge. You can get 365nm UV LEDs cheaply but the flexible fibre 6mm cable starts to absorb strongly even at 390nm. However I did find that individual fibres would work with that wavelength, so if you wanted, you could add or replace a LED to give you a shorter UV wavelength. Another possibility is to increase brightness by doubling up on the LEDs. You could, for example, design and print a 5 X 5 fibre coupler (or 4 X 6) and have 2 LEDs per channel. Note that you'd need a much larger power supply as you'll be drawing nearly 20 amps. Each LED needs its own dropping resistor; don't parallel the LEDs directly. The MOSFETs have more than enough capacity to drive two or even several LEDs per channel.You can't really use higher power LEDs because they don't emit light from a small area like the 3W LEDs and so you can't efficiently fibre couple them. Look up 'conservation of etendue' to understand why this is.The light loss through the combiner is quite high. This is unfortunately a consequence of the laws of physics. In reducing the beam radius we also increase its divergence angle and so some light escapes because the light guide and fibre only have an acceptance angle around 45 degrees.

LEDs glow by arduino's digital o/p pins via  transistor module. Let's see it in next step. That's all about sensor modules.RGB circuit -  Second part is of indication, decoration purpose that I used rgb led's. I think you may know about MAX 7219 ic, if not then it is used for led matrix, multiple 7 segment displays as driver & uses only 3 arduino pins. I used this ic because - 1) Limited no. of arduino o/p pins 2) Code & connections are simple 3) easy to use . This ic is the most costly component in whole project. Matrix - Third and last part is display module (Matrix). I made one 8 X 8 led matrix (As we are already using much LED's then why to buy separate led matrix display.) So made one matrix of 64 LED's.

How It Works !!!"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Now I think you had understood the overall circuit and LED working as a sensor.Now Let's see How LED (Sensor panel) is acting as input as well as output.To measure voltage generated by LED, we are connecting LED's +ve terminal (Anode) to the arduino's analog input pin. And another -ve terminal (Cathode) to the common ground. This is how arduino measures the voltage. But while testing this, I found that my readings are floating. (you can search on google - Arduino floating problem). So I connected one resistor of about 1 Mega Ohm (R3) in between arduino's analog pin and ground. Now to lit the LEDs, we need to power these LEDs. For that I connected one switching transistor 2N2222 as shown in figure. It's Base is connected to the arduino's digital output pin. When it is HIGH transistor will give 5V supply to LED panel. To limit supply current to LEDs , connected 220 Ohm resistor to each LED. (Each - because there will not be problem if one LED take more current and another less) So the each LED will take same current of about 11mA. Also to limit digital pin supply of arduino, connected 220 Ohm resistor (R1) in series between base and digital pin. IS THIS SAFE TO GIVE HIGH CURRENT AT ARDUINO'S ANALOG I/P PIN ???The answer is YES but...ANALOG I/P PINS SHOULD BE SET TO INPUT ONLY AT ALL CONDITIONSIf you give high current to analog input pin to read, though it will take only few nano Ampere current. Because is has high impedance(resistance). But as i said, that pin should be set for input only. If you set it for output it will supply large current. But arduino can only supply 40mA current per pin. So your arduino will be damaged. If accidentally pin is set as output, then to limit current I connected 220Ohm resistor (R2). But I had not taken any risk and tested it. Also I don't know what will happen due to reverse flow of current. So better way keep analog pins to input only.Reference - http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php/topic,21010.0.ht...", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWH/BWJ4/ILGXM3IQ/FWHBWJ4ILGXM3IQ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: LED (Sensor) Input As Well As Output"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Sensor panel is nothing but pattern of LEDs connected in parallel.

Simply - sensitivity towards laser beam So in this projects I tried many no. of patterns, to give more sensitivity towards laser, to increase sensor panel size & mainly to reduce no. of LEDs per panel. Also there should be minimum void between LEDs, so that you will not miss any shot. One more thing to consider - How much is the distance between laser gun and targets.I choose 3-2-3-2-3 LED pattern consisting of 13 LEDs for our project.

There are many tutorials on powering LEDs and including them in different light installations. But there is only very little information on how to control or shape the light that is emitted by LEDs.LEDs are a light source that emits light from a very small point in every direction evenly. Depending on the type of LED and how it is built the light is often directed in a wide cone. High power LEDs or SMD LEDs like the WS2812b or APA102 usually have a beam angle of 120\u00b0-140\u00b0, 5mm LEDs can have a beam angle of up to 180\u00b0. This means that over the whole angle of this beam the same amount of light is emitted. But since we have a single point of origin if we shine the light of an LED on a flat surface we get a light spot that is brightest in the middle and looses brightness the further away you go from the center.In light installations and in photography (a field I have much interest in) you strife for a more homogeneous distribution of light. The key to this is diffusion of the light.

These LEDs also usually have a beam angle of 120\u00b0, which result in a pattern like you can see in the sketch.These strips are often used because only a short distance away from the strip the beams of each LED overlap so much that they merge into a bar of light.

Lets remember this values and take a look at the next.The third one has a similar aluminium profile as the second one but uses a round profile for the diffuser. This places the highest point of the diffuser around 17mm away from the LEDs.

If you use this in a long exposure and move it through the view of a camera as shown in the second photo you can see that there is a difference between bare LEDs and then one in the strip, but the spots where the LEDs are create bright lines.The third photo shows a LED strip put halfway in the extrusion with a depth of 17mm. The light is distributes much better and you can barely see where the individual LEDs are any more.

With a distance of 17mm from the LEDs we already get a good result, but it can still be improved. Lets remember that an LED is a single point shaped source of light that spreads its light evenly on every direction. The diffuser is a flat surface, so we have to look at the angle and intensity of the light. The further away we get from the light source the less bright the light will be.If you look at the first photo you can see that at a distance of 30mm a beam angle of 120\u00b0 spreads the light over more then 100mm. But since the light has to travel much further at the border of this cone the light is a lot dimmer then in the middle.What we are looking for is the same altitude to area covered ration. If we shine the light on a flat surface and the distance from the light to the surface is more or less equal we have a more even distribution of light. This can either be achieved by making the diffuser a sphere with the light source at its center or we can look for another angle to to the math with.If you calculate it you will get an angle of about 53,13\u00b0 at which the altitude of a triangle equals the length of the segment opposite of the angle. To make it a little bit easier lets take an angle of 60\u00b0. In the second sketch you can see the result if we apply the 60\u00b0 angle. The spot of a 60\u00b0 cone has roughly the same brightness if you look at it or capture it with a camera. Applying this to the diffuser with 17mm depth we can see that this was designed quite well.What all this tells us is that if you want to create your own diffuser place it at the same distance away from the LEDs as the LEDs are away from each other. That way you will get quite good results already.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F4Q/RGVU/JAVCRCA3/F4QRGVUJAVCRCA3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZO/IKV3/JAVCRC9O/FZOIKV3JAVCRC9O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYF/VUFG/JAVCRC9L/FYFVUFGJAVCRC9L.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: The Math III"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Since I was not happy with the results so far I was looking for a way to get an even better spread of light.So lets think about the difference between directed light and diffused light. The main difference that is of importance here is that with a directed light we have straight lines of light going away from a single spot. So the further away we go from this one spot the less light we will get. Projecting it on a flat surface we will always get a brightness falloff. Diffused light means that we don't have a single source of light, but a large one. And also that the light spreads from each point of this large light source in every direction. A diffuser is a device that transforms a direct light into a diffused light, so the diffuser essentially becomes a new light source that this time is not just a single spot.Now if we take this light source, that still has some hot spots and diffuse it a second time, we will get a completely homogeneous distribution. The first layer of diffusion has hot spots, that is true, but only a little distance away from these the light from all the points in this hot spot overlap so much that it is not visible any more. The only downside is that to diffuse a light we have to use a material that is a little bit opaque so it reduces the intensity of the light. With a double diffusion we reduce the intensity even more, but in the applications where this is important this is not that important.A very simple and effective way to create a double diffusion is to place some wadding between the LED strip and the diffuser. In the photos you can see the result of some wadding put into the 10mm deep and the 17mm deep aluminium extrusion. As you can see the 10mm one improves and the 17mm one gets nearly perfect to work with.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FDB/YDHT/JAVCRC7Q/FDBYDHTJAVCRC7Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH6/H4EW/JAVCRC7R/FH6H4EWJAVCRC7R.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3F/SFYS/JAVCRC7S/F3FSFYSJAVCRC7S.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYK/LQ0M/JAWTV944/FYKLQ0MJAWTV944.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Improving the Results - Double Diffusion!"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "Another solution is also to increase the distance from the LED to the diffuser. If you think back a few steps with an altitude of the distance between each LED you will get an area covered that is equal to the distance between the LEDs. But if you increase the distance these light cones overlap even more and will result in the hot spots overlapping so much that the merge into each other.

In some cases a single point of light is desired, but most of the time you want a more pleasing look, and a diffused light source will get you this. If you work in cinematography or photography you should already know a lot about direct vs. diffused light and here you get some insight on how to turn one into another.If you want to do a more professional double diffusion you can use sheets of acrylic. There are acrylic sheets with a light transmission of 79%, these are usually used in bathroom installation as a privacy protection. These have a good opacity to be used as a diffuser if you double it. For a double diffusion the full distance between each LED is not needed. Place the first layer of diffusion around 1/3 of the distance between the LED and the second layer at 2/3 of the distance. This way you will get a very even light distribution on the second layer. But you can also simply use distance between LEDs and place first level in the middle of it.There are many more ways to achieve this like using acrylic light channeling but those are more complex and it is usually easier to use either single diffusion with enough distance or double diffusion.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 8: Conclusion"}], "channel": "LEDs"}, {"category": "technology", "description": "3D print + LED = awesomenessHere I'll show you how to make a little LED lamp from any 3D print you likeThis is the easiest way I could think of and it requires just a LED and a button cell batteryThe result is a mood light which you can turn on/off by turning, which allows for the LED to make contact with the battery", "title": "Light 'em Up: Turn Any 3D Print Into a LED Lamp", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Light-em-Up-Turn-Any-3D-Print-Into-a-LED-Lamp/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "- 3D printer or access to one- Transparant filament, I use natural PETG- 1 button cell battery3v CR2032- 1 standard 5mm LED, get the bright ones- Meshmixer software if you want to turn your own print into a LED lamp", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FIN/K1B1/IYOQT9FK/FINK1B1IYOQT9FK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: What You'll Need"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Our 3D light will exist out of 2 parts: the threaded base with battery + the transparant print with threaded cut-out and LEDThe base you can print in any material and doesn't need supportIf you want to convert an existing print to fit the base you first need to do a boolean difference with the 'Cut out' file in the (free) meshmixer software (works with STL files)I added a short video that shows how to do thisOr you can use the prints I already prepared from Thingverse uploads (original files: Skull head, Pop Buddha, Chameleon)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F37/YM0V/IYOQUGU3/F37YM0VIYOQUGU3.LARGE.jpg", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png"], "step_title": "Step 2: Prepare the Print"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "I printed the base in white PLA without support and 20% infillFor the transparant part I suggest natural PETG and 15% infill (less infill is more light coming through)There is no need for support to print the threaded Cut-out, but it might be needed for other overhangs in your print", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FN5/I463/IYOQUEAD/FN5I463IYOQUEAD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8Z/DV8R/IYOQUEAQ/F8ZDV8RIYOQUEAQ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Print"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "The battery snaps on the base, make sure to put the negative side upwardsBefore you snap the LED into the print, coil up the negative wire (the shortest wire) with a pencilFit the LED and bend the positive wire so it touches the side of the print right underneath the thread, or possibly a little bit inside the thread.

Let me show you how I turned my old (and still in use) 3D printer into a tiny G-Code controlled artist!The concept is very easy: Get your machine to position a RGB LED on programmed coordinates and display single colorful pixels to produce one total picture on a camera set on long exposure photography. Also the premise is to use a preexisting system that can afterwards still be used in its original manner without interference. An Upgrade! Many systems nowadays offer swappable tool heads. But I've never seen a LED tool head. Why? Well, with this instructable you can make your own! (Have you ever seen a LED tool head? Let me know in the comments!)How does it work?CNC machines are programmed by G-Code. To put simply, it is a text file that contain coordinates, speeds, tools and other settings that are interpreted by the machine to movements along different axis.

This is because of several reasons:The three separate LEDs in the package produce light at different intensities as stated in the datasheet even if the LEDs would be perfectly balanced, the human eye isn't. The sensitivity towards light is not constant along the complete range of the wavelength of visible light. It depends on the physical properties of the cone cells in the retina.  even if the human factor would be considered by the - at this point extremely thorough - RGB LED manufacturer, the CMOS sensor of my camera also has a different sensitivity spectrum compared to my eyes. What seems white to me, will always be - ever so slightly - differently colored to a machines perception.  arguably you could also say that for the difference in perception between two humans as well!even if all this factory would miraculously be taken into account and if I had a RGB LED that was specifically made for my eyes, my camera and this instructable. Temperature influences the generated wavelengths of LEDs. So this whole setup would need to be placed inside a room that would meticulously be kept at a constant temperature. Check out this cool video!In my case though: It looks kinda white, so that's good enough for me...Furthermore, the output brightness of any LED is never completely linear compared to the input signal This means that mixing them at different values can lead to different colors.

Well now its a reality. So now I wanted to take out a single Pixel out from the display, and change it color anywhere in the world. Once I have made this I will be able to control its color by lots of tools and devices. So Let's make this thing and get it connected to the internet (Internet of Things).To make vibrant colors I used 5050 RGB SMD LEDs for better color blending. So if you don't have it no worries, use normal 5mm RGB LEDs or separate R G B LEDs with proper diffuser, Even at my place its hard to find RGB SMD led so I savaged it from LED Strip.

So we will be using MQTT Protocol for this, for those who don't know what MQTT is i will explain in simple terms. You have to know about three things Publisher (One who gives in data ,here its color), Subscriber (One who listens to data) and Broker (Manages data from Publisher to Subscriber). Next thing you need to know is \"Topic\" its like channel on TV so if we subscribe to a certain channel we receives programs regarding to that channel, while considering publisher I am sending data related to that topic. So our pixel will be continuously listening to a topic for color in hex format like #RRGGBB. as soon as the controller gets it, it split the data into Red Green and Blue components. and generate PWM.For beginner I recommend  to use io.adafruit.com it has dashboard and color picker :) . Their are lots of brokers available,once you feel confident try them. To test this you can use MQTT Dashboard Android App ,IFTTT supports adafruit IO as well. Once everything is working you can integrate it with Alexa , Facebook, Twitter possibility is endless.How does the circuit work?Its so simple! PWM (Pulse Width Modulation is a technique for getting analog results with digital means.) but the GPIO pins on ESP8266 can't provide sufficient current to drive all the LEDs. So we called in some guys called transistor for help. Transistor multiplies current what we provide to one of its terminal (base). so if we connect LED to transistor it will allow led to draw higher current depending on PWM signal. So by varying PWM duty cycle we are also controlling brightness of LED thus we can achieve vibrant colors depending on ratio of mixture.In the PCB which am gonna make consist of auto reset circuit for ESP8266 which is inbuilt in NodeMCU along with voltage regulator. So if you are using NodeMCU just connect common anode RGB led strip to ULN2003 or ULN2803 and interconnect it. For more brightness you might want to tinker with the collector resistance but if you are using LED strip then you don't need to worry about it.

Such as those caused by the refraction of light from heat waves or acoustic pressure waves in air, neither of which we can see under \"normal\" conditions.The basic phenomena you are seeing when looking at a schlieren image or video is light being refracted by the difference in air density caused by a variety of means. With a dash of science, we can amplify the effect of this refraction. The small change in the path of the light causes it to not fall on the camera, resulting in a dark area, or vice versa. Three common physical processes we encounter every day, usually without realizing it, that modify air density relative to neighboring air are:heating or cooling itsound traveling through itintroducing other gasses to the \"air\"Above are a couple drawings roughly demonstrating what we are doing to accomplish the visualization of these phenomena.

To see weaker levels of refraction we need a very fine point of light. This is easy to accomplish by just covering the LED with something that blocks light and has a small hole in it. With a smaller light source, a smaller amount of refraction reduces the total light going into the camera by a greater percentage than if there was a larger light source. (This is the same reason shadows from smaller light sources are sharper than those from larger ones.)I've shown a few different methods to make a pinhole cover for the LED.Black electrical tape punched with pencil lead or something similar.Foil surrounded by electrical tape with a window cut out. The foil creates a sharper and smaller pin hole.Foil tape. Easiest method.When using foil color the front of it with a black marker after punching the hole. This ensures a sharper, high contrast light source especially if there is light is reflecting off a source in front of the phone.You can also experiment with a colored film over the LED to create different looks and in some cases even highlight specific features.Another interesting thing to experiment with is the placement of the pinhole filter over the LED. There are multiple LED's in the iPhone's \"flash\", each has a different color temperature. Depending on where you place your pinhole you will see a different colored light source.

The mirror I am using has a focal length of 1300mm so 1300mm x 2 = 2600mm = about 102 inches.The face of the mirror and phone need to be as parallel as possible to reduce lensing artifacts. Adjustments should be made in any direction except for throwing off these parallel planes. If you know your mirror is level you can use the compass/level app to level the phone.Open the Camera App or whatever photography app you are using. Some apps give better control over focus, exposure, LED light level, etc and can be a big help but the default camera app will work fine.Turn on the flash (LED). If you have your tripod close to the correct spot you may already see the focused point of light on or near the front of the phone. If not it helps to get a sheet of white paper and turn the lights down to find it. Here you are just trying to rough in the location of the spot by moving the tripod in all directions, keeping in mind the parallel plane we are trying to preserve.Once you have a sharply focused point of light on the face of the phone on or very near the camera you can switch to the fine adjustment if you are using an XY translation table or something similar. Dial in the spot so it is centered on the camera lens.You should now be able to see an overexposed whitish light in the mirror. If there are lobes protruding from the edges of the mirror do your best to make adjustments to center the light within the mirror. If you have lens flare effects off to the side of the mirror your phone and mirror planes are not parallel. It will still work if you don't do this but I have experienced better end results with near perfect alignment.Once your point light source, mirror and camera are aligned you can begin to adjust the focus and exposure to start seeing Schlieren. Rising heat from a small tea light candle is a good subject to use when trying this for the first time. It is generally easy to see the Schlieren effect from this type of subject even if almost everything is going wrong.Use focus lock - holding your finger down on a location to lock the focus and exposure level. Then scroll up or down next to the focus box to change the exposure level. It may take a few tries to get the focus to lock where you want it and the exposure level at the same time.Once you are comfortable using focus lock and are able to get nice clear images of the heat rising off the candle by adjusting the exposure level and tweaking camera position you can move on to subjects that are more difficult to see such as the acoustic fields generated by TinyLev.The subject being observed should be as close to the mirror as possible, be careful with flame sources such as the candle obviously. This will increase the amount of divergence from refraction that the light undergoes before reaching the camera thus increasing the visible Schlieren effect.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F3N/7R7L/J8QGD66E/F3N7R7LJ8QGD66E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNR/C92A/J8QGD6PR/FNRC92AJ8QGD6PR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGM/P8MO/J8QGDEZ7/FGMP8MOJ8QGDEZ7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDB/E3E7/J8QGDF02/FDBE3E7J8QGDF02.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGI/LYC6/J8QGDF9U/FGILYC6J8QGDF9U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTO/LRMT/J8QGD7GQ/FTOLRMTJ8QGD7GQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFY/VZB5/J8QGDF9R/FFYVZB5J8QGDF9R.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU4/86PA/J8QGDF38/FU486PAJ8QGDF38.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNO/8FQ9/J8QGD7ER/FNO8FQ9J8QGD7ER.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBI/JODG/J8QGD7CT/FBIJODGJ8QGD7CT.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Setup"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Conditions at the time and location of testing were approximately:50 feet above sea level72 degrees Fahrenheit25% relative humidityI have experimented with adding a razor to cut out additional light at the focal point in front of the camera lens as well as using add-on telephoto lenses to provide greater zoom.

However, proceed with caution as it seems that not all RGB light bulbs are the same despite the same functionality and identical looking remotes.For the glass ornament shown above, a simple holder was made for an RGB PCB module extracted from the light bulb such that it illuminates up through the base of the ornament, when powered from a 12V DC supply.  The frosted/etched finish on the glass diffuses the light to give a nice effect and the colour can be changed, within the limits of the basic RGB module, using the supplied remote unit.The holder was cut from acrylic sheet using a small hobby CNC that I had the use of, although you can get a much better edge finish without sanding if you have access to a laser cutter.  If you are good with hand tools you should be able to produce similar designs.  If you have access to a 3D printer with transparent filament then you can create many different variants.", "title": "Remote Controlled RGB Decorative Lighting Puck", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Remote-Controlled-RGB-Decorative-Lighting-Puck/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The most important part you will need is a suitable RGB light bulb.  The one I used here is the PRO-ELEC  LMP-G60E27RGB03-02B  3W LED E27 RC RGB Colour Changing Lamp bought from CPC Farnell for an amazingly low price of \u00a34.86.  I say amazingly because the same part seems to be offered for much more than this from the usual eBay cheap sellers and also a lot of Chinese sellers.  Even our local home supplies store has similar ones for less than \u00a38 so perhaps there is over supply on the market and prices might be about to tumble.Most of the cheap RGB lightbulbs are quoted as 3W and require some form of thermal management because most of the power is concentrated into one small component.  My preference was to reduce the power dissipation rather than have to provide thermal management. This particular lamp is actually driven from an internal 230V mains AC to 19V DC power supply and the main RGB module uses an on board 78L05 voltage regulator for the control IC.  This means that the supply voltage can be lowered to reduce the heat dissipation from the individual LEDs and provide a reasonable level of brightness whilst still powering the control IC at 5V DC.I found that powering the main RGB module using 12V DC consumed about 32mA (less than a third of the overall current when using 19V) and gave a perfectly adequate brightness with barely any heat dissipation.  You can run this back up to 19V DC if you wish to do so but beware of the increase in power dissipation.  Also, unless you really know what you are doing and can ensure adequate isolation, DO NOT use the power supply from the light bulb as it is a non-isolated design will have mains and rectified mains voltages all over it.Also, it is not worth trying to run the module from anything much lower than 12V DC since the RGB LED seems to use multiple series LED chips giving a forward voltage of between 7 and 8 volts DC.Running at the lower voltage does slightly alter the current ration between each LED colour resulting in a slightly colder looking white.  If you really wanted to I am sure you could correct this by placing the appropriate value chip resistor on top of the ones already there but that seems like to much trouble for something that will never be great. Anyway, this actually seemed to make the glass ornament look slightly more antique.The Infra Red remote control sensitivity seems quite good but the rendering and granularity of the available colours is not great.  In general, as light bulbs go, these RGB versions are not much good as the control of brightness is only 5 hardly noticeable levels and the strobe and flash modes I find annoying.  However, it does have some good re-use potential with an example presented in this instructable.Using Other RGB LampsThere are a number of similar looking bulbs to the PRO-ELEC part, as well as different form factors, along with identical looking remotes.  However, it is difficult to tell what is inside these lamps by just looking at them as you would think that they are all the same design below the skin.  I did pull apart a different LED spotlight that was called 'MAGIC LIGHTING'.  It was less than \u00a34 delivered from China.  The central LED got quite hot but the PSU was 5V DC and having no internal regulator, unlike the PRO-ELEC part.  This makes it more difficult to drop the power on the LEDs without putting in higher value chip resistors or delicately soldering some axial ones in place.  Also, the power supply had a third wire which supplied a 50Hz clocking signal to the control chip so you couldn't just use a standard 5V supply.  This design did seem to be isolated but I would not guarantee them all to be like that.  This PSU also got quite warm when running at full white brightness.When power is first applied to the PRO-ELEC part, the control IC defaults to a mid power white light.  The Magic Lighting part defaults to a rather more garish flashing of colours through the entire 16 colours.Even though the remote controls looked identical, there was no interoperability between them.The Veezio RGB lamp pictured above was found in a local B&Q store and some of the bulbs were on clearance at \u00a34.  These parts did have a distinctly different remote.  Most of the components could be seen, whilst still packaged, on the PCB under the clear lens but it did not look like a voltage regulator was present and so is probably all 5V DC.  The LED chip resistors looked relatively easy to modify though if you wanted to drop the power consumption by adding some more series resistance.  Without buying one and taking the top off, it is not possible to determine if the PSU in the body is isolated but I would always assume that they are not.The real take away here is that there are some parts that are easier to re-use than others and you do need to procure the same types if you want interoperability from one remote.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F97/7NY1/IT22SSGS/F977NY1IT22SSGS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMO/TSR4/ITKJ1UJ6/FMOTSR4ITKJ1UJ6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNI/HFQB/ITKJ1TLT/FNIHFQBITKJ1TLT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQC/EXZN/ITKJ1VRA/FQCEXZNITKJ1VRA.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Selecting Your Donor Light Bulb"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Parts and Materials RequiredRGB LED Lightbulb (see previous step about variants) PRO-ELEC LMP-G60E27RGB03-02B 3W LED E27 RC RGB Colour Changing Lamp used in this instructable       12VDC @ 500mA Power Supply (the lightbulb I used drew about 32mA but there is no cost advantage in getting a lower power version but you might want to power multiple pucks)       DC barrel line socket to suit DC  power supply (optional - you can just cut off the PSU DC barrel connector and solder the wires directly to the PCB)       Connecting cable (optional - if you choose to have a connector between the Puck and PSU)       Acrylic (Perspex or Plexiglass) sheet colour to suit taste (I used 3mm black and clear but this depends on your final design)        Glue (the proper glue is expensive so I used some Evo-Stick PVC & ABS glue which seems to do the job if the surfaces are flat enough)       3 x felt pads for the baseTools RequiredBasic hand tools such as pliers, cutters, strippers and screwdrivers       Soldering Iron       Access to a small CNC router and/or Laser Cutter would be ideal", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8S/6UGW/IT22TNNO/F8S6UGWIT22TNNO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC4/NDHO/IT22TNPW/FC4NDHOIT22TNPW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1S/VYZT/ITCHJNE9/F1SVYZTITCHJNE9.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: List of Parts Materials and Tools"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Assuming that you may wish to re-use the diffuser dome in your project then, using a pair of side cutters, start to nip into the housing just below the dome baseline as shown in the picture.Nibble enough away to get a reasonably wide bladed flat screwdriver between the holder and the dome lip.Gently prise the dome off with the screwdriver; it is only held on using a white silicon rubber sealant.Remove the two self tapping screws.Carefully lift the edge of the module, opposite to the hole where the wires attach, and cut or desolder the two wires.

Some alternative bulbs look to have a smaller diameter module than this one. All components sit just within an envelope of 43mm diameter and 3mm height, located centrally on the PCB. The hole in the PCB next to the power attachment pads conveniently allows the cable to be fitted to exit above or below the PCB.The sensitivity of the IR receiver IC seems good and given that even the opaque acrylics don't seem to attenuate IR light that much, the remote works well even with the PCB completely covered with black acrylic.For this application, I wanted to place the light under the base of a glass ornament. The base measured just under 66mm diameter. The basic design that I used comprises three acrylic parts which are: -Base (3mm black acrylic)    Retaining ring (3mm clear acrylic)    Locating ring (3mm black acrylic)The Base ring (1) has a 47mm diameter x 1mm deep recess to hold the RGB PCB.  A 4mm wide x 2mm deep channel is for the cable exit.  I had to pare down the cable that I had to about 1mm the so that it would fit under the PCB.  A better solution might be to use 4mm acrylic for the base and make the channel deeper or just place a hole below the cable outlet on the PCB.  Another option would be to put a slot in the Retaining ring and bring the cable out from the top of the PCB. This may also be a good option if you don't have access to a CNC router.The Retaining ring (2) is there to hold the PCB in place and needs to have hole about 43mm diameter to clear the components.The Locating ring (3) is optional and is only there to hold the glass ornament that I was using in place and could be omitted. If you are going to make something like an RGB coaster then I suggest filling the hole in the Retaining ring with a clear non corrosive silicone or just cover retaining ring with a disc of clear or translucent acrylic. The choice of colours is arbitrary but I went for a black-clear-black acrylic sandwich such that the light would be seen out of the clear centre filling.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FBF/QDD6/ITBUS0JR/FBFQDD6ITBUS0JR.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Design Your Puck"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Having extracted the RGB module, prepare the speaker cable, or the end of your 12V DC supply cable, to attach to the PCB power pads.  It is best to place the cable in the final orientation (above or below the hole) then strip and trim the ends to the correct length to align with the pads so that no undue strain is placed on the pads when finally soldered.Once you are happy with the location of the cable, tin the ends and attach it to the PCB by carefully soldering the two ends to the two pads on the PCB.  Make sure that the + and - on the PCB pads correspond with the polarity of the power supply to be used.As I had access to a cheap Chinese engraving/milling machine, it was just a matter of designing three simple parts.  The parts are simple enough that you can design them straight into CAM software to produce your G Code.    I used CAMBAM, which is fairly easy to use and is relatively cheap, although the parts that I machined were simple enough to be designed and cut using the restricted evaluation version.Once the parts have been cut out of the acrylic is it worth leaving the protective film on until you are ready to glue the parts together.  Make sure the parts are OK by doing a dry fit and deburring and trimming as necessary.When ready, remove the protective film from the faces of the base and retaining ring where they are to be glued.  Apply a smear of glue to fully cover the top part of the base and a couple of drops in the cable recess.  Carefully align the two together with the RGB module sandwiched in between.  When you are happy with the alignment, place some weight on top to keep the parts held together for at least 30 minutes until the glue has dried.The locating ring can then be glued in the same way.When both parts have been glued, sand and polish the edge of the assembly as required and add the felt pads to the base.If you are using it as a coaster, fill the hole in the retain ring with a clear non corrosive (ie does not give off acetic acid) silicone rubber enough to provide some protection from spills etc.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FLP/EHKG/IT22SSDL/FLPEHKGIT22SSDL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F45/SCOD/IT68A9EL/F45SCODIT68A9EL.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Making the Puck"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Here some pictures of the puck and the glass ornament as well as some other variations.1) A short video clip of the glass ornament and puck2) The same glass ornament in blue3) A beer coaster (other beers are available)4) With the original light bulb dome used as a diffuser5, 6 & 7) Or you can just fix the bare PCB and wires into your display cabinet using double sided tape", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQD/DJAQ/IT22SSDK/FQDDJAQIT22SSDK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKI/DSL8/IT22TV86/FKIDSL8IT22TV86.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXF/LQAG/IT22SSDG/FXFLQAGIT22SSDG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAT/2LN2/ITCHJLGM/FAT2LN2ITCHJLGM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFJ/SL50/ITCHJLGH/FFJSL50ITCHJLGH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCG/68N7/ITCHJLGK/FCG68N7ITCHJLGK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Illuminate Your Decorative Object"}], "channel": "LEDs"}, {"category": "technology", "description": "Light-Emitting Diode / LED Is have so many colors and so many types.

After ordering a few kits for me to play with, I ended up frustrated at the complexity and lack of versatility that the kits were giving me, and they weren't cheap or compact like I wanted. So after studying Adafruits NeoPixel Ring (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:289846), I decided to try changing it to what I wanted and needed from my light ring.

After a few prototypes we mocked up and a little trial an error, we ended up with a unit that costs under $50, gives you multiple color options, is basically plug-n-play, and gives you just as good of photos as an expensive professional unit. This set up is so versatile, it can be used around the lens or as a separate light source. The remote allows you to quickly and easily change the color of your lighting without having to reprogram the light. And since it's LED, it never gets hot and lasts for hours on one charge.

By combining the three colors, (almost) every color can be created. The RGB led strip is controlled by one input (still a bit of magic to me). So, by connecting one wire, you can control all the leds in the strip!Behind every letter on the face of the Word Clock (please see later this step) hides one led of the RGB led strip. So, when one led turns on, it should light up one letter. To accomplish this, I used a laser cutter to cut out a grid of wooden board. In other Instructables, this grid was made using foam strips that are put together in a grid. I also tried this, but this did not work out for me. However, in my first version, I made the grid out of thin wooden strips which I glued together. This works perfectly fine, but takes a lot of time to build!The brain of the Word Clock is the Arduino Nano. This tiny computer is able to control the RGB led strip. You can find infinitely many programs on the internet to mess around with, quite fun!To avoid a lot of soldering (which takes time and is quite a craft), I use a terminal adapter for the Arduino Nano. All a terminal adapter does is to enable us to connect our wires to the Arduino using screws.Of course, the purpose of any clock, besides being pretty, is to display the time. In my Word Clock, an Real Time Clock module (RTC) keeps track of the time. The idea of this module is that once you set the correct time, it keeps ticking (until its battery is dead). I work with the DS3231 RTC, which is quite cheap and a lot of support is available on the internet.Now the inside of the Word Clock is clear, we move on to the outside.From experience I know it is important to start your project from a convenient base. That is why I build almost all my Word Clocks using the RIBBA frame of IKEA. The advantage of this is that you start with a frame of which all angles are nicely 90 degrees and the finish of the outside is seamless.Of course, you can build your own frame if you like, but I would stick to the RIBBA frame.The face of the Word Clock is determined by the letters through which the light indicates the time. I found two ways of creating this face:Printing on transparent foil. You can print the negative of the letters on the foil. The black ink stems the light. A drawback of this option is that the ink should be dense enough to be non-transparent. A possible solution is to print the face twice and stack them on top of each other.  Laser cutting paper. If you are able to use a laser cutter, an option is to cut-out the letters from paper. If the paper is thick enough, no light will pass. However, you should use a 'stencil' font. These kind of fonts have no close circles. So, for example, the 'o' will not be just a hole in the paper, but actually a 'o'. What does the Word Clock do?Of course, the Word Clock should tell you the time. Besides, since we are using a RGB led strip, you can light up any letter in (almost) any color you want!You can set the color of the individual RGB leds by programming the Arduino Nano. If you want to be able to change the colors of the leds in real time, you can add a button that does this for you. However, since I want to keep it simple for now, this is not included in this Instructable.Recently, I developed a Word Clock which uses Bluetooth to set the colors and the time.

It is convenient to have male-male, male-female and female-female wires, however, male-male wires will do too (with a bit of extra soldering). Price: 3 euro.- Power supply. The RGB led strip uses 5V. It is important to not exceed this voltage, because the RGB led strips are easily damaged. Each led uses 20-60mA. Since we use 169 leds, the amperage that is needed to power the leds is quite large. Therefore, I recommend to use at least a 2000mA power supply, such as these: Power supply.Price: 5 euro.- One 400-500 ohm resistor.Price: negligible.- One 1000 uF capacitor.Price: negligible.- One prototype board, such as these: Protoboard.Price: 1 euro. - A piece of wood (board) to form the back of the Clock.Price: 2 euro.- A wooden strip of about 3x2cm to attach the back of the Word Clock to the frame.Price: 1 euro.- Two wire nuts (to connect to times 5 wires), available at your local DIY shop.Price: 2 euro.Total price: about 40 euro.The equipment needed:- Pencil- Soldering station- Stripping tool- Screwdrivers- Scissors- Double-sided tape (to fix the components)- Saw (to saw the board for the back of the Word Clock)- A piece of cloth (to prevent scratches on the RIBBA frame while working on it)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FGM/QSFA/JBWK0XK1/FGMQSFAJBWK0XK1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6O/YWML/JBWK0XK4/F6OYWMLJBWK0XK4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGT/SDXB/JBWK0XKV/FGTSDXBJBWK0XKV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQO/I0WB/JBWK0XR9/FQOI0WBJBWK0XR9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL9/8NC7/JBWK0XS1/FL98NC7JBWK0XS1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFU/Y8BB/JBWK0XYJ/FFUY8BBJBWK0XYJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF7/1RA8/JBWK0Y47/FF71RA8JBWK0Y47.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F50/N41A/JBWK0Y49/F50N41AJBWK0Y49.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3B/G9PI/JBWK0Y9Y/F3BG9PIJBWK0Y9Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSB/KXAB/JBWK0YGA/FSBKXABJBWK0YGA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD7/30JZ/JBWK0YGD/FD730JZJBWK0YGD.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Gathering Materials and Equipment"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Now we have all the materials, it is nice to have a overview of the general idea of the Word Clock.The face of the Word Clock consists of the letters (either printed on transparent foil or laser cut out of cardboard). Behind every letter hides one led of the RGB led strip. Since the RIBBA frame measures 23x23cm and we use a RGB led strip consisting of 60 leds per meter (so 100cm/60leds=1.67cm per led), we can fit 23cm/1.67=13.8 leds in one row. Since 0.8 led may be a little inconvenient, we stick to 13 leds per row. Since the RIBBA frame is square, we will (later) construct a 'led-matrix' of 13x13 leds. Simply said, the Word Clock consists of a little clock (the RTC DS3231) which once set, keeps ticking. This little clock communicates the time to the tiny computer (the Arduino Nano). The tiny computer knows which leds should turn on for a specific time. So, the tiny computer sends a signal though the data wire to the RGB led strip and turns on the leds.This sounds quite simple, doesn't it?! :) ", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 2: The Overview"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "How to construct the face?As said, I found two ways to create the face of the Word Clock:Printing on transparent foil.

In the Dutch language, these 169 letters are just enough to describe the time per minute. You can reuse some words, for example the only difference between '19 minutes to 4' (15:41) and '19 minutes past 4' (16:19) are just the words to and past. It is quite fun to think about how to display the time in your language: be creative and you will find a way to optimally use the 169 letters!Adding your signatureOf course, you are proud of your work and you deserve to be acknowledged! I added my own name (Bas) in the very down right corner of the face, just like famous painters do on their masterpiece. Designing the faceI designed the face of my Word Clock using Adobe Illustrator. First, I created a square measuring 230x230mm on layer 1. Second, I constructed a 14x14 grid on layer 2. By placing the letters (on layer 1) on the grid-intersections, you are sure that the letters are aligned.

Laser cutting the gridThe most easy way to create the grid is to use a laser cutter to cut the grid out of a wooden board (thickness 3-6mm). The template (.ai format) is attached to this step. Please note that some letters (such as the 'M' take up more space then other letter (such as the 'I'). Therefore, you may need to make some grid cells slightly bigger than others. Gluing the gridIf you do not have a laser cutter that you can use, an alternative way of creating the grid is to use wooden strips and glue them together. A drawback of doing this is that it takes a lot of time and it is quite difficult to get the grid right. However, I did it in the first versions of my Word Clock and it works perfectly.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJJ/J1OY/JD2FAAOS/FJJJ1OYJD2FAAOS.LARGE.jpg", "/assets/img/pixel.png"], "step_title": "Step 4: The Grid Behind the Face"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "We will use 13 leds in one row and 13 rows, which adds up to a 13x13 led matrix.Cutting the RGB led stripCut 13 strips of the RGB led strip of a length of 13 leds. You have to cut the RGB led strip at the middle of the three copper ovals. Assembling the 13 RGB led stripsWe stick the 13 led strips to the wooden board that is included in the RIBBA frame. There is a hook glued to the board, which can easily be removed using a screwdriver. Using the grid (of the previous step), you can easily mark the position of each led on the board. Most of the RGB led strips have a sticky back, so that you can easily stick them to the board. It is important to note the direction of the RGB led strip. The arrows on the RGB led strip indicate the direction in which the current flows. Since we want to connect the 13 RGB led strips, we have to create a continuous path for the current to flow.Recently, IKEA cut one corner of the board, so that it is more easy to get the board out of the frame. It is convenient to use this cut corner to get the wires from one side of the board to the other. In other words, make sure that the first led is located in the cut corner.Soldering the 13 RGB led stripsNow the 13 RGB led strips are stuck on the board, we can connect them using the soldering iron. First, dispense a little bit of solder on each half of the copper ovals. Second, cut the jumper wires strip one end. Again, dispense a little bit of solder on the stripped end of the wire. Now, led the stripped end of the wire touch the copper oval and use the solder iron melt the solder and connect them. Connect the GND of one RGB led strip to the GND of the next RGB led strip.

It is convenient to place the terminal adapter in the middle of the board, since quite a few wires need to be connected to the terminal adapter. Connect the data wire of the RGB led strip (the middle wire) to one of the digital ports of the Arduino Nano (usually I use port D6).

The 'Vin' port can handle 7-12V, the 5V port can handle 5V (what a surprise) and you can power the Arduino Nano using the usb mini cable. However, the RGB led strip is more picky in its demands. Most manufacturers prescribe a 5V +/- 5% input to their RGB led strips (for more information see powering Neopixels). Therefore, we will use a 5V power supply. CurrentOne RGB led actually contains three separate leds (a red, green and blue one) which together form the desired color. One of the three leds uses about 20mA. So, a RGB led that emits the color white by putting on the red, green and blue led simultaneously uses 3*20mA=60mA. If you light up all the 169 RGB leds at once in the color white, you need 169*60mA=10140mA=10A*. Most common power supplies are about 2000mA. So, in other words, lighting up all RGB leds at once in the color white is not a very bright idea**. I recommend to use a 5V, 2000mA power supply, since they are common and quite cheap.* Please pay attention that high currents (above 5mA) are dangerous! So, please be very careful when powering the Word Clock!** There are some tricks to light up all RGB leds at once, such as connecting the power supply to both ends of the RGB led strip, or using the RGB leds at a lower brightness. Connecting the power supplyWe will connect the power supply to the components. We will connect a 1000 uF capacitor over the positive and negative wire of the power supply. You can use a protoboard to secure the connection (see picture). Since we have quite some components that needs power, we connect each of the two wires of the 5V power supply to one wire nut: we will call them the positive wire nut (which is connected to the positive wire of the power supply) and negative wire nut (which is connected to the negative wire of the power supply). Now, connect the 5V wires of the RGB led strip and the RTC DS3231 to the positive wire nut. Similarly, connect the ground wires (GND) of the RGB led strip and the RTC DS3231 to the negative wire nut. We will power the Arduino Nano through its 5V port and one of its ground ports. To do this, connect the 5V port of the Arduino to the positive wire nut and one of the GND ports to the negative wire nut. Securing the power supply To avoid ripping apart all your nicely wired electronics, it is recommended to fix the cord of the power supply to the inside of the RIBBA frame. You can to this by simply making a knot in the power cord before it leaves through the back of the Word Clock.  However, a more elegant way is to secure the cord by clamping it to the inside of the RIBBA frame. You can easily do this by using a little piece of wood and screwing it to the inside of the RIBBA frame using two screws. Clamp the cord of the power supply between the piece of wood and the RIBBA frame. In my latest version of the Word Clock, I used a little hinge (about 3cm) to secure the power cord. A advantage of this is that you do not have to cut a little piece of wood.

Luckily, my brother in law is a Masters in Computer Science, so programming the Arduino was a piece of cake for him. So, all the credits for programming are for him (thanks Laurens)!The basic idea is that you indicate which leds are part of which word. Note that the first led is indicated as led number 0. So we have 0-168 leds. Next, you tell the Arduino which words need to light up at a specific time. You set the time on the RTC DS3231, so that the Arduino knows what the current time is. The colors of the leds of the RGB led strip are determined by a value of 0-255 for red, green and blue. So, a red led is denoted by (red, green, blue) = (255, 0, 0) and a purple led by (reg, green, blue) = (255, 0, 255). A led that is not used has the color (red, green, blue) = (0, 0, 0). You can group the words according to their purpose: A group that always lights up ('It', 'is', your name, etc.)   A group for words that indicate the minutes   A group of coupling words ('past', 'to', 'half', 'quarter', etc.)   A group of words that indicate the hours   A group that covers all letters that you do not use at the current timeFor each word group you can set a color (this is easier than defining a color for each word or even letter separately).You can upload you program by connecting the Arduino Nano to your computer using a usb mini cable.UPDATE (January 2019): I added the Arduino-file to the Instructable.

My lamp measures 30\"x30\" square and is 3.5\" tall. \u00a0This size was arbitrary, you can adjust it based on the size of the room or number of LEDs.Assembly Steps:1) To start with, cut 4 pieces of the sheetrock bead 30\" in length. \u00a0Using these pieces, form a box as shown in the picture and install a rivet in each corner. \u00a0I recommend using a square to make sure all the corners are even.2) Next, cut 4 pieces 3.5\" in length for the vertical wall supports. \u00a0Again, the height of the walls was arbitrary.3) Place one 3.5\" piece in each corner and rivet into place. \u00a0This adds rigidity to the square, as well as vertical support for the walls.4) Now cut cardboard pieces to fit in the bottom of the square and the four walls. \u00a0The cardboard can also be riveted to the sheetrock bead. \u00a0Just poke a little starter hole through the cardboard before inserting the rivet, and be sure to use a washer on the side of the rivet that presses against the cardboard (otherwise the rivet will pull through).5) (Optional step) Paint the inside of the lamp a bright color to help reflect the light. \u00a0I used white semi-gloss paint since I had it on the shelf.6) Finally I suggest wrapping the outside of the lamp with your fabric of choice. \u00a0I chose a flat black fabric to match the room decor, but you could really pick any fabric. \u00a0Just pull the fabric tight and affix it with hot glue!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F7N/EH6R/H3Z3VE6Q/F7NEH6RH3Z3VE6Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN3/QC8K/H3Z3VXX0/FN3QC8KH3Z3VXX0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSX/C3VK/H45WXHSK/FSXC3VKH45WXHSK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Building the Lamp"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Circuit Details: The control circuitry is about as simple and it gets (See the attached schematic). \u00a0There is a PIC 16F1829 microcontroller with three PWM outputs, and each output uses a bipolar transistor driver and current limiting resistor to interface to the LED strings. \u00a0If you're looking for more electrical efficiency, you could try using a specialized LED control IC like the ZXLD1350. I opted to run each LED string in series for ease of wiring, ease of control, and greater efficiency (only one current limiting resistor for 9 LEDs). \u00a0You do give up some freedom, since now you can only control each color channel instead of each LED individually. I used a crystal oscillator to provide the microcontroller clock because a) I had one laying around, and b) I wanted to make sure I had accurate timing for the remote control decoding. \u00a0There is an internal oscillator in the PIC 16F1829 that you could potentially use to reduce parts count. The IR detector/decoder is one I found in the parts bin. \u00a0You could use any type of IR detector, but I like the can type since they have built-in filters and amplification.Power Supply and Current Limiting Resistors: You want to select a power supply voltage for the series LED strings that is as close as possible to the total series voltage of the LEDs to minimize power dissipated in the current limiting resistors. \u00a0Once you have selected a voltage, use Ohm's Law to calculate the resistance needed for each LED string. \u00a0According to the LED datasheet, each LED can handle 0.35A of current for full brightness and the TIP121 Collector-Emitter saturation voltage is 0.75V. \u00a0Remember that the LED voltage drop for each color will be different.\u00a0 Calculate resistance: R = (Supply_Voltage - (9*LED_Voltage_Drop) - 0.75V))/(0.350) And, calculate power dissipated: P = R^2 * 0.350 I used a 30V power supply, so this required a 29 Ohm 3.6W resistor for the Red string and 6.3 Ohm, 0.7W resistor for the Green/Blue strings. \u00a0I dug around in the junk box and ended ended up with 30 Ohm 10W and 6.8 Ohm 2W respectively.

Using the spreadsheet and the time-stamped scope data, I discovered each IR signal had three parts - a start pulse, a 16-bit Remote ID (which is the same for all buttons), and then a 16-bit Button Code which is unique for each button. \u00a0By looking at the last 16-bits of the IR signal, we are able to discern which button was pressed. The one tricky part to using the remote code is when you hold down any button, the remote sends out an identical \"repeat code\" until the button is released. \u00a0This repeat code is very similar to the start pulse, but with different time durations.Using the IR Signals: I have the IR signal connected to the PIC Interrupt-On-Change pin. \u00a0Using the internal Timer 0 module, we can count the time period between falling edges on this pin. \u00a0Everytime there is a falling edge, the PIC saves the state of the TMR0 register (to record the previous period) and then restarts TMR0 (to record the next period). \u00a0Using this information, we can determine whether a 1, 0, Start pulse, or Repeat pulse was received.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQR/7BJ3/H3Z32A6S/FQR7BJ3H3Z32A6S.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTB/QK0Y/H45WXHXW/FTBQK0YH45WXHXW.LARGE.jpg", "/assets/img/pixel.png"], "step_title": "Step 4: Hacking the Remote"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "The code for this project was written in Microchip's Assembly language. \u00a0Both the commented source code and compiled hex file are attached. \u00a0A rough flowchart of the program flow (related to each button) is attached in the pictures below. \u00a0 The program consists of three main parts: 1) IR Code Buffering 2) IR Code interpretation 3) PWM Control (RGB Fixed color, color fading, and white-light mode).IR Code Buffering: Using the process described in Step 4 - \"Hacking the Remote\" I learned that the length of a 0, 1, Start Pulse, and Repeat pulse were all unique and repeatable values. \u00a0Every time the PIC sensed a falling edge on pin 17 (Interrupt-on-change) it would record the time since the last falling edge and then compare that value to a series of time \"windows\" to determine which type of pulse just came in. \u00a0You can see a rough flowchart of this process in the images below. \u00a0The window comparison code is not original, I found it at the excellent PICLIST Website (http://www.piclist.org/techref/piclist/index.htm). \u00a0If the length does not fall into any window, I set a Bad Code (BC) flag and ignore everything until the next start pulse. \u00a0IR Code interpretation: Every time a 1 or 0 is detected, the PIC pushes that value into an 8-bit FIFO register. \u00a0Even though the pulse train from the remote is more than 8 bits, we always end up with the last 8 in the register, which happens to contain a unique value for each key of interest. \u00a0I compare this code to the known digital value for each key (these were measured on the oscilloscope in Step 4) to figure out which button was pressed and which action to take (White light mode, RGB mode, Increase Fader Speed, etc). \u00a0This 8-bit value is saved into a second register so that if the repeat pulse shows up, we will know which command is being repeated.PWM Control: The PIC 16F1829 has 4 10-bit hardware PWM registers which makes it ideal for RGB color control. \u00a0By using the hardware PWM modules the PIC is free to do other stuff while the PWM is going in the background. The intensity of each color is controlled by 10-bits. \u00a0When the lamp is turned on, each value is at max to give white light. \u00a0When the \"CONV\" button is pressed, a 3-part loop begins in the software.

The conductive parts of the breadboard allow electrons to flow between the things you plug into it.On the right you can see inside a breadboard to observe how these sockets are connected. Two long rails run down each side, marked with red and blue lines on the front. These long connectors are typically used for power and ground connections, which are used quite often. The small horizontal rows that comprise the middle of the board are for plugging in wires and components. Notice the divider down the middle of the board-- this exists to provide chips a place to straddle, providing independent access to each of its pins.

Let's start out slowly, with one wire connection at a time. Follow along with the same colored wires to make it easier on us both. Double check that your USB cable is disconnected before doing any wiring to your board. Grab a red wire and plug one end into the pin marked 5V on the Arduino board. Plug the other end of the red wire into the breadboard rail marked with a red line\u2014 this will be your power bus. Similarly, grab a blue wire and plug it into one of the pins marked GND, right next to the red wire. There are three ground pins on an Arduino Uno, and they're all wired to the same ground as the chip and the rest of the board, so it doesn't matter which one you choose. Plug the other end of your blue wire to the blue ground bus on your breadboard. This is a common configuration you will use again and again, and should be your go-to setup for new breadboards, even if you aren't using both buses immediately. Circuits in this lesson will connect to the ground bus, and in the next lesson you'll use some components that will connect to the 5V power bus.Next, plug a yellow wire into Arduino pin 13. Plug the other end into any horizontal row on your breadboard (row 10 shown above). For this first circuit, all of your connections should be composed on the half of the breadboard closest to the Arduino board.Connect another blue wire from any pin on your ground rail to another horizontal row on your breadboard (row 18 shown above). Now grab a 1K resistor (stripes are brown-black-red-gold), and plug one of its wire leads (doesn't matter which) into the same row as the blue wire. Resistors all look similar, except for the stripes used to indicate their value.Plug the other end into a row right next to the yellow wire.Now grab a red LED (light emitting diode). See how one of its wire leads is longer than the other? That's the positive lead (anode), and the shorter lead is negative (cathode). In the circuit we're building, positive charge comes from the Arduino pin and goes through the LED and resistor to ground, so you should connect the positive (longer) lead to the yellow wire and the negative (shorter) lead to the resistor. A resistor helps limit the current going through an LED, which doesn't do a great job of limiting itself.Another way to guess the polarity of an LED is by looking inside the lens at the anvil (bigger piece of metal) and post (smaller piece of metal). The anvil is usually the cathode, but as you can see in the above video, not all LEDs observe the same polarity conventions. The only way to be totally certain of its polarity is to test it. To learn more in-depth about resistors and LEDs, check out the LEDs lesson in the Instructables LEDs & Lighting Class.Plug in your USB cable and the LED should immediately start to blink! It's programmed to blink whatever's connected to pin 13. That includes the onboard LED you saw in your software setup as well as the one you just wired up.If your LED isn't blinking, unplug your USB cable, then reverse your LED and replug your USB; maybe the LED was just plugged in backwards (which won't damage it, but won't light it up, either). Or perhaps one of your other wires or resistor aren't connected correctly. Double check your connections against the diagram of the circuit:Click \"Start Simulation\" to run the Arduino emulator, which has the \"blink\" sample program loaded up. We'll use Autodesk Circuits modules like this one throughout the class to help you build along. They contain wiring diagrams for your breadboard experiments as well as the code you'll need for each. Click the \"Code Editor\" button to see the program, called an Arduino sketch. It looks like this:You'll use the Arduino IDE to manipulate programs like this one and send them to your Arduino board to run. You've already loaded this sketch onto your Arduino board in the software setup from the previous lesson, but a refresher can't hurt: you can find this sketch and many other examples used in this class through the Arduino software menu (File -> Examples -> Basics -> Blink).Example sketches make great starting points for experimentation and your own projects down the line. These examples are invaluable to your Arduino learning experience; use them! It's common to make lots of typos when writing your first code, which can cause confusing errors. The examples come in handy is when you want to fix up your own not-working code (called debugging). Comparing your work to definitive examples of working code can be one helpful strategy to help debug your code.Let's take a closer look at the elements of this basic Arduino sketch. First up is a little note:// Pin 13 has an LED connected on most Arduino boards.\n// give it a name:This is just a comment, meant to help humans understand the program. In Arduino programs, comments are signified with two slashes; anything on a single line after the slashes is discarded when it comes time to compile (build this code into the machine-readable version that will run on the Arduino board). Therefore comments don't contribute to your program's size, so comment away! You may easily forget what each section of your program is supposed to accomplish; I strongly recommend you to get into the habit of heavily commenting your code, and reading the comments in each of the examples we use in this class.int led = 13;\nNext up is a variable declaration. You can think of a variable as a bucket for some information. Variables, like buckets, have sizes and shapes to hold different kinds of information. Variables also have names, like a mandatory label on the bucket. This line of code defines a variable of type int, which means integer. Remember back to primary school math class, when you might have learned that integers are whole numbers (positive or negative). So we have a bucket that can hold an integer. It's label is led but could just as easily be \"MyLEDPin\" or any single word (letters and numbers only, case sensitive) because this part of the variable declaration is up to you. I strongly advise using descriptive names for your variables so you can keep track of what your program is doing! After the line of code above, any time we see \"led\" in the program will be swapped out for the number 13. This is handy for configurations like ours, where we want a way to reference which pin the LED is connected to, over and over, but if the wiring changes we'll only have to update it on one place in the code.// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:\nvoid setup() {\nAs the comment suggests, anything between this line and the closing curly brace } is part of the setup, a section of code that runs once per session. Code inside the setup executes one time when your board first powers up, or when you press the Arduino's reset button.  // initialize the digital pin as an output.\n  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);\n}\n\nPins 0-13 on your Arduino board are digital i/o pins, which means they can be either inputs or outputs. pinMode(); is a function, a shorthand way to refer to subset of commands \"under the hood,\" so to speak. Arduino shows you it recognizes certain elements of code by changing its text color. If ever a keyword isn't changing color as you type it in Arduino, you probably have a misspelling, capitalization error, or other typo. These pieces of information passed to functions are called arguments. Since the variable led will serve up its contents anytime you type it, the pin number passed to pinMode(); is 13, and the state is OUTPUT. This sets up pin 13 to control an LED, and the curly brace closes the setup.// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:\nvoid loop() {\n\nThis is the main part of an Arduino sketch, where actions like checking input pins and controlling output pins usually happen. Everything between this line and its closing curly brace } will occur on repeat until the board loses power.digitalWrite(led, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)\n\nFirst up in the loop is a function called digitalWrite();, which takes two pieces of information: a pin number, and a HIGH (on) or LOW (off) state. These pieces of information passed to functions are called arguments. Since the variable led will serve up its contents anytime you type it, the pin number passed to digitalWrite(); is 13, and the state is HIGH (on). This line of code causes the LED in your circuit to turn on. delay(1000);               // wait for a second\ndelay(); is another one of Arduino's built-in functions. It pauses the program for an amount of time, written in milliseconds. This line of code pauses the program for 1000ms, or one second.digitalWrite(led, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW\n\nAs earlier, digitalWrite(); can turn an output pin on or off. This time it sets pin 13 LOW (off).delay(1000);               // wait for a second\n}\n\nThis line pauses the program for one second, and the curly brace signifies the end of the loop, which begins again immediately. So to summarize, the program turns an LED on and off at one second intervals. Let's try switching up that interval. Modify the number of milliseconds in one or both of your delay(); statements. For instance you could create a more uneven blink:void loop() {\n  digitalWrite(led, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)\n  delay(2000);               // wait for two seconds\n  digitalWrite(led, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW\n  delay(500);                // wait for a half second\n}\n\nTry uploading your modified blink sketch to your Arduino board. Did it behave as you expected it would?Well done! That was a lot of information. It's ok if you don't quite understand every little thing yet. Like learning any language, the Arduino programming language has its own syntax and structure you must navigate, which will become more familiar with regular practice. The most important thing to remember is that you can work with code without knowing everything about programming. As you go through the exercises in this class, I encourage you to leave a window open loaded with the Arduino language reference page, which describes each element and provides sample usage.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F4A/8PZG/IV0AL32U/F4A8PZGIV0AL32U.LARGE.jpg", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png"], "step_title": "Step 3: Blink Circuit"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Now that you've got the basic idea of how to control a single LED, let's add some more! Grab the rest of your red LEDs and 1K resistors. Unplug your Arduino from USB/power if it wasn't already. It's smart to disconnect power any time you are changing your circuit.Connect the two pairs of rails on your solderless breadboard: plug a wire connecting both power buses (red, +) and another wire connecting both ground buses (blue, -). This is a commonly used configuration, since now you can easily access power and ground on both edges of the breadboard. Bend the leads of your resistors to 90 degrees and trim the ends to about a quarter inch (6mm) from the bend.You don't technically have to bend and trim your resistors, but they sure do tidy up your breadboard. Replace the resistor on your breadboard with a tidier one and see what a huge difference it makes in the legibility of your circuit. And you're less likely to create an accidental short circuit this way, too.Let's add the new LEDs to the thus-far-unused half of the breadboard. Start by connecting a tidy resistor from ground (sockets along the blue line) to a row of the breadboard. Plug a red LED into the breadboard, connecting its shorter (negative) lead at the same row as the resistor.Add the remaining resistors and LEDs in the same pattern. Remember that resistors can plug in either orientation, but LEDs have polarity and only light up when electricity flows in one particular direction through them.Move the yellow wire from Arduino pin 13 to pin 7. Connect another yellow wire from Arduino pin 6 to the positive lead of the next neighboring LED.Connect up more yellow wires according to the circuit diagram in the Autodesk Circuits module (Arduino pins 3-5 to the remaining LEDs' positive leads).Click the \"Start Simulation\" button to see where we're going with the code side of things. The program lights up one LED at a time, in order, down the line and back again. Click the \"Code Editor\" button to see the code, and then click the \"Download Code\" button. This example varies slightly from a similar example that comes with the Arduino software, so we'll use this downloadable version instead. Double click on the .zip file to expand it, and double click on the \"ForLoopIteration.ino\" file to open it. Click OK if you see a prompt to put the program in its own folder. If your resulting file has all the code bunched up on one line, you are probably using an old version of Arduino, and should update to the latest version. If you prefer, you may also select and copy the code from the module above and paste it into a new (blank) Arduino sketch (File -> New, then replace the default contents with the code you copied from above). Plug in and upload the code to your Arduino Uno board. You may have to select your port again from the tools menu after replugging. Let's learn how to code a light sequence by taking a closer look at the program elements:/*\n  For Loop Iteration\n\n Demonstrates the use of a for() loop.\n Lights multiple LEDs in sequence, then in reverse.\n\n The circuit:\n * LEDs from pins 3 through 7 to ground\n\n created 2006\n by David A. Mellis\n modified 30 Aug 2011\n by Tom Igoe\n\nThis example code is in the public domain.\n\n <a href=\"http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ForLoop\"> <a href=\"http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ForLoop\"> http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ForLoop\n</a>\n</a>\n */\nThis first part is just a long comment. You already learned about single line comments, and now you know about multi-line comments, signified with a /* to start and */ to stop.int timer = 200;           // The higher the number, the slower the timing.\nA variable is declared! It's an integer called \"timer\", and this line sets it equal to 200. As you may have noticed, most lines of Arduino programs end with a semicolon. When writing and modifying your own Arduino sketches, watch out for missing semicolons as they will cause compiling errors that will trip you up.void setup() {\n  // use a for loop to initialize each pin as an output:\n  for (int thisPin = 3; thisPin < 8; thisPin++) {\n    pinMode(thisPin, OUTPUT);\n  }\n}\nThe setup configures pins 3 through 7 as outputs using a for loop, which is a special loop that repeats a small section of code a certain number of times based on a condition, using an increment counter. Each time through the mini loop, the condition is tested and if true, will continue on to execute the code inside. So above, a variable thisPin is set to 3, the condition is that thisPin should be less than 8, and the increment counter increases thisPin by one each time through the loop (thisPin++ is the same as saying thisPin = thisPin + 1). So the first time through this loop, pin 3 is set to an output. The second time through, pin 4 is set to an output. And so forth until thisPin is 8, at which point the condition is false and the code discontinues looping, continuing on with the rest of the program. This may seem like a convoluted way to do a simple thing, but programmers love efficiency! You could just as easily accomplish the pin configurations with the following setup:void setup() {\n  // initialize each pin as an output:\n  pinMode(3, OUTPUT);\n  pinMode(4, OUTPUT);\n  pinMode(5, OUTPUT);\n  pinMode(6, OUTPUT);\n  pinMode(7, OUTPUT);\n}\nYou'll notice that there will usually be more than one way to accomplish the same tasks with Arduino programming. Coding is similar to making things in your workshop: you tend to use whatever tools you have. So lets use a for loop for something fun... animation!void loop() {\n  \n  // loop from the lowest pin to the highest:\n  for (int thisPin = 3; thisPin <  8; thisPin++) {\n    // turn the pin on:\n    digitalWrite(thisPin, HIGH);\n    delay(timer);\n    // turn the pin off:\n    digitalWrite(thisPin, LOW);\n  }\nThe loop starts out with the same for loop as earlier, incrementing from the lowest pin number to the highest. Inside the for loop, it turns on the LED at thisPin, pauses for 200ms (set earlier as timer), then turns that LED off before looping again with the next LED.  // loop from the highest pin to the lowest:\n  for (int thisPin = 7; thisPin >= 3; thisPin--) {\n    // turn the pin on:\n    digitalWrite(thisPin, HIGH);\n    delay(timer);\n    // turn the pin off:\n    digitalWrite(thisPin, LOW);\n  }\n}\nThe next part of the code is another for loop, but this one starts at the highest pin and uses thisPin--, which means the same thing as thisPin = thisPin - 1 (itself minus one), and exits the loop when thisPin is no longer >= 3 (greater than or equal to three, aka 2). The final closing curly brace closes the main loop. So this program lights up each LED in order, then reverses the order and lights them up again.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSU/D2CC/IV0ABGXY/FSUD2CCIV0ABGXY.LARGE.jpg", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png"], "step_title": "Step 4: Add More LEDs"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Turning LEDs on and off is great and all, but now let's make an LED fade in and out gradually using a function called analogWrite();. Unplug your USB cable and remove all but the first LED from your breadboard, and move its yellow wire connection to Arduino pin 9.\nCopy/download the code from the Autodesk Circuits module or open up the example in your Arduino software examples under File -> Examples -> 01.Basics -> Fade.Plug in and upload the sketch to your Arduino Uno board and observe your LED fade on and off.Let's look at the code to learn how this fading is achieved. I have turned on line numbers in the Arduino preferences in order to better be able to reference the different parts of the code.Lines 16 through 18 declare three variables used in the program. The setup configures pin 9 as an output on line 23. On line 29, the function analogWrite(); sets pin 9 to whatever the variable brightness is at the given time. On line 32, brightness is incremented by 5 (fadeAmount). Line 35 uses an if statement to check if brightness using comparison operators. If brightness is less than or equal to  <= zero, or || greater than or equal to >= 255. If the statement is true, the code inside is executed, otherwise it's just skipped. So this code increases brightness until it reaches or exceeds 255, then sets fadeAmount to -5 and decrements brightness until it reaches zero (or dips below zero). The delay at the end prevents the code from running so fast that you can't see the effect. Try changing the value of fadeAmount and upload the code to your board. How does changing this variable affect the appearance of the fading?The Arduino board is only capable of generating digital signals (HIGH and LOW), but analogWrite(); simulates the appearance of brightnesses between on and off using pulse width modulation (PWM). The LED flashes on and off very quickly, and your eye interprets a dimmer light. The ratio of time the LED spends on vs. off determines how bright or dim the LED appears. Only certain pins are capable of PWM, and they are labeled on the board with squiggles ~ next to the pin number. PWM can also be used to control the speed of a DC motor, which we'll do in a later lesson.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FF5/CWKS/IV0AHJUL/FF5CWKSIV0AHJUL.LARGE.jpg", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png"], "step_title": "Step 5: Fade"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Additive (light-based) color has three primary colors: red, green, and blue. Simultaneously controlling the brightness of one LED of each of these colors can create almost any color of light. Color changing LEDs like those used in the final project work the same way, but the LEDs are all together in a very small package called an RGB LED. Let's build our own RGB LED from three 5mm LEDs in your kits. In the Adafruit kit recommended for this class, these three LEDs have clear lenses, so we'll have to plug them in to determine which LED is which. LEDs with clear lenses can be any color! If you're using a different kit, just find one red, one green, and one blue LED (clear or colored lens). Unplug your USB cable and swap out the red LED for one of the clear-lens LEDs, then plug the USB back in.What color is the LED? If you find the red one on the first try, set it aside and repeat the process to determine the color of the the other two LEDs.Wire up the other two LEDs with 1K resistors to pins 10 and 11, as shown in the diagram. Download and open the code from the Autodesk Circuits module or copy and paste it into a new empty Arduino sketch. Upload it to your Arduino Uno board and see if you can match up the lines of code to the activity you see in the LEDs, as we have done together so far.The unfamiliar part of this code is the function setColor();. It's a custom function, defined below the loop() has ended.void setColor(int red, int green, int blue)\n{\n  analogWrite(redPin, red);\n  analogWrite(greenPin, green);\n  analogWrite(bluePin, blue);  \n}\n\nA function definition declares a name, and what type of arguments the function will take, which you can think of as the configurable settings you'll want to change each time you execute the code it contains. In this simple function, three integer values are written to the three LED pins using analogWrite();.\nsetColor(255, 255, 0);  // yellow\nEach time this function is called in the main loop, the program executes the code in the function before continuing through the main loop. In this case, the arguments are used as the brightnesses of each LED. The scale for brightness is 0-255 because each color is defined using one byte, which allows for 256 distinct patterns.\nNow download and open the code from this more complex RGB project, or copy and paste the code into a new blank Arduino sketch. Read its comments to learn more about how this program works. It does some math to convert a 0-100 range to the necessary range the LEDs need, so you can think in percentages instead of 0-255. It uses collections of variables called arrays to store colors, and three user-defined functions to calculate values for a smooth fade between colors so that the loop() is nice and tidy. crossFade(red); almost reads like English! We'll get into some of the other unfamiliar keywords in this sketch in future lessons, but first it's time to celebrate all you've achieved so far. Take a picture of one of your circuits from this lesson and post it in the Class Project module at the bottom of the lesson, so I can give you a virtual high five!In the next lesson, we build on outputs by adding inputs!

It was demonstrated firstly by MIT using inductive coupling the summer 2007. In 2008, Intel also achieved wireless power through inductive coupling.I used inductive coupling method for Wireless charging of the lamp. In this project, oscillation circuit converts DC energy to AC energy(transmitter coil) to transmit magnetic field by passing frequency and then induce the receiver coil. The properties of Induction coupling are wave(magnetic field-wideband), range(very short~cm), efficiency(hight) and operation frequency(LF-band~several hundred kHz).Here I made a 5V charger for charging for a 3.7V Li-ion battery of the lamp in this method. The system bases on coupling magnetic field, then designed and constructed as two parts. There are transmitter part and receiver part. The transmitter coil (transmitter part) transmits coupling magnetic field to receiver coil (receiver part) by passing frequency at about 50KHz. The Ampere\u2019s law, Biot-Savart law, and Faraday law are used to calculate the inductive coupling between the transmitter coil and the receiver coil. The calculation of this law shows how many power transfer in receiver part when how many distances between the transmitter coil and the receiver coil. The system is safe for users and neighboring electronic devices.In this project, supply voltage 12 DC drives oscillator circuit as an h-bridge driver to operate transmitter coil. Then, the transmitter coil transmits coupling magnetic field by passing frequency at about 50KHz. In this state, there are AC voltage and the receiver coil receiver coupling magnetic field as AC voltage. A bridge rectifier with capacitor converts AC to DC voltage again to charge the battery of lamp.The complete circuit diagram of the project can be divided into two different sections:\u2022 Transmission section and\u2022 Receiving sectionBoth sections require an inductive coil for producing magnatic flux.Designing good coil is a very important thing. The efficiency of the charger depends on the coil. Coils determine the coupling factor and Q (quality) factor. Two coils should be identical for good coupling. The coupling between primary and secondary coils can be described by a coupling factor, k, a dimensionless number between 0 and 1. Coupling factor is equal to 1 if the secondary coil couples with all of the flux generated by the primary coil. The coupling between coils is highly sensitive to separation and alignment, however modeling the variation is not trivial, and mathematical derivations do not yield simple analytical expressions. A second important effect of a varying coupling factor is seen in the frequency response function of the coupled-tuned system.For my project, I designed two coils using 14AWS enameled copper wire of 25 turns. The diameter of the coil is 60mm and I found the inductance 0.045mH. I used super glue to form the coil in a base.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FDY/G89B/JAWU8CC8/FDYG89BJAWU8CC8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHF/Z7ZT/JB2S3R89/FHFZ7ZTJB2S3R89.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZQ/FKF2/JB2S3R91/FZQFKF2JB2S3R91.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F15/5ALW/JAWU8CBX/F155ALWJAWU8CBX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6T/13AN/JB2S3R93/F6T13ANJB2S3R93.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDC/JBGN/JB3ZPA5W/FDCJBGNJB3ZPA5W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGH/8XTL/JB3ZPBEZ/FGH8XTLJB3ZPBEZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Wireless Charging (Making the Coils)"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "The circuit is designed based on  Inductive coupling.  Inductive coupling is based on magnetic field induction that delivers electrical energy between two coils.  Inductive power transfer (IPT) happens when a primary coil of an energy transmitter generates a predominantly varying magnetic field across the secondary coil of the energy receiver within the field, generally less than a wavelength. The near-field magnetic power then induces voltage/current across the secondary coil of the energy receiver within the field. This voltage can be used for charging a wireless device or storage system. The operating frequency of inductive coupling is typically in the kilo Hertz range. The secondary coil should be tuned at the operating frequency to enhance charging efficiency. The quality factor is usually designed in small values (e.g., below 10), because the transferred power attenuates quickly for larger quality values. Due to lack of the compensation of high quality factors, the effective charging distance is generally within 20cm. Inductively coupled radio frequency identification (RFID)  is an example that pushes the limit to extend the charging distance to tens of centimeters, at the cost of diminished efficiency (e.g., 1-2%) with received power in micro watt range. Despite the limited transmission range, the effective charging power can be very high (e.g., kilowatt level for electric vehicle re-charging). The advantages of magnetic inductive coupling include ease of implementation, convenient operation, high efficiency in close distance (typically less than a coil diameter) and ensured safety. Therefore, it is applicable and popular for mobile devices. Very recently, MIT scientists have announced the invention of a novel wireless charging technology, called MagMIMO, which can charge a wireless device from up to 30cm away. It is claimed that MagMIMO can detect and cast a cone of energy toward a phone, even when the phone is put inside the pocket.In this project, the wireless charger works mainly on the principle of inductive coupling. With this inductive coupling idea, we are trying to transfer power wirelessly to charge low power devices, such as mobile phones, cameras, wireless mouse etc.From the block diagram, it is clear that for the overall functioning of wireless charger circuit, it required a wireless power transmitter & a wireless power receiver sections. The transmitter coil in this wireless power transmitter section converts the DC power from an oscillator to a high frequency AC power signal. This high frequency alternating current, which is linked with the wireless power transmitting coil, would create an alternating magnetic field in the coil due to induction, to transmit energy. In the wireless power receiver section, the receiver coils receives that energy as an induced alternating voltage (due to induction) in its coil and a rectifier in the wireless power receiver section converts that AC voltage to a DC voltage. Finally this rectified DC voltage would be feed to the load through a voltage controller section. That is, the wireless power receiver section\u2019s main function is to charge a low power battery through inductive coupling.The Transmitter section of wireless charger circuit consists of a DC power source, oscillator and a transmitter coil. A constant DC voltage is provided by a DC power source, and this DC signal is the input to the oscillator circuit. This oscillator converts this DC voltage to a high frequency AC power, and is supplied to the transmitting coil. Due to this high frequency AC current, the transmitter coil energizes, and generates an alternating magnetic field in the coil.DC power Source: It consists of a step down transformer that step downs the supply voltage to a desired level, and rectifier circuit to convert that AC voltage to DC signal. Another good option is a switch mode power supply. I used here a 12V SMPS.Oscillator Circuit:  The transmitter circuit consists of DC source, oscillator circuit, and a transmitter coil. oscillator circuit consists of four n channel MOSFETS  IRF540 (4 pcs) , 4148 diodes (provide cross-coupled feedback), 1uF capacitors, 102pf capacitor (works as a resonating capacitors, connected in series with the coil), 555 timer (PWM generator) and a hex inverter 4069.. When the 12 DC power is given to the oscillator, current starts flowing through the coil and drain terminal of the transistor. Current flows through the coil in either direction and the frequency is controlled by the PWM signal from 555 timer IC. I set the PWM frequency at 50KHz (determined by using formula F=1/[2\u03c0\u221a(LC)]).

The rectifier circuit in the receiver section converts this AC voltage in to DC and the voltage regulator IC helps to provide a constant limited regulated output voltage to the load for charging the low power devices. Here we are using LM 7805 voltage regulator IC.

We can now plug the LED into the breadboard.\u00a0\nAnother important fact about LEDs is the Anode always has the voltage going into it and the Cathode goes to ground. So we will want to place a jumper from the Anode to the 5V rail on the breadboard. Next we need to add resistors to the cathodes. Resistors are needed to limit the current flowing to the LEDs. Since we are connecting the LED to 5V we need to limit the current going into it otherwise we could burn out the LED. If we go from one cathode to the next\u00a0plugin\u00a0the same resistor between it and ground we can see that the different colors are not shining at the same\u00a0intercity.

The circuit is the same, but a new feature the \"pee and undress-light\" has added now.The PAU light in this case, are the two additional Nichia Power LED in the eyes, who can be switched separate on. So they work as non-disturbing light, when your partner already is sleeping and you had to leave the bed for goto pee (again) or came later downstairs and have to undress and put on the pajama without fire up the super trouper.The main light is, like in the can lamp, build with 4 Nichia 5mm Power LEDs where are strong enough to read analog books. The circuit is calculated that the LEDs draw @ 9 V ~ 75mA / each which is close to limit of 80 mA for this type. With 121 Lm / W (@ 80 mA) they are the most efficient LED you can get these days.

Now I'm going to build on that by showing you how to add a simple set of light sensors to the DP32 that will allow you to track a line.Let's get started!~~~~~For more Instructables on building cheap robots check out the For Cheap Robots collection, or for more things that I've done, check out my profile page!For more info from Digilent on the Digilent Makerspace, check out the Digilent blog!", "title": "Line Sensors for Cheap Robots", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Line-Sensors-for-Cheap-Robots/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "For this project, you will need the following hardware:The DP32 from Digilent.

I point out the difference between micro-USB cables and mini-USB cables in my Getting Started with the DP32 Instructable. Make sure you get the right one!A battery pack with bare connector wires. I like to use four AA or AAA batteries for my microcontrollers. It's right in the range of tolerance for most boards, and it's big enough to provide plenty of long-lasting power without being too heavy.Some electrical tape. You can also use duct-tape, but for this project, electrical tape will work better due to it's opacity.A small, flathead screwdriver. This will be used both for adjusting your potentiometers, and for screwing your battery terminals into your board.Scissors.Pliers. A thinner nose will work better for this, but my Leatherman pliers served me just fine.Wire cutters.It's very important to note that you want the leads of your LEDs and photocells to be as long as possible, because we will use these as structural components.and the following electrical components:Four resistors. 220 Ohms each (red, red, brown resistor code). It's important to point out that you'll only need two resistors if you only use the first set of LEDs.Two LEDs. I like red, but it's really up to you.(Optional) Two more LEDs. I picked yellow because I liked how they looked, and these will be almost purely aesthetic once you're done.Two phototransistors. I used 5k to 20k Ohm photocells.Two potentiometers. Mine were 10k Ohm.You'll also need at least two types of colored wire and a good set of wire strippers. I prefer solid-core wire. Normally the accepted standard is to use black for grounded wire and red for wire connected to power, but I'm running low on black wire, so I'll be using white for ground instead. It also helps to have at least two other colors of wire for this project, which will represent your right and left sensor connections, but that's not completely necessary.Finally, you're going need the following tools:A soldering iron.(Optional) A hot glue gun.

Now that I've finally found time to delve into Fritzing, I can finally provide a proper schematic and board layout! Yay!I've provided two pictures for the board layout, one with wires and one without, because it's harder trying to figure out exactly where everything is placed with all that spaghetti getting in the way. I'd also like to point out that while Fritzing allows you to apply surface wiring to breadboards, it doesn't have a good way of showing solder connections on the other side of the breadboard. With that in mind, I've added white wires to my board layout to show how things are connected on the other side of the board. Finally, for clarity, I've colored all my signal wires blue, any ground wires that go through a resistor are green, and then the direct power and ground lines are red and black respectively.For each sensor, we actually have three almost completely separate circuits running in parallel (and of course we have two sensors, so two sets of three circuits). First there's the circuit that I connected my red LEDs to, then the one my photocells are connected to, and finally the circuit my yellow LEDs are connected to.I'll start with the red LED's circuit, as it is the simplest. That's simply connected from the regulated 3 Volt line down to ground, through a 220 Ohm resistor to keep it from burning out.Next, I'll explain the yellow LED's circuit. This one is very similar to the red LED's circuit, as it's just an LED connected to ground through a resistor, but instead of starting at the 3 Volt line, we connect it to one of our board's IO pins. By setting this pin to \"high\" it acts as a 3 Volt source, and by setting the pin to \"low\" it acts as a ground. That's how we can turn that LED on and off.Finally, let me explain how the photocell's circuit works. This too starts with a connection to our regulated 3 Volt line. The photocell itself acts as a resistor, with variable resistance based on how much light hits it. The more light, the less the resistance. Then, instead of connecting it to ground through a normal resistor, we run it through another variable resistor called a potentiometer, or pot for short. By turning the pot's dial, we can change its resistance. With these two resistances in series (the photocell and the pot) we vary what voltage is being applied to pin 9. Pin 9 is special (same with pin 10) because it can be used to measure the voltage that's being applied to it. That's how our board can tell if it's looking at something light or something dark!

Always cut your wires longer than you think you need them. Once your wires are stripped, you can trim them shorter so they have the length you want, but it's much harder to trim a wire longer.It's also a good idea to give the wires a little bit of an ark. It make get a little confusing later on, but having this slack in your wire allows you to bend it out of the way of any wires you might want to fit in later.

This code simply turns on the right or left LED, if the right or left line sensor sees light (or more accurately a white, reflective surface). When you download it, however, it may not work straight away because some of your components may differ from mine, so you'll have to tune yours.There are two ways to tune these sensors, in the code or using the potentiometers. I'll show you how to use both.First, with your board connected to your computer, open up the Serial Monitor by pressing the button in the top right-hand corner of the MPIDE window (it's outlined in picture 1). You should start to see something like picture 2. These values represent how much light your right and left sensors \"see\".Place your board on a white, reflective surface. Watch what happens when you fiddle with the potentiometers on the front of your board. Depending on how you turn them, you can make the values go up or down. Now move your board over a dark spot, like a strip of electrical tape. Watch how the values go down.If either of the right or left values rise above the threshold values set at the beginning of the MPIDE sketch, then the corresponding LED turns on. When it dips below this value, the LED turns off. By adjusting your potentiometer, you can find a setting where the values you get for light surfaces is significantly higher than the range for dark surfaces. Then you can set your threshold value in the code to sit somewhere between these two ranges.Try it yourself!Note:I've gotten a lot of questions regarding why I chose visible spectrum LEDs for this, instead of infra-red LEDs. From what I recall, infra-red LEDs do work better, but the improved performance isn't really noticeable in my opinion.Using visible spectrum LEDs, however, does two things for us. First, these LEDs are much easier to get a hold of in large amounts because they're more prevalent in electronics, and they're sold in large amounts more often. The main reason why I did this, however, is practicality. Having done a lot of projects with IR LEDs, I can tell you that it's a pain to make sure they're actually working. Beginners (like I was, and still am from time to time) can and probably will burn out an LED or two, and with IR LEDs there's no way to tell if it's working unless you pull out a camera. With visible spectrum LEDs, you don't have that problem.Plus they look cooler with the lights off.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ5/C8PL/HZS8UUCC/FQ5C8PLHZS8UUCC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEK/B960/HZS8UXZ3/FEKB960HZS8UXZ3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ5/CHX3/HZS8V0OW/FZ5CHX3HZS8V0OW.LARGE.gif", "/assets/img/pixel.png"], "step_title": "Step 17: Programming, Testing and Tuning Your Board"}, {"step": 18, "steps_text": "Now that you've gotten your light sensors set up, try different settings for your potentiometers and threshold values!

This is far from Perfect but the way is ended up as far as design. Leaves a ton of room for future improvement. The head light can use a Cree Led in it and can fit a small heat sink on the back Also the headlight can contain the constant current driver inside it. The tail light can also host two Cree leds with a heat sink plate on the back. The battery can be upgraded to a 2S2P Lipo or Lithium-ion battery pack With a low battery indicator and overdraw circuit.

I don't believe infrared light can be sensed by a standard mouse eye though. (some higher end mice do have infrared LEDs)To find the right resistor without guessing, you'll need some good ol' evil- i mean... math.You have resistance (r), voltage (V), and current (I, uppercase \"i\")The resistance is measured in ohms, the voltage in volts, and the current in amps.Current = Voltage/resistance    -or-    I = V / rthe circuit in mice will usually be running at .02 amps.

Unfortunately I made it almost a year ago and I took few picture during the actual construction. Furthermore I did make hand written plans before building it but I threw it away right after that... So it won't be a \"follow the guide\" instructable. I just hope it will contain enough ideas to be useful to those who'd like to try to make their own.I made it using a aluminum tool case. The choice of high power UV LEDs makes it more expensive than the traditional ones we see here, so I wanted it to be good enough to suit me better than a commercial exposure box. The cool things about this UV box are:1 or 2 sided3W UV LEDs used, so no huge PCB needed to mount 5mm UV LEDs by hundreds, only a dozen per sidePowered by an ATX power supplyElectronic timer controlled through a rotary encoderRed LEDs to light the work area while aligning PCB and maskSensor to detect when the box is closedA cute status LED in the encoderMade it myself (well, that's the best thing, isn't it?)Electronics behind it was the occasion for me to try cool things like:SMD componentsSolder maskIt took me a week or two to make some exposure tests (to calculate and check distances between LEDs and glass, LEDs placement on the plate, etc.) and ways of powering it (I first used a Constant Current Voltage boost circuit, then a simple resistor per LED row), a week-end to build the case and assemble the LEDs, a week to burn them, then some time to receive replacement LEDs. I made 2 versions of the controller circuit so that took some weeks also... I have little free time and many projects that come to mind regularly so this project took few hours of work but a few months to complete.Ah, another detail: I'm not a native english speaker so my vocabulary can be limited when it comes to technical terms (in woodworking for instance), so please don't be too picky about that :)", "title": "Yet Another (ugly) UV Exposure Box", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Yet-Another-ugly-UV-exposure-Box/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I first cut a wooden plate to put UV LEDs (glued). My idea was to reach an A4 (21x29.7cm) size, but eventually I settled for a little smaller than that. I think I'll just never do a circuit larger than, say, 16x10cm which is a rather standard PCB size down here. After some tests I bought 3W UV (395nm) LEDs like this kind:http://www.ebay.com/itm/5-10pcs-3w-Bridgelux-LED-Heatsink-White-Blue-Green-Red-Orange-UV-Pink-/201134478354?pt=US_Light_Bulbs&var=&hash=item2ed48c9412The LEDs are wired in a 4 parallel rows of 3 LEDs configuration. My first idea to drive these LEDs were to use a constant current driver for all the LEDs, but it was a disaster as I should have expected: at some point an LED died, so the row opened, the constant current flowed in the 3 remaining rows, increasing the other three lines current, so a 2nd LED fried, and so on. In a fraction of second I had one dead LED on each row. And I suppose it could have been worst if multiple LEDs had burnt altogether. So after ordering replacement LEDs I just put a simple resistor on each row, that way each one is independently protected.I nailed a \"frame\" I made with wooden plates glued together with the plate and screwed the whole thing through the bottom of the case (yes, it's ugly) :)I used a router (Dremel Trio) to make space for the glass to come in.

I routed the lower frame for the squares to fit nicely, so that both pieces of glass would be in perfect contact. To compensate for the little imperfections and the presence of a PCB in between I added some foam between the glass and the wood. I used a light white foam but I realized I could have used some of the dense dark foam that was on the inside of the case (and that I partially removed anyway).I saw that the distance between the glass and the lower LEDs plate was less than the distance between the glass and the upper LED plate. To compensate I added a piece of wood to lower the upper LEDs plate before screwing it.Last but not least I added a piece of wood on the upside of the case to put pressure on the wooden frame when the case is closed.

It's more than enough anyway, so I'm OK with that. I took an ATX power supply from an old PC. Its form factor made it perfect to fit the case. And yes, the PSU installation is also ugly ;)On this picture the resistors per row are installed.During the development phase a mechanical switch was used to turn the LEDs ON/OFF with the +12V directly connected to it. Then I used a relay PCB to control the LEDs. I kept the switch to choose between 1 sided or 2 sided boards. By default (switch lever down) only the upper plate of LEDs is ON. This is because it's easier to see what you do when the mask is on the PCB and not the other way around. When the switch is ON, both plates are lit.If you want to use the ATX power supply check one of the many dedicated instructables to see how you turn on the supply by grounding the correct cable. I just put a jumper cable to ground it during the development phase but that's a bad idea, as it is always possible that you have a bad connection, or plug it on the wrong cable and burn your power supply.

Of course the timer switches off at the end of countdown.

I had a dual relays PCB attached to my circuit so I could just light red LEDs using the second relay if needed.I played it simple and bought an adhesive SMD led roll, which I placed all around the upper plate.To decide when to light the red LEDs I used a reed switch: when the case is open the UV LEDs stop (my eyes are grateful), and the red LEDs turn on. When the case closes the red LEDs turn OFF, but you have to use the encoder switch to turn the UV LEDs back on.Ho, also, when the case is open the RGB rotary encoder lights in red, but that's just for the beauty of it: after all the box is open so you can see the red lights are on, and anyway you can't see the encoder anymore :)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F1Q/JDBA/I4SCUJFA/F1QJDBAI4SCUJFA.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: A Little Touch of Luxury in the Box"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "I'd once writen a beautiful arduino sketch that worked a treat...

Our installers pull the fiber through conduit during the installation of the OR and need a quick way to verify that the fiber is good.

It was one of my first times buying online. I went on ebay and searched for a few weeks finding lots with blown bulbs for very cheap prices but bulbs were expensive so I wanted a working one!I finally found one marked as working with a bulb for around 60\u20ac so I bought it.After a long wait for me, being excited to finally be getting a projector it finally arrived and was soon in my bedroom. I turned it on and it had a great image! (one I still remember and want to achieve in the instructsble). But disaster soon struck, 60\u20ac was too good to be true, after a few hours of YouTube videos later the bulb light came on and the projector off!I let it cool down and turned it back on, it lasted another 10min before that red light of doom came on again. arrrh!It was bulb searching time, I went online and found the bulb for around 100\u20ac, too much for me, at 12 I would have been spending all of my money on a light bulb, it seemed like madness!I thought to myself: \"It's just a light bulb, why can't I use any old one?\"So back online again! I found a few people who had done it but there were no tutorials for my model so I followed the general rule of connecting the 3.3v to ground to bypass the lamp check and it worked! success!Now I needed a bulb, I didn't know about high powered leds back then and so this is where the project got stuck. I tried car headlamps, overhead spotlights and some others but they were never bright enough. Also I had a lot of trouble mounting them not having a drill or glue gun.So now we arrive today, the projector sat in a box under my bed for years and I never touched it until a few months ago.

The Y coordinate in particular changes strongly in this area (Figure 5), resulting in a non-true reproduction of color in the illuminated display. The LEDs also have different light intensities, which produces inhomogeneous illumination. Another problem is the required minimum supply voltage. A voltage well above 3V is necessary for operating the LEDs. Below that level, several LEDs may remain completely dark.\" \"A Li-Ion battery when fully charged provides an output voltage of 4.2V, which drops to a nominal 3.5V after a short period of operation. That voltage further declines to 3.0V as the battery discharges. If white LEDs are operated directly from the battery as shown in Figure 3, the following problems occur:At first, when the battery is fully charged, all diodes are illuminated but with different shades of light intensity and color. As battery voltage drops to its nominal level, the light intensities decrease and the differences in white become stronger. The designer must therefore consider the value of battery voltage and diode forward voltage for which the series resistor is calculated.

There may be a lower value fitted in commercial L.E.D chains but that is likely to be a factor of different L.E.Ds being used. 17.3 to 8.2 (delta 11.1mA for 12.8v to 10.8v)and that knowledge lead me to the following 3 options:It was obvious that if I was going to use 1.5v batteries then 3 would be required giving a voltage range from 4.8 to a proper 4volt end-point and a resistor of 150ohms causes a current from 12mA to 6.7mA (delta 5.3mA); 120R gives 15mA to 8.3mA (delta 8.7mA). This voltage option would be best served by a constant current circuit.With what has been learnt is possible to use rechargeables at 1.2v i.e 3.6v without a resistor as the L.E.D Rf is 38R and will limit the current to about 16mA (with,say,delta 7mA) and will simply stop working at 3v!If I use 4 x 1.5v batteries (because that is a more normal holder size) then the range becomes 6.4v to 5.4v and with 220R making a flatter current range i.e brightness change of 15.4 to 11mA (delta 4.4mA)The last option appears to be a good balance of brightness, brightness variation and long activity.In fact, the 4 cell option allows the use of using lower voltage re-chargeable batteries giving the added benefit of a near flat current dis-charge rate at 1.2v x 4 = 4.8v with a resistor of about half the value given, say 110R.I used three L.E.Ds in parallel to get a good coverage and brightness.Ref.1  https://www.instructables.com/id/LED-Throwies/  Ref.2  https://www.instructables.com/id/LED-Throwies/ ", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F1E/H1UQ/JOYNZ7SX/F1EH1UQJOYNZ7SX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ2/UAL6/JOYNZ7SU/FQ2UAL6JOYNZ7SU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: How Can We Use This Knowledge"}], "channel": "Electronics"}, {"category": "technology", "description": "There are lots of great LED lighting guides here on Instructables so I won't waste time on what they cover.

So it might be a good idea to do a dry run to make sure the LEDs are working and they fit properly. See the diagram for reference.I used LED Calc to help calculate the resistor I needed but I had to be careful what parameters I used.The batteries are NiMh 1.2V each which should equal 3.6V but the voltage of batteries that are newly recharged are higher than 1.2V per battery. The total battery pack value can be as much as 4.1V for 3 NimH AAA cells. This circuit is not voltage regulated so the battery voltage and therefore current will start high and decrease over time.To protect the LEDs from burning out you want to limit the current to each to 20mA and you should calculate your resistor value assuming the highest voltage case. First make sure you choose \"parralel LEDs\" in the option of that page.Then set the power supply parameter to 4.1V not 3.6V. The voltage drop of the LED varies but you can use 3.3V as an approximate.The current should be 20mA per LED. (* you can run some LEDs with more but this is a safe start)Your result should be 15 ohms.** If you plan to use 4 LEDs just change your LED quantity accordingly in the calculation.Disclaimer:This circuit was chosen because it uses the least number of components (one resistor) and is simple to construct. Our calculation assumes each LED has the same forward voltage but in reality they can differ by as much as 0.4V. A better parallel circuit would be one where each LED has its own resistor based on that LEDs forward voltage. But for the purposes of this inexpensive and easy project a single resistor design is adequate.If you have a multimeter you can take the opportunity to test the current through the whole system.I found it easier to just insert the LEDs backwards for now as shown below. Dont forget to use your resistor between the positive power wire and the positive terminals (longer leg) of the LEDs. You must make sure ALL LED legs are connected to the proper positive and negative wires otherwise you will send too much current to the lit LEDs and reduce their life or blow them out. I used alligator clips to keep the LEDs attached and touch the resistor to the red wire while its connected to the positive LED legs.Also make sure the batteries are FULLY CHARGED so that you can measure the highest possible current.

Upload the code and enjoy the brilliant lights!A few notes on RGB LEDs in general: Adjusting the hueWhen RGB lights are concerned, the code used to state the colors is typically formatted similarly in parentheses. There will be 3 numbers which you change to whatever color you\u2019d like, and typically a fourth number either in or outside the parentheses which is used to denote which LED you are changing. For example: if you which to set LED 13 to blue, you could write in: Strip.setPixelColor(13, 0, 0, 255);If you\u2019re having trouble getting the LEDs to light up correctly, check to make sure you added strip.begin() to the setup and strip.show() \u2013it sends updates to the hardware\u2014after setting the pixel colors If you want to change the overall brightness of the LEDs, you can add strip.setBrightness()You're now ready to use the Rainbow LED, or other RGB LEDs, for brighter projects!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F7O/LJYE/J9EGXA65/F7OLJYEJ9EGXA65.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP6/I0O2/J9EGXA66/FP6I0O2J9EGXA66.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Upload and Run the Code"}], "channel": "Arduino"}, {"category": "technology", "description": "so in this tutorial i will show you how to controll rgb led with android smartphone.
