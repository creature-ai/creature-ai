[{"category": "technology", "description": "Make a quality 3d (stereo gram) camera and viewer out of the iPhone, using a great free app that just came out. You take two pictures of the same subject. For the second picture, you shift the camera a little to the right (2-3 inches, or about the distance between your eyes).The two images are then mounted side-by-side next to each other. Using a special viewer, or uncrossing your eyes (what's called \"free viewing\") you can focus one eye on each image and your brain merges them as a 3D image.This simple instructable is to create a cardboard viewer, to make viewing easier.If you just want to view stereo pictures created by others (or by yourself using a computer), you can create this type of viewer with any smart phone, iPod touch, or other device which has a large screen. The iPhone is particularly good b/c of the screen size and resolution (also b/c it's a camera).Here is the home page for the iPhone / iPod app:http://ws.typepad.jp/stereomaker/And here is direct link to download on iTunes:Steremaker - iPhone app on App Store", "title": "DIY 3d Camera / Viewer With an IPhone", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-3d-camera-viewer-with-an-iPhone/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Find a piece of thick corrugated  cardboard in good shape.Cut out the holder roughly as shown using scissors or better yer an x-acto blade.

I have made small stars in small triangles at the back side of flower so that it would be easy to understand how to fold the flower.    One by one push all small triangles inside where I have made the stars and it will finally look like a flower.    Now make 4 semi-circles (two red and two white) of radius 3.5cm and cut them with Zig-Zag scissor.    Cut the semi-circle in half and paste them on the petals of flower.    Make a hexagon according to size of flower and paste it in flower.    Repeat same procedure and make another flower.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FM3/2V0R/JF8IQXCF/FM32V0RJF8IQXCF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5N/9BOI/JF8IQXA4/F5N9BOIJF8IQXA4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJS/WEFA/JF8IQXDF/FJSWEFAJF8IQXDF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6N/GAG6/JF8IQXE0/F6NGAG6JF8IQXE0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQS/EDKB/JF8IQXG7/FQSEDKBJF8IQXG7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBU/PE0O/JF8IQXJL/FBUPE0OJF8IQXJL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUP/VKFE/JF8IQXKX/FUPVKFEJF8IQXKX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUZ/JGXK/JF8IQXN0/FUZJGXKJF8IQXN0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5A/84ZY/JF8IQXPF/F5A84ZYJF8IQXPF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5R/Q2DP/JF8IQXRT/F5RQ2DPJF8IQXRT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1C/WQZL/JF8IQXSR/F1CWQZLJF8IQXSR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2Q/748B/JF8IQXSU/F2Q748BJF8IQXSU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF0/MG5W/JF8IQXT1/FF0MG5WJF8IQXT1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDG/VKZE/JF8IQY0J/FDGVKZEJF8IQY0J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEL/NVJI/JF8IQXXL/FELNVJIJF8IQXXL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZW/ANWW/JF8IOFX0/FZWANWWJF8IOFX0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNO/ZGK1/JF8IQY3X/FNOZGK1JF8IQY3X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRZ/JA58/JF8IQY7L/FRZJA58JF8IQY7L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSQ/U8OP/JF8IQY8U/FSQU8OPJF8IQY8U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNN/RJ1F/JF8IQY9P/FNNRJ1FJF8IQY9P.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3A/HJ2G/JF8IQYAW/F3AHJ2GJF8IQYAW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX7/5A2K/JF8IQYBM/FX75A2KJF8IQYBM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7S/FU4Z/JF8IQYCG/F7SFU4ZJF8IQYCG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYB/HF94/JF8IQYBW/FYBHF94JF8IQYBW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIC/MSPM/JF8IOFXJ/FICMSPMJF8IOFXJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3S/EYC0/JF8IQYDM/F3SEYC0JF8IQYDM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUY/2V2F/JF8IQYDY/FUY2V2FJF8IQYDY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTT/PW3V/JF8IQYEI/FTTPW3VJF8IQYEI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYL/SAAX/JF8IQYF9/FYLSAAXJF8IQYF9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAL/VH9K/JF8IQYFW/FALVH9KJF8IQYFW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD7/4469/JF8IOFYG/FD74469JF8IOFYG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH7/3WZR/JF8IOFYR/FH73WZRJF8IOFYR.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 12: CARD NO.10"}, {"step": 13, "steps_text": "Take a black card stock sheet and cut it into 30cm x 10cm (W x L) and fold it in half.

Paint a nice coat of dark red on all three of the gems, covering it nicely. Let the paint dry for a while, touching up some missing spots. Then get around the edges of the gems with the paint, letting it dry. Take some masking tape and cut some small strips, following the first two pictures of the diagram. Pour a little bright red onto the plate, and follow the first picture in this step. The masking tape will act as painters tape, preventing unwanted paint from leaking through to the other edges. Paint the exposed left inside edge of the gem bright red, once it's dried. Next mix a little white with the red, making pink. Follow the second diagram picture to align the tape. Align the tape to the top left corner, following the picture. Then lightly coat the inside exposed area with the pink paint. Once it's dried, gently peel off the tape to reveal a nice clean edge. Align the tape on the right side (refer to the first pic of the step), like we did for the left side of the gem. Mix in a little grey with the dark red paint, this will create an illusion of shading. Once the tape is in place, gently coat the exposed inside area with the grey-red paint. Once dry, gently peel off the tape.  Once again, align some tape onto the lower right side of the gem. Mix a little purple in with the dark red paint, again creating an illusion of shading. Once the tape is in place, gently coat the purple-dark red paint on the inside exposed area.

Of course you probably thinking \"I wish I could draw...but not that\" Point here is, with a sound approach and knowing the reason for each step, anyone, any age can begin to enjoy some success in drawing or painting in any medium.\nFor this demo I used\u00a0Sketchbook Pro 6.\nas a side note :\nI have recently upgraded and have been having a lot of fun with V6. I have had a copy of Sketchbook since version 1 but haven't really used it until the 2011 update came out. Been loving it since. I have always liked Sketchbook over other drawing software because it seemed to be smoothest transition from traditional to digital drawing and painting. It took a few updates for Sketchbook to get some of the brushes/textures and features I was looking for but it's all there now. So if you haven't tried it, download the free trial and give it a go.\nAs for my input device I am using a rather old Graphire 4 tablet....I am very interested to see what all the fuss is about with the in the newer Intuos5 touch Medium Pen Tablet is! ;)\nThanks for taking a look.\nMusic by:\u00a0 Michael Chapman & The Woodpiles\nEnough of the random thoughts, lets get started.Learning to draw from text, pictures or video is still like trying to learn how to swim from your couch.\nI have included a video and would like to challenge all you\u00a0\u201cWish I could drawers\u201d to get pencil and paper and draw along. Of course you can pause and replay. Be warned, you will show no signs of\u00a0improvement\u00a0by just watching it. Either way I hope you enjoy it.\nFor instructional purposes and in the\u00a0beginning\u00a0I recommend keeping these steps separate and finishing each one before moving on to the next one. As you become more familiar with each step\u00a0 you may choose to bounce in and out of steps in various parts of the drawing for a variety of reasons.\n\t\tRough Sketch\n\t\tLine drawing\n\t\tBlocking in base colours\n\t\tShadows and Highlights\n\t\tDetailing,Tinting and Toning.", "title": "Easy to Draw Halloween Characters", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Easy-to-Draw-Halloween-Characters/", "section": "craft", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I have also heard this called \u201clayout\u201d or an older term, \u201cscaffolding\u201d. I use to think this was merely a way instructional art books taught students how to draw, this is not the case. True, it may be a good way to show an object in a simplified form but it is not the sole purpose. Roughs can be useful in laying out multiple objects a composition, making sure the big picture is kept in mind right from the start. They can also be used to simply make sure the drawing will fit on the page.\nIn truth, here are many reason to make a rough but for this demonstration the rough sketch is used more to get out a loose idea for the purposes of discovering the character, placing\u00a0facial feature and simply laying a foundation to build on. Try to avoid \u201cundo\u201d or erasing at this stage of the drawing, the idea here is to keep moving forward and lay down something to work with. Be as loose or as sketchy as you are comfortable.\u00a0 Keep the lines light so you are able to build them up if necessary to define alterations.\nIf you watched the video you may have noticed that all of the characters were started with a head shape\u00a0boundary. When I am playing around with ideas like in this demo, I sometimes challenge myself with some random shape and try to make some character that come to mind from looking at that shape. Other times I will draw a grouping of shapes to make up the features and then draw the\u00a0head shape based on the feeling I get from the features.

At another level it could also be used to define shadow shapes and texture but for our purposes, let\u2019s treat this more like a colouring book. If you are drawing digitally, create a new layer above the existing one. You should be looking to use the rough sketch as a guide for the line drawing, however, do not feel bound to it, if you see areas for improvement continue to alter your character as you see fit. In other words unless you love part of your rough, do not feel the need to trace the drawing faithfully. If you have a better idea at this stage try it. If you are drawing digitally, all the more reason to try some ideas. There is always a few \u201cundos\u201d you can use.Hot Tip: Whenever you are trying to follow or trace a line, keep you eye focused on a spot just ahead of your pencil or if using a tablet, the on screen cursor. The longer and gentler the curve, the further you eyes can be. Of course this sounds a bit crazy, feel awkward, maybe even seem impossible but trust me, if you get the hang of this it is\u00a0awesome. It works great for more than just drawing. If it sounds\u00a0familiar\u00a0this is something I borrowed from driving and racing motorcycles. Your body has a strange\u00a0ability\u00a0to follow your eyes. The amazing thing is I find this work when drawing on a desk top tablet or drawing on screen in the case of my tablet PC I have a strange\u00a0ability\u00a0to account for the\u00a0parallax\u00a0that occurs due to the distance between the drawing surface and the screen. I even use the same technique to use a jigsaw and sewing machine for smoother more accurate curves. Try this, some people will\u00a0benefit\u00a0right away others it takes more time to get use to. Just remember you don't look at your front wheel to ride your bike.Some artist pay close attention to making sure the boundaries of all shapes are close, colouring book style, so the can take advantage of Fill or \u201cBucket\u201d tools.

In a traditional approach, care is taken to work the paint up to but not over the lines.\nIt is normal for it to look cartoon-like regardless of how realistic your line work is.Tip: Try and use the larges brush you can. This is not only quicker and more\u00a0efficient but in traditional painting it tends to lay down a more even coat or tone.

For this it is a good idea to create a new layer. If you are at you layer limit, dump your rough sketch layer. To create more of a painterly look this layer should be above the linework layer to start covering some of the out lines.\nNow before you start painting you will need to imagine a light source and where it is in relation to your objects.\n(A supplementary instructable here would be handy to explain lighting.)\nGeneral rules to follow here:\nDark colours/value recede or appear behind\nLights colours/value advance or appear to be on top or in front.\nMost often a primary light source is coming from above and somewhere behind you, the viewer. Curved surfaces will darken as the roll or turn away from the viewer simply put edges of curved surfaces get darker as the get to the borders.\nThese are of course a simplification of lighting principals but a lot can be accomplished by only applying these rules. In a simplified world of cartooning, this is all you may need to add dimension to your pictures.\nAs for highlights, they appear in the opposite parts of your picture, and as a general rule, your highlights and shadows should be separated by an area of your base colour no matter how thin that area might be. To say the same thing differently, don\u2019t let your highlights touch your shadows. Now let me just say I have distilled lighting principles into very simple terms and of course there is way more to it. By sticking to these simple rules anyone can experience some level of success with their drawings. That said, I have seen some amazing illustrations that used nothing more than these principles.Tip: Think about the texture of the surface you are working on. If it is hair try a brush that makes streaks. If it should look like a rough surface pick a textured brush. For smooth surfaces the air brush works. Also be mindful of how you apply the colour. If you are drawing hair, think about whether it is long or short, strait or curvy, your brush strokes should reflect that. Finally if you are digitally painting with pressure sensitivity, here is where I like to adjust my brush pressure to control opacity. If I am drawing on my phone with Sketchbook Mobile I reduce my opacity to 20-30% and build up the shadows or highlights.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FAM/12QE/H7NLY6I2/FAM12QEH7NLY6I2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ2/K6EE/H7NLY6I1/FZ2K6EEH7NLY6I1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL5/E5H5/H7NLY6I3/FL5E5H5H7NLY6I3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Shadows and Highlights"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Detailing is no more than doing the same on a smaller level.

I really like this idea because you don\u2019t have to learn anything more than the first few steps to make a picture with the appearance of complexity and detail.Tinting is an application of transparent colour to slightly modify base colours. Because of the simplified approach to shading and highlighting there is a danger that some of the areas are looking a little monochromatic, areas where the shading appears to only be lighter and darker versions of the same colour. In a way you could think of tinting as applying makeup. Colours are applied with low opacity to influence the other colours. (Rosey up cheeks or redden around eyes)Toning is often done done at the end. It is a global application of shadows. To be more specific, in can be used to give a subtle overall roundness to a head by applying in large soft transparent shadow in the form of a sphere. It can also be use to make some objects appear to come forward or sit back into the picture plane by a similar application of soft transparent tones.Tip: Continue to be mindful of texture, at this stage I often look to see how things are going, if it looks too rough I will tint and tone with soft brushes or\u00a0conversely\u00a0if the\u00a0opposite\u00a0is true.

it takes the wildly scattered bundles of light and only lets the ones bouncing straight off the subject and into the hole through cutting down on a lot of the backscatter. the finer the pinhole the

looks so cool.now im not going to go into microscopic detail on how to make a bellows cause ive already done that here..... https://www.instructables.com/id/EDITKGPCR7EP28788U/ ....but i did take some pictures and also came up with an alternate method to score the fold lines.heres a quick rundown of the stepsthe first step is to cut the sheet of bristol board into 4 equal sections.then you need to score parallel lines in it one half inch apart (this is to make it easy to fold)then you decide if you want straight or tapered bellows{stick with a straight one until you have made at least one}.measure how big your bellows needs to be and make your sides one half inch less than you need {the folds will take up the rest..there is a real danger of making your bellows too large for the box}lay out two adjacent sections side by side 1/2 inch apart but with the lines matching.using the hockey tape {this is the trickiest bit} carefully cover the joint between the sheets keeping them parallel .then turn the sheet over and tape the other side of the joint so you should have two sheets with a 1/2 inch gap covered in cloth tape{duct tape will not fold up correctly but it can be used in a pinch}.now join the third and fourth sides to the others in same way.when its time to close the fourth side to the first  place the tape on one side from the bottom or inside of the sheet gently position the other side then when its right and aligned press it down and put the last tape on top .now what you should have is a square box about 11 inches high by 7.5 inches wide and 9.5 inches wide.next you need to fold over one of the top edges turn the assembly 90 degrees then fold the next top in the opposite direction from the first one. once you have folded all the way around start on the next line down and fold it in the opposite direction from the fold above{i suggest you practice first or read this  https://www.instructables.com/id/EDITKGPCR7EP28788U/ } much better detail there reallythe new way i had of scoring the lines involves the paper cutter in the picturesit has deep slots at 1/2 inch intervals that are square with the top bar . by holding the sheets onto the cutter i was able to score the lines using a dead ball point pen as a stylus{the pen came back to life during this step and i made a mess over myself lol]. i dont think its likely many people will have such a thing but i thought id mention it", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSF/85TF/F4KCN91K/FSF85TFF4KCN91K.LARGE.jpg",

Safety Warning !"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "The captions in each of the 5 pictures in this step, studied with the written text notes below, should illustrate the key elements of this project.ISO 800Fuji Instax film is highly sensitive. Individual sheets removed from their original packaging, then very carefully slid out of their plastic, spring-loaded multi-shot cartridges must be handled in TOTAL darkness to prevent unwanted fogging (accidental exposure to light). You will need access to a darkroom or a changing bag, or some other suitable arrangement, and some means of storing your unexposed, loose sheets of Instax film.Motor driveThe pressure rollers which spread the processing chemicals over the film sheet are driven by a DC motor through a gearbox. I simplified everything by removing the unwanted lens assembly, then disconnecting/removing all of the surplus circuit boards and wiring (see safety warning above).Without the Instax camera\u2019s automatically-sequenced logic circuits, it is necessary to trigger the processing rollers' power feed manually, so the DC motor drive needs a simple push-switch wired in series from the batteries. I hacked one from a broken VCR. It is a push-to-make, momentary, normally-open type. Check that the polarity (+ and - volts) at the two electrical terminals on the rear of the motor housing will make the pressure rollers turn the correct way to eject a sheet of film from the slot in the top of the camera casing (I used some thin card to test them before I soldered the switch into circuit).DarkslidesThe Speed Graphic\u2019s 5 x 4 inch sheet film darkslides are too big to hold Fuji Instax film without it moving or falling inside the bellows when making an exposure. I cut small strips of card and plastic to act as guides and holders. This was the most precise part of the hack, because the relatively fragile chemical pod must not be damaged or punctured while loading or unloading the dark slide.OrientationThe light-sensitive surface of Instax film is the one with the full chemical pod on it. That surface must face the taking camera\u2019s lens when it is in the darkslide ready to expose it.When aligning a sheet of exposed but undeveloped film in the \u201cprocessing\u201d unit (which is what remains of the hacked Instax camera), the full chemical pod must be at the top near the rollers AND be face up (toward/under your fingers) in order to ensure an evenly developed result.You will need to gently encourage the leading edge of the sheet of film towards the moving rollers, lined up straight, until they grab it and pull it through (look at the added card guides in the picture of the inside back of the hacked 100). Then it will move smoothly forwards and exit them, which you will feel happening (listen carefully to the changing sounds which the motor and gears make). So, if you suffer from sweaty hands (for example when they're inside a warm changing bag), use thin cotton \"laboratory\" gloves or similar to avoid spoiling your pictures.Be patientDepending on ambient temperature, the image on an Instax film appears slowly over time, perhaps 60 to 90 seconds before anything is recogniseable. The picture continues to intensify for several minutes, sometimes taking a few hours to give the very darkest black (where/if any of that tonal value exists in a picture).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FG1/695K/JPN3MZ8H/FG1695KJPN3MZ8H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCA/XN5O/JPN3MZ7T/FCAXN5OJPN3MZ7T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F00/LIQQ/JPN3MZ8C/F00LIQQJPN3MZ8C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFJ/QN4L/JPN3MZ65/FFJQN4LJPN3MZ65.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKS/JL6F/JPN3MZ7U/FKSJL6FJPN3MZ7U.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Annotated Pictures"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "The black and white Instax film gives, in my opinion, a subjectively pleasing range of tonal values.

It's an open source project, and seems to be the go-to option if you want to do technical image enhancement without spending any money. Alternatively, if you'd like to use a truly professional tool, I'd recommend either Photoshop or Lightroom from Adobe. They aren't exactly the cheapest route, but if you invest in either of these highly popular pieces of software, you should be set for life. Finally if you're on a Chromebook, Polarr is a good option which emulates the look and feel of Lightroom. The steps in this tutorial are written with GIMP in mind, but it shouldn't be too hard to find the equivalent tools and menus in the other programs.I'll use the above photo taken on a 2013 trip to the Grand Canyon to illustrate each step in the workflow. This is a good example because we all know how this world famous landmark ought to look, with its layered walls of brown and orange rock towering above the Colorado River. The ground, sky and distant people in the shot are also framed in a way which makes the picture interesting to look at. This photo was taken using a Canon 1100D DSLR camera and the stock 18-55mm lens that came with it. Since I bought this camera, it has been improved and refined to become the 1300D. If you're looking for a versatile piece of kit at a decent price, I can highly recommend this product line from personal experience.A DSLR gives you immense control over every aspect of how you take your photos, and for night-time/low light shots I do like to make use of the ability to manually choose aperture, shutter speed and sensitivity. For most daytime shots though, I honestly tend to use the auto or semi-automatic (AV, TV) modes which let the camera decide most of these settings for me. I think my Grand Canyon image was taken in full-auto mode and saved directly to JPEG. You can also shoot in RAW with a DSLR, which will give you a higher quality result at the end of your edit, but the image file sizes will be a lot bigger. I normally take a large memory card with me so I have plenty of room to experiment. Here's a useful video which highlights a few situations when using RAW might be the best option.[If you decide to buy any of the mentioned Amazon products, I would greatly appreciate it if you access the listings using the above links - that way, I get a tiny share of the profits at no extra cost to you!]", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FNG/5TRB/JIYUA1G4/FNG5TRBJIYUA1G4.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Prerequisites"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "OK - time to start giving our test image a makeover.

A peak towards the right means that there are lots of very bright pixels, possibly telling us that the image is overexposed.The important slider in the Levels tool is right below the histogram in the area labelled Input Levels. There are 3 little pointers here which, when moved left and right, will drastically change the contrast and overall brightness of the image. You will be able to see these changes in real-time if you have the Preview option checked.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FHE/5LZH/JIYUA1G1/FHE5LZHJIYUA1G1.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Getting Familiar With Levels"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "The first things to notice are the gaps at each end of the histogram which tell us that the image contains no pixels which are 'completely dark' or 'completely light'.

You should be presented with the above dialog which again contains the histogram, this time showing a linear curve cutting across it.Note that the histogram looks different to when we first saw it in the Levels tool - this is because the changes we applied in the previous step have affected the overall distribution of pixels between light and dark. The concept of our new histogram is still the same though - it shows how the brightness of all the pixels in our image stacks up, with those on the left being 'completely dark' and those on the right being 'completely light'.So what does that linear curve across the histogram do? If you click on it, a node will appear which allows you to drag the curve into a new shape. If the Preview box is checked, you should see the image changing too as you drag and drop the node.

In practise, this means that dragging the left side of the curve down will darken the shadows, while moving the right side up will lighten the brightest parts of the image.If you click on the curve more than once, a new node will be created at each chosen point. They can all be dragged independently which lets you fine-tune which areas are brightened or darkened. A typical curve which instantly improves many photos is the S-curve, where the left side is pulled down, the middle remains in place and the right side is pulled up. As per the above explanation, this will darken the shadows, leave the mid-tones more or less the same and brighten the lightest areas. This is effectively what we did with the Levels in the previous step, so a full S-curve would probably be overkill here.Instead, we will use the curve to fine-tune any areas which we aren't 100% happy with after our levels adjustment.

More specifically drawing and painting, I was never very good at pottery or papier mache. I do love pretty much anything else besides sculpture in the art world. I have used tons and tons of different mediums and I love them ALL! Crayons, colored pencil, ballpoint pen, acrylic, oil paint, water color, chalk, pastels, inkwells, watercolor pencils and crayons and basically anything else you can think of. I love it all. Anything I can experiment with I enjoy. Colored pencil is the most fun, I think. You can just do so much with it. Not only that, but it is very helpful when learning how to shade. Just do a whole bunch of really light shading and slowly add more and more, maybe in different hues, depending on the drawing, Basically this medium is the best ever, in my very experienced mind. There are a lot of things you can do with them and it is a very wonderful medium. I am not a professional and am still learning , but I am very excited to show my process.   Basically the main thing to remember is that everyone has their own style and different techniques work for different people. As Susan Sauerbrun said, \u201c It takes daily practice and endless repetition of the same gesture, the same discipline and ritual procedure to achieve the mastery that finally allows an artist to create perfect forms without any apparent effort.\u201d (Artist\u2019s Statement, Painting, 64). I have taken tons of art classes, but I am not totally sure exactly what I am doing most of the time. Usually I just sort of wing it and explore and figure out the approach that works best for me. I am sure there are names for the things I do, but it is not something I am really worried about right now. Art is about having fun and expressing yourself. Though it is true that in the beginning of your art career, focusing on learning the skills rather than your own technique can be very important that way you allow yourself to discover what you are capable of as an artist and after that you can play with the different techniques and figure out your own method as an artisan.   I personally love, love, love Prismacolor colored pencils. They are by far my favorite may possibly be the best colored pencils on the market (that I have tried at least). What is great about them is they have a really soft wax that spreads really easily over different papers and surfaces. But beware about the softness of the pencil as they are known to sometimes clog up electric pencil sharpeners. Also the layers build up really quickly which is fantastic for that pretty, full coverage look you usually want with colored pencil drawings. What is also fantastic about these is they can be whetted down and used as a kind of paint or solvent in your picture. In his article Colored Pencil Product Review, Matt Fussell makes a good point, suggesting they could probably be their own separate art median.  They also come in tons of different colors and you can buy them individually or in a pack. And when bought in the case they come in a lovely tin case, perfect for safely storing your beloved art wands!   The only problem is they are kinda pricey. A good set of 132 different colored pencils can be in the mid hundreds for cost. Do not fret though as you do not have to use Prismacolor. Anything will work, you just may have to do a few things different, but you will have to anyway as you are discovering your own style and what fits best with you.", "title": "How to Draw With Colored Pencil", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Draw-With-Colored-Pencil/", "section": "craft", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": " Ok so let us get started!

Some people like to just go ahead and do a sketch of your chosen image onto the paper without any rules or anything. Usually that is my normal mode, but here I can show you how to do it using the grid method for a more accurate representation of the picture you chose. This may be sort of hard if you do not have some kind of light source.    If you think your paper is thin enough you can trace pretty easily, though, I would not worry about it.  Now you can either print out your image, or just use some technological features to add a grid to your image. On a piece of regular paper draw a grid with the same amount of squares, I usually just use a ruler and use the width of the ruler as the width of the squares. Number each side of your grid, just so it is easy to keep track of. Double check and make sure the grid on your photograph is the same number of squares and looks similar.   Next begin to sketch out your picture onto your paper making sure the lines match up in the squares. This may take some time, but try not to spend too much time on it as it will just be used to get the basic outline.   When it is all drawn out trace it onto your final paper. It should be fairly close to the original picture. If you do not have a light table, trace the backside of your outline with charcoal and put it over your final paper and retrace over the lines with a fair amount of pressure. This should leave a very light charcoal outline so you have a more accurate guide.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 2: Outline"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Ok so now it is time to start actually drawing. At the time I did this I did not have all of my Prismacolor pencils so I had to use cheaper brands for certain colors. Sometimes you will have to do this and it is a great way to experiment and refine your skills.   It is good to try and look at all the base colors and put those in first, but when I draw I kind of like to work with one part at a time and for me that helps keep it as close to the picture as I can.   I always start with the face. For me that is the part I enjoy most and it is so important to the picture.   I used a sort of grainy, brown paper because it makes the color really pop and it kind of holds it better, but the problem is that if you are using pencils other than prismacolor, it does not blend super well. I started by taking a light peach color by Colorray, and blocking in the face. Use a lot of pressure because you want it to cover as well as possible. Basically for the skin I used the light peach, a white Prismacolor and a brown Crayola. I ran out of medium browns so the brown I used is actually pretty dark so I had to use it very lightly and then go over everything with a colored pencil blender, which is basically just a colorless colored pencil; very waxy. This brightens the colors, and blends them very well. Sometimes I use the blender for white and black pencil drawings because it makes the pencil extra dark which makes for a dramatic effect when used properly.   Once the peach is blocked in, I started with the highlights, starting with very light layer of white on the higher parts of the face, her forehead, nose bridge, chin, upper lip area. Then I went in and added another layer of white in the middle of the already highlighted area, making for a little brighter look. next I used the brown and very lightly outlined the the nostril, cheek line and outline of her hair on her face and the indent between her eye and nose. Then I continues shading very lightly adding small layers. Again I went in with the blender. I also added a touch of orange to give her skin a more glowy look.   In the picture she had some kind of rhinestones on her face so I put those in after actually, but it might be better to do before. I lightly outlined the stones and colored them in with white. Then I took a light blue and outlined one side of both of them on the opposite side the light would be shining on her face.

I love doing makeup in real life and it was exciting to try and draw it. I started by taking a light blue prismacolor pencil and filling in the eyelid and directly under the eye. I then took black and outlined the lid and the eye itself then brought out the black as much as I could to create that smoky look. After I put in a light highlight on the eyelid.

The next strand was a little more complicated. It was much thicker so it was harder to just make look busy and shiny. I started by drawing sort of little double-Us up the strand in a sequence. Then, in between, I put in some browns and yellow to make it look kind of gold-ish and added some more highlights to try and make it more metallic looking.   The other strands were pretty similar.

Get your outlining color, I used black. Using the brush tool follow all of the edges. It may be a bit tedious but the final product is worth it. I've noticed the more jagged it is the better the picture seems to appear. I believe this is because you mind knows how the picture is supposed to be and if it sees a line where there would normally be a line it shows that and filters out the rest. This is just a guess though.Once you have a basic outline done your going to want to create another layer. This will be your color layer. Just grab your paint brush and paint solid colors. Don't worry about shading yet. Once you have the color layer done it's time for the shading. This is what makes you appear to have talent. Sure people with the artistic capability of a 3 year old can color inside the lines but how many 3 year olds do you know that can shade? This is what sets you apart from the rest of the runny nosed nap taking graphic artists.Now shading isn't as tricky as it looks.  What you want to do is look at your picture. Do you see a shadow? or a dark spot? Using your paint brush set to black with an opacity of 5 or so ish % just start coloring. 5% is just enough to make a slight noticeable difference. If it needs to be a little darker go over it again. I found the best way to fade the shading is to start where you want it darkest. Make your shade. Then go out a little and shade some more making sure to re shade the previously shaded part. Keep doing this till you get the center as dark as you want.Background. If there are elements in the background that you must have do the same procedure you did with the main focal point. Adding background elements however requires a small bit of talent. Proceeded with caution. Otherwise, and to keep it simple, use solid colors that blend or contrast the image.

It must be flat so you get the best seal possible against your project. -A good sharp utility knife. -A medium to light duty staple gun. -Sharp sharp fabric scissors. -Small hammer. -Blue painters tape, the wider the better. -A fine mesh material like the one shown. I believe it is a nylon drape. Any fine mesh that is sturdy will do. Silk is obviously the original, hence the name. I purchased mine from Jo-Ann's Fabrics for about $6 per yard.

You may have most of the things you need around the house.

(I recommend several since you will need more for multi-colored designs.) I used painter's canvas on pre-made wooden frames from Michael's. You can use old picture frames or make your own. The overall plan is to have a wood frame, 1\" or more thick, that is sturdy and absolutely flat on at least one face. It must be flat so you get the best seal possible against your project. -A good sharp utility knife. -A medium to light duty staple gun. -Sharp sharp fabric scissors. -Small hammer. -Blue painters tape, the wider the better. -A fine mesh material like the one shown. I believe it is a nylon drape. Any fine mesh that is sturdy will do. Silk is obviously the original, hence the name. I purchased mine from Jo-Ann's Fabrics for about $6 per yard. (It was 50% off at the time, from $12) The fabric was in the Home Decor section on a large roll. 1 Yard should make quite a few screens. (I have tons left over after making 2.)Then, to silk screen, you will need: - Silk screen supplies to include whatever ink or paint you want to use, a squeegee (Which can be improvised with many different household items.), and garments or paper to be printed on.

This insures that the fabric is fully saturated, but the then pushes the excess ink to the periphery. Once the ink is evenly applied to the desired area of fabric, the negative, toner side down, can be applied. I tried taping down the fabric with painters tape, but it was more trouble than it was worth. With the right amount of ink the fabric sticks perfectly to the acetate above and below it, making a fine vacuum like sandwich of acetate, ink soaked fabric and acetate. In order to get this you have to press out the last bubbles that have become stuck under the top layer of acetate. Work from the middle out, rather than pushing the bubbles in circles.

We didn\u2019t have the blueprint plans for any rebels to steal while making our CAT-CAT, so we needed several good reference pictures. After finding a bunch online we had to decide how big we wanted our CAT-CAT to be and how much fear we would strike in our enemies' hearts. We knew we wanted something around 3\u2019 6\u201d tall and as proportional to a \u201creal\u201d AT-AT as possible. Using our reference picture we decided that every inch on the pictured AT-AT would be 7\u201d in real life. For example, our reference roughly 4\" long legs, so that means our legs were cut at 28\u201d long. This turned out to be a surprisingly simple ratio, and we rarely deviated from it. This proportion also gave us just under our 3\u2019 6\u201d height. Since we wanted our CAT-CAT as realistic as possible, we knew we could not start at the bottom and build up. The way the hips articulate and attach, it would be easier to start with the mid body and build out from there. After the body, we made the head and then tackled the legs, being careful to keep all loose cables away so we wouldn\u2019t trip the CAT-CAT up (until the last step, of course). We attached the legs to the body and base and then added the feet. From there we started detailing and overlaying the ankles and legs, moving up and armoring the body. Finally, we detailed the head with overlays. All of this was designed and custom fit on the fly; we tracked our measurements and angles at first but quickly realized the futility of our actions - there are so many parts, angles, and bevels, and wood is never perfect. So treat all our measurements (if given) with a grain of salt and consult your reference pictures often. That said, one of our most common angles used was 15 degrees. If you have an angled piece you need to cut, it is recommended you start at that 15 degree angle and add and subtract degrees from there. So without further ado, let\u2019s do this!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FE5/QATP/JIOU3SWG/FE5QATPJIOU3SWG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Planning"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "First, we cut out the floor of our CAT-CAT main body. Find a reference pic that shows a top-down view. When you look from this view, you\u2019ll notice that the AT-AT tapers to the front and back. We cut out our floor in a rectangle first using the circular saw to make a rough cut \u00bd\u201d wider than the piece we needed. We then used the table saw to trim an \u00bc\u201d off each side to get down to our final width. Last, we used an arm saw to cut the length we needed. (We used this same combination of circular saw, table saw, then arm saw for the majority of our cuts; it helped us get the straightest, most accurate cuts.) We then marked out our tapers. They were short enough to cut out on our arm saw. If your arm saw doesn\u2019t have a deep reach, make the cut using a circular saw or lightsaber.            After the floor was cut we then built the frame for the hips and legs to attach. Using our reference we made this hip frame short enough to be hidden by the teardrop shaped hips, and proportionally wide - about 22-1/4\u201d long by 5\u201d wide. You won\u2019t be able to see very much - if any - of it when all the CAT-CAT details are added.            On the top and bottom of the floor find and mark the center line of both the length and width. Use the reference points often to make sure you keep everything symmetrical. Next, we centered the hip frame on the body floor and drew lines to mark where it would go. Then, apply a thin line of wood glue to the top of the hip frame. Place your body floor on the hip frame and press down and wiggle into place. (Literally wiggle the piece as it helps activate/set up the wood glue.) After its centered and in the place you want it, use the staple gun and add a few staples to hold everything together. The staples act like a clamp and hold everything together while it dries. Fill in the staple divots with some wood putty because next we\u2019ll start adding walls.            To make the center section walls we first cut out the plywood. Use your reference to find your height and width, and then rip a 1x2 and a 1x1 out of one 2x4. Remember 2x4\u2019s are actually only 1-3/4\u201d x 3-1/2\u201d because the Rebel Scum at the big box stores like to lie to you! Frame out one side using the 1x2\u2019s for the uprights (see pics for the orientation). This will be the wall opposite of the drawbridge door entrance. Before you frame the door side, make sure you measure, mark and cut your door out. We used a combination of an arm saw and scroll saw to remove the door. We eventually used that same cutout as the door later, so don't throw it away. Attach what\u2019s left of your door panel to the frame. Use a slightly wider board on the top to form a lip the door can close against when in its upright and locked position. Now attach your two walls to the floor. They need to go in the center section, right where all the tapers begin. Glue and staple the frames in, again using pressure and a wiggle to set the glue up. We used two staples in these pieces. If you hang the floor over the edge of your work table you can staple without having to flip it all over.            Are you feeling confident? Feeling like this is going well? Good, because now here\u2019s where the fun begins. The face and butt sections of the body not only taper down from the top and the sides, they also taper in less than a 90 degree angle. We played around with this a bit, and using 15 degree angle cuts and angles close to that, we were able to make walls and frames like the center section. Cut your plywood for the walls, and add in the angled frames to make it all as flush as you can. This is not for the faint of heart. We guessed, cut, and re-cut, taking just slivers of angles off until we were happy with how all the angles worked. For the front and back walls we intentionally inset them. We did this for two reasons: one it looks look that in \u201creal life\u201d, and two we didn't have to cut more angles to make everything flush. We also added a 2x4 behind the front wall where the neck will connect. Make sure you pre-drill and countersink two holes for the neck to attach to, as you might not be able to get a drill into the body later.Don\u2019t worry if you\u2019re not quite flush around the edges; that\u2019s what the wood putty is for.

While we wanted the CAT-CAT posed mid step as if to crush some rebel scum, we decided our cat's safety was more important and that all legs should be on the ground. We found a reference that had all straight legs and thought this would be the easiest and most structural configuration. Cut four 2x4\u2019s 29\u201d long. Then find a point centered and 14\u201d down from one end that we will call the top.  Use the scratch awl to make small hole. Put your compass in the hole and extend the pencil end to the edge of the 2x4. Then use this radius to draw out a circle. Keep this radius and mark it out on a scrap board or piece of paper as we use this radius for other details. Use that same radius to draw out a circle as close as possible to the top of the leg. You\u2019ve just marked the hip joint and the knee joint for one leg. After marking the knees on all, take the legs to the scroll saw and cut out notches to give the illusion of articulating knees. Next we get to make the hips. These are the teardrop shaped pieces that help the body stay level as the CAT-CAT marches forward to battle. For these we used the same radius we used for the knees on one side, and the other side was a small, metal coffee can. Use your reference and find out how big you want your hips and you can use the compass to draw the other circle. Then connect the lines so you have a teardrop shape. The small radius will eventually mount to the body, while the large radius will mount to the legs.             So let\u2019s do just that. First mount the hips to the legs. We countersunk and pre-drilled a 2\u201d wood screw. DON\u2019T glue this one in yet. We will glue after we level the body. Next, countersink and pre-drill the hole to attach the hips to the frame. Now were getting somewhere! (Get it? Because the legs are attached? No, okay.) Next we need to position the legs and prep them to level the body.            First let\u2019s cut out our base/pedestal. We originally wanted a 29\u201d x 48\u201d pedestal so the whole CAT-CAT had base under it, however, it was too big and we later cut it down to what you see in the final pics. We liked the  organic shape better anyway.            After you cut the base, place the CAT-CAT on top of it. Position the legs in the stance you want, and raise and lower the hips to level it out. Make sure you level in both the length and width dimensions. Then mark the orientation where the legs meet the hip joints; you will use this line later. Use a 1x1 (or ruler) to mark a straight line at the bottom of the legs. Remove the legs one at a time and cut  to make them mount flush and level. Then, glue and screw the hips and legs together using the marked line from earlier and attach to the body. Next, position your CAT-CAT on your base and glue and screw it in with the 3\u201d screws. It helps to mark the area from the bottom and top again, so you know where to position your screws. Now the structural work is over! Give your CAT-CAT a push; I bet a rebel snowspeeder couldn't knock it over! Seriously though, test out your CAT-CAT. Is it strong enough to support your cat? Even though Captain is more like Jabba the Hutt, the CAT-CAT was more than strong and stable.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FK9/2RFQ/JIOU3QYI/FK92RFQJIOU3QYI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FT7/HF22/JIOU3RZF/FT7HF22JIOU3RZF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRM/AYI4/JIOU3SKW/FRMAYI4JIOU3SKW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU6/PNEZ/JIOU3UVF/FU6PNEZJIOU3UVF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTQ/3WW1/JIOU3U1U/FTQ3WW1JIOU3U1U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZV/LHPJ/JIOU3VV1/FZVLHPJJIOU3VV1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0E/9VG5/JIOU3VK0/F0E9VG5JIOU3VK0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1D/XNFT/JIOU3VIH/F1DXNFTJIOU3VIH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV2/RQC1/JIOU3VBL/FV2RQC1JIOU3VBL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY0/NLU6/JIOU3U88/FY0NLU6JIOU3U88.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSU/9RMY/JIOU3UP8/FSU9RMYJIOU3UP8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FT4/0S9U/JIOU3VIP/FT40S9UJIOU3VIP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Legs and Hips Frame"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Nothing is more iconic than that first encounter with the Imperial Walker. You can hear the clang and thunder as it walks. A Rebel pulls out his macrobinoculars and sees the AT-AT's giant foot. The camera slowly pans up and the hearts' of the traitorous rebels sink down below their boots. We want to inspire that same amount of dread with all the details we put into our CAT-CAT. The details you add from here on out really help bring your CAT-CAT to life, and the results are definitely worth the effort. We started with the pads of the feet. First we ripped a section of 2x6 and 2x8 in half. Then, we placed the two halves together and measured out the radius of the bottom pad on the 2x8 using our reference picture. Cut out your four circles on the band saw, arm saw, or scroll saw. After cutting, use a belt sander or hand sander to smooth the edges as close to a perfect circle as possible. Do the same with the 2x6 and a smaller circle to give the foot the two-stack shape it has. Next, center the larger radius circles on the joint where the legs connect to the base. Mark and cut out notches with a jig saw or other saw so the foot fully surrounds the leg. Use a similar process on the smaller radius, making sure you center the small circle on the larger one. This is not how the Imperial Walker's foot connects to the leg, but we were willing to sacrifice looks for practicality and stability of the CAT-CAT. After everything is cut, secure the bottom circle with glue and screws, and the top with four brads or staples. Make sure you don't drive brads or staples into your screws.Next, we added the toes. For this we cut a piece of scrap wood on the table saw in such a way as to reduce the amount of end grain in the diagonal side. The longer the grain on the diagonal, the less likely your toes will break in the long run. We only glued the toes down.After the toes were glued on, we moved up to the ankles rockers. These have the same radius as the larger foot pad, but they extend straight down after a semi circle is complete. We cut our pieces out of 2x4's and made them longer than needed. Then we found a scrap 1x1 to use as a reference and held the rockers up to the leg and marked the angle. After cutting and fitting all 8 rockers, we countersunk a small hole and attached a small plug to look like a giant swivel pin.

We really felt like the layers added a whole new dimension to the project and the more we added the more our CAT-CAT took shape. I wont go into details on every bit of armor overlay as the process is almost identical with every piece. First measure and cut the armor piece you want out of the surply (primered 1/4\" plywood) . Next, sand down the edges to provide a clean edge. Then glue onto the CAT-CAT, with the primer side out. For small pieces you're done. For larger pieces consider using a brad or staple. Just be aware of what you're stapling into. Don't staple into straight plywood unless you have very small staples. Long staples and brads can leave sharp points inside the body, and I can guarantee your cat will not like that. So when you're done, ensure no Rogue Ones made it through to pester your Imperial Feline. You can really go all out on this step and I wholeheartedly suggest you do.

Some crevices are filled but others are left to look like armor overlay.Sand the CAT-CAT down one final time; we finished with an 80 grit sandpaper. We used the air compressor to blow off the dust and get in tight corners and then wiped down the CAT-CAT with tack cloth.Now it\u2019s time for painting, and let me warn you, you have about 7 hours ahead of you. As you might be able to tell, we painted the CAT-CAT in our living room. This is for three reasons: Missouri gets way too muggy and hot, and we didn\u2019t want the paint to dry funny. We personally wanted to be comfortable while painting \u2013 out of the heat and to be able to listen to TV. And sometimes you have to paint on your back, which we didn\u2019t want to paint for hours on the shop floor. Just make sure you lay a lot of cardboard and newspaper on the floor to keep it clean. Start by painting the under belly of the cat tower; this way, you can work from the inside to the outside and don\u2019t have to stick your hands in the drying paint. I used the 1\u201d brush for most of the CAT-CAT, the 3\u201d brush for the top and side panels, and the teeny brush for the small details (especially around the butt area). The first coat took about 4.5-5 hours. I would say, \u201cmake sure you let your paint dry before you start your second coat.\u201d But unless you\u2019re a Jedi speed painter, you\u2019ll probably be fine.

But we wanted more dimension. We considered using a Dremel to inlay the doors and panels, but we didn\u2019t want the tool to slip on the uneven wood grain and create an unfixable groove. Therefore, we used a black (we wished we had a dark gray) paint pen to add the details that we wouldn\u2019t be able to with wood. First, we started with the big side panels and taped up an AT-AT picture where we could easily access it. We then measured out the long lines, exhausts, escape hatches, and doors and figured out their distance from each other using the 1:7 scale. The lines were drawn in pencil as there is a lot of erasing in the beginning! Then you will use your paint marker to cover the pencil lines. Test out the paint marker and ruler on a practice piece first because the paint can sometimes run under the ruler (or tape line)! We had to use a ruler with a cork strip underneath to lift the ruler off the wood, that way the paint line was straight and didn\u2019t bleed underneath. In this step, you can add as little or as much detail as you\u2019d like.  And yes, we watched Star Wars in the background for mental inspiration. If you need help on your detailing, I'm sure your cat will sit there in the way and watch you work. At this time you can also add the red adhesive to the \"eye\" section and add the silver duct before screwing the head on. The red film is super easy to apply; just measure your eye space, leaving 1/4\" or so around the edges (framing the red), and cut with scissors. Peel off the adhesive and press in place. For the silver duct, we measured the neck distance and cut the duct with a metal-cutting Dremel wheel.

Honestly, ours would rather sleep in a cardboard box than a fluffy bed, so the pads didn\u2019t need to be thick. The top pad is easy; take the rectangle measurements (mine were 9.5\u201d x 12.5\u201d), add a half inch on both sides, and cut out two gray fabrics and one batting. Stack the layers - gray, gray, batting- and sew all the way around the rectangle, leaving a 3\u201d hole. Clip the corners and turn inside out. Lastly, stitch with an 1/8\u201d top stitch.             The inner pad is more complicated. I recommend taking measurements and creating a \"T\" pattern out of paper. Test the paper template before you cut and sew the pad, and follow the steps above to complete. You can use adhesive hook and latch strips (Velcro) to attach the pads to the CAT-CAT.            The Stormtroopers and Snowspeeder toys are created using iron-on paper. I printed out the desired pictures and then ironed them onto white fabric. I then cut out the Stormtroopers and snowspeeder, leaving a \u00bc\u201d gap, laid them onto their reversed sides, and zig zag stitched around the piece, leaving a gap for stuffing. I stuffed with poly-fil and then finished sewing the raw edges. To attach the stormtroopers on the inside of the body, I hot glued on cord and hung them from the ceiling. For the snowspeeder, I wanted it to look like it was wrapping tow cable around the ankles trying to take down the CAT-CAT, like Wedge Antilles did in the Battle of Hoth. To achieve this look I hot glued cord to the rear of the speeder and wrapped it from the back right foot around the front, and hand sewed on thread which attached to the door base.

I saw possible materials ranging from  black out cloth to paper to just paint on a wall. I decided to use none  of those things when I stumbled upon 8'x4' plastic wall panels at my local Home Depot.I  chose the plastic paneling in the end for a few reasons; ease of  cleaning (spray with any cleaner you wish & wipe), strength (paper  could tear easily, as could black-out cloth), it's light weight, and  most important, it's cheaper than any other method except the paper.", "title": "100 Inch Projector Screen for $20", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/100-Inch-Projector-Screen-for-20/", "section": "workshop", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "You will need the following materials:1/16 in. x 4 ft. x 8 ft.

It could also be easily cut with a razor knife or shears, the snips were simply the closest tool to my hand at the time.You could choose to leave it 8'x4' for an even more preponderant screen, or cut it to a specific aspect ratio and size if you wish. The largest 16:9 you can get from an 8'x4' panel is 85\"x48\" I believe.Also keep in mind that required ratios can vary greatly depending on your chosen media format. For example: HDTV=1.78:1, normal TV=1.33:1, DVD=whatever they felt like on the given day they made it; with some movies going all the way to 2.35:1. I decided that I could fit a decent sized picture within any of those ratios onto a  5'x4' (5:4) screen without an annoying amount of white space left over.I mounted it with four 1/2\" screws across the top, three across the bottom, and finally one on each side in the middle. I didn't bother with anchors because it's very light weight and has been in place for a few weeks now with no shifting.Hanging it level was a cinch to do solo, though an extra pair of hands wouldn't hurt.

It sounds like a great solution.\nIf you want to be cheaper, like me, for now, you can select a normal paint. \n--at this point I should mention that I found Home Depot more useful than Lowes for several things in this project - 1. they carry Behr brand paint and 2. they cut pieces of wood to length and sell it by the foot--\nI went to Home Depot and picked several paint chips from white to light grey. Some AV forums suggested Behr 'Silver Screen\" paint (770E-2). This is what I ended up using. When you have grey, it appears to be a better contrast ratio than white does. Also, I used a matte finish because it's less reflective and that's what you want. \nSo, I suggest picking up several different shades (make Silver Screen one of the options) and get a small stack of each individual color. When you get home, tape all of the chips of one color together so that it makes a square that is about 2-3 square feet in area. \nSlap them up on the projector wall. I used painters tape as an adhesive so that it wouldn't mess up the walls. Now, watch part of a movie. Find one with good colors and sections with good blacks. Do your best not to compare the white to the greys, because you may think, \"Oh, the white looks better compared to the grey.\" but remember that when the whole screen is one color you won't notice that.

You may come up with a better idea. I read in some AV forum that using black paint - even matte finish ends up being too reflective. \rThe schematic pic is my best depiction of how I laid out the plastic 1\" trim if the black material were not there. In the picture, black represents the wood frame, white represents the plastic trim pieces. \rCut the black material into strips that will cover the border area. I cut mine length-wise into 3rds and cut one of those pieces in half, which gave me four pieces the right size for what I needed. Do your own measuring. It's better to have too much that will just end up folded on the back. \rI folded my black material in half to make it thicker. \rThis is where it kinda gets tricky in the explanation...With this, again, I'm using the measurements for my screen. If you want a bigger border, you may do it a little different. It's important to look at the progression of the pictures along with the following steps. Also, hopefully, the image notes (yellow squares) will help this make more sense. \rStart on one of the sides (the 45\"/49\" sides)\rWith the screen (painted area) facing up, lay your black material about an inch inside the screen with the excess laying inwards toward the middle of the screen.\rStaple along the edge of the black material which will be about 2\" inward. \rNext, measure and mark all along the side at exactly 2\" in with chalk. Also, measure 2\" in from the top and bottom. \rTake a piece of 1\" plastic trim and cut it to 45\" long. \rPlace the inside edge of the trim to the outside of the chalk line (so that 1. from the edge of the frame to the other side of the trim equals 2\" and 2. from the inside of the trim on one side to the inside of the trim on the other side - once it's all done - equals 102.5\" for the length [or 45\" for the hight] of the screen). You'll also want the trim to be 2\" from the top and 2\" from the bottom.\rNow staple this trim piece down on top of the black material (basically over top of where you stapled the black material already. I stapled one direction for the material and then perpendicular for the trim so that I didn't hit any staples when I was stapling down the trim. Through this whole process, always make sure to tap the staples down with a hammer to make sure they are flush. \rYou can go ahead and do this whole process to the other side as well.\rNext, flip the screen over so that the back is facing up, then wrap the black material around to the back. In doing so, you are wrapping it over the 1\" trim, covering it up. Make sure the material is taut. \rStart this same process over for the length (Ultimately, the top and bottom of the screen). The only difference is that this time, you cut the trim to go all the way to each edge (each side). It's OK if you have to use more than one piece of trim for then length since it's all gonna get covered up by the black material anyway. The last picture in this step illustrates what this will look like once the material is stapled and you put the trim down, but have yet to wrap it around to the back. \rOnce you complete this for the two sides and the top & bottom, you're just about done. \r", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FG5/VV90/FCHYO85S/FG5VV90FCHYO85S.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU7/JTHN/FCEILZ8O/FU7JTHNFCEILZ8O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2C/EJ7Y/FCEILZ8N/F2CEJ7YFCEILZ8N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB1/648A/FCEILZ8M/FB1648AFCEILZ8M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0C/JLPL/FCEILZ8L/F0CJLPLFCEILZ8L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXR/OOXF/FCEILZ8K/FXROOXFFCEILZ8K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGM/WY1O/FCEILZ8J/FGMWY1OFCEILZ8J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FK6/HM75/FCEILZ8H/FK6HM75FCEILZ8H.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Add the Border"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "I'm not putting much here because there's many ways to do this.

When I watch content with 16x9 or 4x3, there is white showing on both sides of the screen not being used. To address this, I added black curtains (along with a black skirt) so that it covers up any unused portion of the screen (See pics below). The result is that the entire wall is either the movie or black. Another way to address the aspect ratio variation would be to create a 4x3 screen that was much taller, but still as wide as possible. Then, you could have a black skirt that you raise up for 16x9 content or 2.35:1 content. This way, regardless of the aspect ratio, your content will be as wide as possible on your wall.\u00a0\u00a0\nMake sure to have a party for the inaugural movie viewing. \nJust some final notes on how I (technically) only spent about $50 for my entire Home Theater setup:  \nProjector: \nOld multi-media projector - given to me. This may take some good social networking. My church replaced it's main projector in the auditorium and the old, obsolete one was just gathering dust in a closet. I asked if it could gather dust at my house. Once the bulb goes on it, it will basically be trash because the $300-400 that it'd cost for a new bulb will be half way towards a new projector with much better specs. UPDATE: With '08 birthday & Christmas money, I replaced the hand-me-down projector with a 720p projector. No surprise, the picture looks much better. I have also since added a built-from-scratch HTPC with Blu-Ray, HDMI out & Optical audio out. With Windows Media Center, it can stream Netflix & Hulu and also DVR over-the-air HD. I use an iPhone app as the mouse, keyboard & MC remote. I love the set up and maybe I'll make an instructable on creating an HTPC.\u00a0\nSurround Sound System: \nI looked in Consumer Reports for a comparison of models. The top model was a 7.1 Onkyo, but it was a receiver only. I already had a DVD player, but decided to go with a system that had a DVD player because the one I got is up-converting and has HDMI ports (a little future proofing). I went with the second highest ranked model in CR, which was the Sony HT-7100DH. I'm quite pleased with it. I got mine from amazon.

We used \"stain grade panel\" from Lowes which is actually Ponderosa Pine but was still tough enough for our purposes. (Pine is a softer wood, you may like to choose a harder (but probably more expensive) wood). However we used Particle Board for the back since it is cheaper and we couldn't buy wide enough Stain Grade Panel at Lowes. Note: We could fit the tallest (~72\") wood cuts in our small Toyota Corolla, in the trunk with the back seats down. 2) Enough \"two by fours\" (actually 1.5\" x 3.5\") to make the base. Take a look at the diagrams to see how much you need. We used Douglas Fir 2x4's because they are cheap (<$3 for 8ft long, if I recall correctly) 3) Coat hooks. We used a set of four coat hooks that come already attached to a board, from Lowes. You'll see it in some of the pictures. However you can use any hooks you like.\u00a0 4) Wood stain and/or paint (plus paint primer). We used a color called \"Celestial\" from Lowes for the back, and some \"Espresso\" (black colored) polyurethane/primer mix which was also from Lowes. You also need some paintbrushes (we used those things that are like a square sponge on a stick because it coats more uniformly), some latex gloves to keep you hands clean, and some turpentine to clean splatters of paint up. 5) Two sets of 18\" Euroslide drawer sliders, for the two sliding shoe racks. We used Richelieu brand from Lowes. 6) Table saw. We used Techshop San Jose. 7) Hand drill with drill bits and screwdriver bits. Also a fair number of wood screws. We had some 1\" long, some 1.5\" long, about maybe 50 in total (excluding the pocket hole screws which are mentioned below) 8) Several clamps to hold things together. I have four 2ft \"G\" clamps and two 90deg clamps, and this was enough. I show these in some of the pictures. 9) Wood glue. You'll use maybe 100 mL. 10) (Optional but recommended) Kreg Pocket Hole set and pocket hole screws (pocket hole screw length depends on what wood thickness you are joining. For the 2x4 wood, the screws should be 2-1/2\" long). If you haven't used a pocket hole set before, it The pocket hole set will make assembling the base (in the next step) a lot easier, but you could assemble it with regular screws or any other joinery technique.\u00a0 Note that I don't really know what I'm doing. This is our first wood project and I've just watched a few youtube videos on woodworking, along with some common sense. So if you're familiar with wood working I wouldn't be surprised if I am not doing things in the way a pro would do it.

This base is made from 2x4's. Assemble the 2x4's as shown in the pictures, using pocket hole screws. To see how to use pocket hole joinery, just google/youtube it. Basically: 1. drill the pocket hole holes in one piece out of the two pieces you are trying to join. Insert the screws but don't drill them through yet. 2. glue both sides of the attachment point, put them together, clamp it securely. Make sure you clamp it with a 90degree clamp if possible, to ensure that it is actually 90deg. 3. drill the previously-inserted screws in, so they enter the second piece of wood 4. remove the clamps Note that the CAD file shows some metal angled brackets underneath. I found that these were unnecessary as it was already strong enough. One other note is, there is one strange joint there. You will see it zoomed in and exploded in some photos in this step. Basically the reason I designed it this way is so you would never have to see the end-grain. From the front it looks like a 45degree mitered join, but from the side (which is not visible in the final assembly) it is clear that it is stronger than a 45degree mitered join because the flat side of one 2x4 is resting on the flat side of another. I actually created another separate instructable to just talk about this join -- see it here: instructables.com/____ Now just sand off the edges as shown, especially the side edges so you have a nice flat side to lay the side panels against. you have a kind of ugly looking stool!

However we were a little surprised to see that the dark stain on the yellowish wood somehow seemed at first to have a slight unwanted green tinge. However that either went away or else is not evident in indoor lighting as it appears fine now. (Or maybe we got used to it! :-) There are lots of other colors of stain too. To stain, you want to first set it up outside as the fumes can be bad. Brush it all on one face at a time, wait 5-15 min (5 min in sunlight, 10 min in cloudy lighting), then wipe off the excess gently using a cloth. Wipe in the direction of the grain. Watch youtube for more videos on how to stain wood. Note that while most of the panels are stained once, some of the panels we stained twice, on purpose, as this would give some panels the wood-like look while the others are jet black and it is hard to make out the wood-grain. See for example the top of the stool, which is lying down facing you in one of the pictures. There are two jet black panels with a stripe of single-stained panel between, which gave it a bit more originality than just being all stained the same tint. You do not need to stain most faces of the \"stool\" (by stool I mean the 2x4 assembly that goes around the shoe drawers) as only the front face and inside will be visible once assembled -- I show this in a picture. Next we wanted the back to be a bright color -- to \"pop,\" as my wife puts it. You simply get some primer and paint it on as if it were paint. You will probably need a second coat once the first coat has dried. The point here is to cover any black marks on the wood and the primer also sinks into the wood a bit so that the paint does NOT sink in. Next you paint it.

[Make sure to click \"SHOW ALL ITEMS\" below the pictures]First attach the top \"seat\" to the \"stool\"Next lay the back down on flat ground on an old blanket. Lay the \"stool\" on it. Lean the two sides against the stool. Now screw the two sides into the stool. (By stool I mean the strong part underneath where you sit to put your shoes on.)We have not attached the back yet, it's simply sitting on the back so we can align everything. Next attach the top and the top shelf, and the divider. Next, stand the whole thing up and attach the back. Note that this is the only step where more care has to be taken -- since you are screwing in to particle board, there is the risk of the particle board splitting or not holding tightly if too few screws are in. To combat this: (1) Make sure to drill your hole first, drill through both pieces so when the screw goes in it's not wedging apart the particle board but it's simply sliding in with the screw thread catching the particles; (2) Don't put a screw in closer than 2-3\" from the corner of particle board. Putting one in too close to the corner can make it split at the corner; (3) Put screws in every 6\", this seemed to me to be a good distance. Note that some of the wood was bowed outwards, so in one of the photos I show us clamping the sides together so we could screw into the particle board. We didn't have a clamp long enough but you can improvise as shown. Worked great and now there are no gaps.Last two items (1) Put the Euroslide runners on the sliding shoe shelf, then the complementary part on the inside of the \"stool\". Note that the sliding shoe shelf is designed to be 1\" narrower than the opening in the front of the stool, as this is required for the particular Richelieu brand Euroslide runners (0.5\" each side).  (2) attach the coat hooks as desired. We were a little concerned about the coats tearing out the hooks since the hooks would just be screwed into particle-board, so we cut another 2x4 as shown and then placed that as a cross-bar, and attached the hooks to that. Since the cross-bar is screwed not only into the back but also into the two wood sides, it is much stronger and will last a long time.You can buy baskets from target that fit in the square holes at the top, but we haven't bought these yet.

It all really started when I saw James Cameron's Avatar in 3D at the theater, but I originally had my first encounter with 3D when seeing an IMAX 3D film, \"Space Station 3D\" at a science center, I was amazed by the feeling of immersion and feeling almost as if I was actually there. Avatar was another one of those amazing immersive experiences, I made the mistake of seeing it at night and then going straight to bed after I got home from the theater. When I woke up the next day I felt like I had this crazy dream, while my mind was still fogged as it always is for about the first 10 minutes after I wake up, I thought it was a lucid dream, but then I remembered that it was a movie. I couldn't stop thinking about this movie at least once a day for the next month, I even heard stories of some people having depression called \"the avatar blues\" because this movie tricked their subconscious into believing this was a fully real-life place, but they realized that it was not real and they could never go to Pandora. Luckily I didn't feel depression, but I really wanted to be able to have something like this at home, mainly because it's just so frickin' awesome! So the google searches began and I settled on using 2 DLP projectors with circular polarization filters, I wanted to be able to use the industry standard realD glasses because the theaters let you keep them. A more broad term for my setup is passive-polarized stereoscopic projection. One of the biggest problems with this setup was to keep it cheap because I'm a nearly broke college student. Many people have been led to believe that 3D is \"new-fangled\" or \"very expensive\", it's not new, there are stereoscopic photos from the civil war! And we have had movies projected to large audiences using polarized systems since the 1950's! Finally I'm going to prove that it doesn't have to be expensive and the quality of the overall experience rivals that of any super-duper fancy 3D TV at best buy or the home theater store. or any single projector active glasses solution for that matter. Here is the big reason that pretty much all current 3D TV totally suck: They run a frame rate that does not match the source content in most cases, movies run at 23.976 fps (James Cameron and a few others are pushing for 48 fps and I love them for it, Avatar 2&3 should be 48fps per eye) and your 3D tv runs at 120 hz, so what does this mean? What it means is that the TV really wants 30fps or 60fps content so it can alternate the left and right images sequentially, \"LRLRLRLR.....\" and this gives you 60 fps PER EYE. Now, if you can see a CRT monitor flicker when set at 60HZ (I can) you know that it is awful! Your LCD runs at 60 HZ, so why no flicker you ask? Because it UPDATES the image every 1/60th of a second WITHOUT going dark in between frames. With an active 3D system each eye sees black half the time, what a rip-off! You pay thousands for a 3D tv and it will be black for half of the movie (I must acknowledge that film based projection in the theater has flicker and 1/3rd of your movie is just black, this flicker also bugs me and is why I'm not really into going to a non-digital theater). Alright, back to how we get 23.976hz converted to 60hz and for all intents and purposes lets call it 24hz, we use a dirty secret called 2:3 pullup and this essentially shows some frames for 2 of the 60 frames and for 3 of the 60 frames, 3D display is all about good timing and alignment, 2:3 pull up introduces a lot of judder in the motion and the problem is compounded in 3D different TVs handle it slightly different, but they all share a common problem: the timing of frames is mis-matched between your left and right eyes. Now before you yell at me saying that most theaters use 1 projector and have alternating frames, listen here. Theaters with alternating systems such as RealD, RealD-XL, Masterimage3D or Dolby 3D don't have these issues because they run at 144Hz which is exactly 6 times 24. They use a triple flash system and what this means is that for one stereo pair (1 frame of left and 1 frame of right) it alternates the left and right eyes 3 times each (6 flashes total) and then moves the next frame, etc... Using this technique, perfectly equal timing is maintained for both eyes and for every frame. TV manufacturers need to figure this out and they are idiots for not implementing the ability to do 144 HZ or better! The least they could do is to kill 2:3 pullup, there are many artifacts of the analog TV and film days and this is one of those and I HATE IT! I will never buy a 3D TV until they figure this crap out. IMAX uses dual projectors for their systems and I love them for it! A newer system is RealD XLS which takes advantage of the new 4k digital cinema projectors and uses a special over-under lens to essentially \"emulate\" dual projectors, just think about it, 4k imaging device and dual 2k pictures, lets do over-under! I can tell you that both of these systems rock! Alright on to the project!", "title": "3D Home Theater for Under a Grand", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/3D-home-theater-for-under-a-grand/", "section": "workshop", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "To start off, here are the main things I had to buy: -3 infocus LP-650 projectors DLP 1024x768, one was used for parts, you need 2 working projectors (must be DLP or other non-polarized projector) ebay.com about $500 total after getting el-cheapo chinese replacement lamps. brightness is key and matching the color and brightness between projectors is key, the polarizers will cut about half of your light, these projectors are rated at 2500 lumens and ended up being perfect for my 85\" screen I bet I could go up to 120\", but really need more resolution for that. If you don't count the fact that these are 4:3 and treat them like 16:9 projectors you are looking at a native resolution around 576p, it's not terrible and for the most part is the only weak link in the system. If you can, get a projector with LENS SHIFT, I cannot stress this enough, this will save you hours of headache in aligning your images, the LP-650 does not have this feature and it makes hours of extra work to align the images perfectly. -set of circular polarization filters (NOT AVAILABLE ANY MORE) polarization.com $25  I suggest contacting this company, I have not used them, but their filters would work: http://www.apioptics.com/3d-projection-filters.html -something to build a mounting rig or chassis out of, in my case, steel. also, materials for a screen (4 2x4's, sheet of masonite and paint). Lowes about $100 -stereoscopic player,  free demo limited to 5 minutes of playback at a time 3dtv.at 39 EURO around $60 (I bought it, this is the bet program and when paired with AnyDVD HD it will play 3D blu-rays without having to rip or convert it first) this program plays everything I throw at it and can use directshow codecs to play virtually ANY format. -FINALLY a computer with a mid to high power quad core CPU or the fastest dual core and 2 matching video outputs on the same graphics card, in my case 2 DVI ports, but VGA will work pretty good as well. My CPU is an AMD phenom II x4 3GHz and GPU is an nVidia 7950 GT. If you have to buy a computer you are going to have to pay over a grand for the project overall, but most of us already have decent computers, I hope. First, you need a way to mount your projectors and it must be VERY SOLID, any misalignment and I mean ANY, like more than a half an inch at the screen will cause headaches after a very short amount of use. I'm building my mount out of steel as I have access to a welder and other metal working tools. See photos. Take into consideration that you need to be able to move at least one projector in any axis and that you need to hold a polarizer filter out in front of the lens. A word of caution, keep your polarizer as far in front of the lens as possible to maximize the surface area that is used, it WILL heat up and melt if you put it too close, trust me. I cannot stress this enough, that you must maintain perfect image alignment, so take your time in building a good mount that you can easily adjust. A note on projectors: There are many types of projectors out there, DLP, 3 chip DLP, LCD, 3LCD, SXRD, D-ILA, LCOS, CRT and what ever type you choose, make sure the light output is not polarized (DLP) or you will regret it. You may be able to fashion a depolarizer out of at least 3 layers of quarter-wave retarder film, also from polarization.com, but you many get some slight color shift. A note on polarization: In my setup I initially used circular polarization like RealD, but switched to linear like IMAX (more on this later). The benefit of circular polarizers is that they are essentialy a linear filter and a quarter-wave retarder laminated together, which means you have a 2 in 1 filter. So you are ready for IMAX or RealD in the same system, all you need to do is flip the filters. Next, construct your screen, you could also paint directly on a wall if this is going to be more permanent installation. I will detail painting in the next step. You can also buy a silver screen, but a good one is going to cost at least $500!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FL2/X4L9/GTV9WIQ6/FL2X4L9GTV9WIQ6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBL/9O9P/GTUYA28W/FBL9O9PGTUYA28W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOA/PTUH/GTUYA296/FOAPTUHGTUYA296.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI5/EGPX/GTV9WIQ8/FI5EGPXGTV9WIQ8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX0/VODT/GTUYA29A/FX0VODTGTUYA29A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDZ/KR77/GTUYA2BH/FDZKR77GTUYA2BH.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: 3D Home Theater for Under a Grand - Getting Started"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The screen is a very important part and must be constructed and painted with the utmost of care.

After the black is dry you need to paint it silver, it is very hard to get a good texture without drips or blotches, you cannot rush this! You will need to do many thin coats to get it to look right. I had to do around 7 coats to get my screen done and it turned out as good as any commercial screen. To make this paint sprayable I needed to mix it with about 1/3 mineral spirits, I wouldn't want to try \"rattle can\" variety spray paint, the spray pattern is just not consistent enough, I bought a pneumatic sprayer just for this project. It is important to have a clean air source, a clean sprayer, clean paint (filter into the sprayer to get rid of any chunks) and no wind. One thing I would like to try is a curved or parabolic screen design to help widen the optimal viewing angles, silver screens by their very nature have a narrow viewing angle before you start to loose a lot of light.

Wood stain is similar to paint, but rather than leaving a layer of color on top of the wood, stain soaks into the wood and leaves the grain exposed. This allows us to darken the color of the wood, and still have a nice \"wood\" look. For my project, I wanted a dark background with a light contrast for the engraved image. I chose to use a dark walnut stain to achieve this goal. When we engrave the wood, the light mahogany will show through. The first thing we want to do is apply pre-stain wood conditioner. This will put a thin, invisible coating on the wood and ensure that our stain will soak in evenly. (This step is not essential, but will make our product look better). Part 1: Apply Pre-Stain Wood Conditioner:Put on safety glasses, dust mask, and work gloves for protectionWipe off wood with a damp cloth to get rid of any sawdust  Open the pre-stain wood condition with a flat head screwdriver  Use a 1-inch foam brush to apply the conditioner to the wood Cover all areas with a thin coatNOTE: Allow the wood to dry for at least 24 hours before applying stain Part 2: Apply Gel Stain:Put on safety glasses, dust mask, and work gloves for protectionOpen the can of stain with a flat head screwdriver  Use a clean 1-inch foam brush to apply stain to wood (cover all areas)  Allow stain to soak into wood for 5-10 minutes  Take a cloth and wipe off excess stain**Unlike paint, we don't want stain to sit on the surface of the wood. It is supposed to soak into the wood.Adding more coats of stain:You will likely want to add 2-3 coats of stain to achieve a nice, rich color as seen in my project. Adding another coat of stain, is just as easy as doing the first. The only thing you need to do is hurry up and wait! This part of the project will likely make you impatient, but you should wait at least 24 hours before applying another coat of stain. Once 24 hours is up and the stain is dry to the touch, repeat the steps in part 2 to apply another coat of stain.Protecting the prepared wood:Now that the wood is prepped, we want to protect it so the surface doesn't get scratched. I would suggest placing the wood in a cardboard box with foam or cloth to protect the surface. In my case, I did the prep work at home and had to transport the materials to a fabrication lab where I had access to a laser engraver and CNC router.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZK/0G2O/IZ6DCBKM/FZK0G2OIZ6DCBKM.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Preparation: Staining"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "This is the part of the project where you get to use some fun equipment!At this point, you have a nice piece of stained wood, but you want a heart shape. Sure, you could cut out the heart using a jigsaw or a handsaw even, but you can save a lot of time and effort by using a CNC router. This is a robotic machine that can cut out almost any shape perfectly. You don't need to worry about making mistakes!CNC routers are very complex and quite expensive. I used to work in a K-12 school district when I made this project, so I had access to our fabrication lab. If you don't have access to a CNC router, you could always cut out the heart shape by hand and then sand down the edges. Using the CNC router just saves us a ton of time.Disclaimer: These steps give a very high-level overview of the process and are not intended as complete instructions.

If you complete this project using a CNC router, I will make the assumption that you have proper experience, or have access to a trained professional who can help you use it safely.

I used masking tape so I wouldn't get smoke stains on the wood. If you look at the first picture above, you can see the difference between using masking tape and not. As the dust is sucked up by a vacuum at the back of the engraver, it leaves dark smoke stains on the wood. This can be a cool effect, but it is not ideal for this project.Once the engraver has finished and the laser has returned to it's home position, it is safe to remove the heart. Carefully peel away the masking tape and you'll be left with a really cool design! You may be tempted to call it a day, but we still have some finishing touches to do.

If your camera has this feature you are already half way to taking better backlit photos! The problem with backlit photos is that most cameras will be fooled by the bright background to under expose the subject of the photo in the foreground, making them dark and hard to see.If your camera will lock the focus and exposure settings when you hold the shutter half way down and keep it there (lightly pressed); this works to your advantage!

In further keeping with the budget operation code of fiscal responsibility, the chemicals used herein were mixed at home. Sensitizer To make a saturated ammonium dichromate solution, add 11.7g ammonium dichromate crystals to 88.3ml distilled water in a 100ml dark brown glass bottle.\u00a0 This ideally makes about 13.25%, but since we're dealing with a saturated solution, a good chunk of crystal will remain at the bottom.\u00a0 A little of this is a good thing, since it guarantees a saturated solution; however, too much is just wasteful.\u00a0 Tweak the amount of water added to minimize waste.\u00a0 As long as the solution remains saturated and exposure times consistent, results should be as predictable as can be expected, especially when so very much can go wrong.\u00a0 Mix thoroughly.\u00a0 Can be used as soon as solution clears.\u00a0 Mixed chemicals are obviously available online, but dry chemicals are cheap and easy.\u00a0 Dry dichromate crystals are very poisonous chemicals and look like candy.\u00a0 Be smart are about storing these or any potentially dangerous chemicals, especially in a home with children under foot. Gum Arabic To make 3:1 gum Arabic solution, add 25g (which is going to seem like an extraordinary *volume*) gum Arabic powder to 75ml distilled water in a glass bottle\u00a0 This stuff is ridiculous.\u00a0 Keep adding and adding, and when it seems more powder can not possibly be added, the water mysteriously dissolves all the powder and asks for more.\u00a0 Mixture will resemble thin wallpaper paste, but will clear with resting.\u00a0 Mix thoroughly.\u00a0 Make at least a day in advance. This natural extract of the acacia tree is a benign substance commonly used in chewing gum and candy manufacture. Next to pigment this is guaranteed to be a top expense if bought premixed at an arts and crafts store.\u00a0 Recommendation: buy powder in bulk and mix at home to save 75%. These are the only chemicals required and should be enough to make 60 prints, 20 sessions working 3 at a time.\u00a0 Each will keep indefinitely in a cool, dark location. Pigment Liquid watercolor pigments in tubes are easiest, though probably not the most economical.\u00a0 Powders are least expensive to use, but can be problematic in getting a thorough mix.\u00a0 Recommendation: stick with liquid pigments.\u00a0 When producing larger quantities of prints, purchase pigments in larger tubes (21ml).\u00a0 The fuel economy of the small tubes is pretty miserable. Obviously any color can be used for any layer, but this demonstration is designed to provide as clear an example of RBG-CYM three color gum printing.\u00a0 The \"standards\" for cyan, yellow and magenta that were used: cyan: Cottman phthalo blue 327 magenta: Cottman alizarin crimson hue 003 yellow: Cottman cadmium yellow pale hue 119 This is as good a place as any to explain pigment choices.\u00a0 When printing from RBG negatives, positive colors, i.e. colors negative to the negatives, are required to produce the final positive image.\u00a0 The red negative is used when printing the cyan pigment layer; the green negative is used when printing the magenta layer; the blue is used for the yellow. In this example, the pigment layers will be printed in yellow, magenta, cyan order, corresponding to the blue, green and red negatives, respectively.\u00a0 (You did label and stack them properly, right?\u00a0 Did you pass the quiz?)\u00a0 Paper One place not to skimp is in paper selection.\u00a0 So many watercolor papers exist from top manufacturers, it's hard to choose.\u00a0 For this example Lenox 100 is used...a 250g/m2 100% neutral pH rag paper.\u00a0 It has distinct differences in its surfaces.\u00a0 The \"back\" is relatively smooth with excellent tooth.\u00a0 The \"front\" has an undesirable texture for this application made to emulate the look of European mould-made papers.\u00a0 The back is being used. Lenox tends to shrink (A LOT), so before doing anything, the two sheets used here were sized in gelatin.\u00a0 Read about sizing; it is very important and quite necessary to this application. Get good paper, although it won't come cheap.\u00a0 Cotton, neutral pH, fairly heavy...something that will withstand a minimum of four washings.\u00a0 Size your paper to eliminate paper shrinkage.\u00a0 Yup.\u00a0 Good paper.\u00a0 Ain't no gettin' round it.\u00a0 A 22x30\" sheet of Lenox is about $4.\u00a0 Buy in bulk. To mix pigment for coating: In a mortar squeeze about a gram of pigment from the YELLOW paint tube.\u00a0 A gram is about an inch long line. Add 5ml of gum Arabic. Mix thoroughly with pestle until pigment is smooth and uniform. Mix some more. Add 5ml sensitizer to pigment. Mix thoroughly again until smooth and uniform. Mix for another five to ten minutes.

One of the best ways to have it is to use natural lighting. But what if you want to take pictures of your project to publish on instructables while sitting on your workshop? Well, natural light cannot reach everywhere and everytime. You can't just wait for day and for sunlight to reach your workspace. The only good option left would be to use artificial lighting. There may be several other options for taking photos in dimly lit areas, but they are neither not too effective nor too easy. When taking photos with artificial lighting, you have to make sure that they are powerful enough to provide good light. Most of the lights on eBay and Amazon are too expensive and high power consuming which makes them a work for only professional photographers. The price of most of them can rise to about $20-60 like this one and this one. The fact remains that they are helpful and provide perfect lighting to pro's in their studio but what should we do to take good pictures with cheap lighting? So here's presenting you a simple and cheap yet effective cardboard LED light panels that can be used to take perfect photos. The cost of each light panel is just around $5 so it easily fit in your budget. Each light panel contains 40 LEDs that provide enough light to take great photos. The panels also have the ability to control the brightness being free from the PWM system that interferes while making videos. The brightness of the panel is controlled by selecting the number of LEDs switched on. This is done using DIP switches that contains several switches in a single small package. Each of the light panels is powered using a separate 5v USB charger. They are much low power consuming than those huge studio lights which also makes them energy efficient. The materials like cardboard used to make it are simple and no power tools are required to make it. You just need some basic electronics and soldering skills which makes it a good weekend project and to get your kids started with electronics. This can not only be used for photography but also for reading and camping.Here is a video of the project in action: If you have any question related to this instructable, feel free to comment or ask a question. Do post your pictures if you've made one yourself.Please vote for me in all the contests by clicking the orange icon on the top right corner of the page if you like this instructable.Here are some features of this lamp:Is cheap. The cost of each light panel is just $5 which is much lower than studio lights.   Provides great light. An example is given above of the before photo (taken without the lights on) and after photo  taken with the lights on after a bit of editing).   Is energy efficient. Consumes very low current when compared to studio lights.   Is made using simple materials like cardboard, tape and paints.   Can be made battery operated by making some modifications.   Can be used in camping and outdoors.   Can be used as a reading lamp.

This causes problem in making videos which will defeat the purpose of this project. Using a potentiometer directly can also be done but that would be an unnecessary waste of energy. This method is much more energy efficient and will also control the intensity light by controlling the number of LEDs that will be switched on. Since there are 40 LEDs in total, there will be 4 sets having 4 LEDs each and rest 4 sets having 6 LEDs each.

Please note that I am not a pro so you can't expect much complicated things here.Have good lighting. This can be a difficult job but this instructable makes it easy! Natural light can be the best option to take good pictures.   Focus on the subject. Remove distracting tools and stuff from your setup that interfere in focusing. Focusing not on the subject can lead to blurry photos.   Edit your pictures if needed. Editing it makes them look far better than earlier.   Find a good background. Photos with bad background makes the subject look worse even if it is better.   Use the correct settings. Set your camera according to your surroundings and the amount of light.   Use a tripod if necessary. Using it really helps in taking steady photos.   Keep your hand stationary while taking a picture. Moving the camera can make the photo blurry.   Make sure that the ISO does not remain too high nor too low. Higher ISO make the picture grainy while low makes it dim.   Use flash if necessary. It really helps in taking good picture in dark but not using it properly can lead to bad images.   Make it simple. Photography is not rocket science unless you know some basic things.

It's 100% amazing and worth the money. It's available for iPhone and soon to be on Android!For the majority of my iPhone photography, I use three apps:Afterlight ($0.99)Camera+ ($1.99)Instasize (free!)Camera+ has replaced the normal camera app for me - it has more options, including an image stabilization feature that's currently missing for the default camera app on iPhone 4S/5C. It has loads of options to enhance your photos, but it's also just fine to use it without making any adjustments. Afterlight is great for tweaking photos! I use it for cropping, adjusting brightness and colors, and also for adding frames. The app also has a fantastic set of filters that are actually useable - they don't make the photos grainy and strange like Instagram does. Instasize is a great way to post full photos to Instagram and social media without cropping them into a square. So many times I take photos and love the way they look and I don't want to butcher them by cropping - and this is a perfect solution! As an added bonus, you can choose the color of the borders around your photo, but I tend to stick with white. :)Free (and awesome!) photo editors:Pixlr ExpressAdobe Photoshop ExpressLitelyPixlr and Photoshop Express are capable of creating very pretty and well edited photos. I haven't noticed any issues with pixelation when the images are blown up. :DLitely is not as full featured, but it's lovely for adding a bit of mood and polish to portraits - it's essentially just a collection of really beautiful film-style filters.If you want to add text to your photos, I recommend using one of these apps:A Beautiful Mess ($0.99)Rhonna Designs ($1.99)Typic+ ($0.99)The one major drawback here is that most text editing apps default to square cropping and/or can be a little clunky to use.A Beautiful Mess also has a hard time processing edited photos - I find that when I blow the image up it's quite pixelated.

It gets much dirtier than you'd think. I tend to just do the breathe on it/wipe it with my t-shirt method, but keeping a soft lens cleaning cloth around is never a bad idea.Have a pair of volume adjusting headphones on you. You can use the volume up button to snap pictures! Remove that ill-fitting case if you have one! Sometimes badly made cases can slightly obscure photos or leave a nasty color cast on the image. If you've got a wonky phone case, that might be part of the problem. ;)I don't use tripods or any other accessories for my iPhone photos, but they're out there!

Photos taken with smartphones can go super grainy in low light conditions - you'll lose most of your sharpness and depth of field in low lighting.You can adjust the lighting slightly when taking a photo - tap the screen in different places to move the focus and exposure. Another great trick is use the AE/AF (auto exposure/auto focus) lock function. Press and hold on the spot you want to expose and focus on - a yellow box will pop up and the words AE/AF lock will show up in a yellow box. Now you can move around slightly and still keep your focus and exposure right where you need them.

When you enable the HDR feature on the iPhone's standard camera, the camera will take three photos instead of one and then combine them to give you the best of the three images. (So in other words, instead of just having one area of the photo where the colors/brightness/contrast is great, HDR evens it out through the whole photo.)Check the photo above to get a better idea of what it does - the photo on the left was taken with HDR off. The sky is totally blown out and the colors are washed out overall. The wall to the right is very bright, too! On the right, HDR is turned on and the saturation is better for the sky, wall and flowers. With a little editing this photo will look much better than the original HDR off version. To get a more in depth explanation, check out this Lifehacker article over it. It's so good I don't think it's worth me trying to explain it in a new way. :DHDR is especially useful for portraits and larger outdoor shots - I've had varied results using it indoors for still-life style shots. Another thing to take into consideration is that if your shot contains a ton of movement, you should leave HDR off. Movement will cause lots of blurring and pixelation in the finished photo because you're combining three photos where the subjects are not in the same place.Also - don't use HDR if you want to take lots of photos at once - it takes much longer to process an HDR image, so the lag might cause you to miss something!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F30/R92H/HYPNX3D9/F30R92HHYPNX3D9.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Learn About HDR and Use It!"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Seriously.

Look at how clear the second photo is and how shaky the first one is! It's a huge difference.Instead of zooming in, try to get closer to your subject. If you can't get physically closer for some reason, take the photo totally zoomed out and crop it so that it's zoomed in where you want the focus to be.

A lot of the fun is in the 'reveal' and there is no embarrassment in making a very odd portrait. They all retain some charm. Tips: First of all you want your subject to be well illuminated so that you can see a bright image on the paper. You can go outside if it is sunny, or direct a spotlight at the subject. Secondly, you need to develop a very quick technique. If your subject moves, you will find it difficult to fill in the parts you missed. Ask your subject to sit very still and try to capture them in less than a minute. Maybe I will make another instructable on how to quickly trace a portrait!

The difference can be seen in the photos, the one with the moon My setup was Canon 7D with Tamron 70-300mm on a tripod, 2-layers filter; the camera was on manual and I shoot between f/10 and f/16 with shutter speed between 1/2500 and 1/4000, ISO around 1000. I shoot RAW 5184x3456 and also a sun-spot the size of earth was visible!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FAY/GIIW/IDQBPD37/FAYGIIWIDQBPD37.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTX/ZY57/IDQBPDE0/FTXZY57IDQBPDE0.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Taking Pictures"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "(Help me find a cool name!) I was looking for a practical way to filter sun's light for my eyes, and I made a rectangular cardboard frame with 2 layers of Mylar filter, but I still needed to hold it with one hand... then the magic idea, use sun glasses! Obviously a simple sunglass is not enough, so just cut few filter pieces (approx) the shape of your glass lens and tape them! Now you have super-cool Sun Glasses! In normal light condition you can't see, but when you point up your nose, ta-daan! With naked eye two layer were good but still a tiny bit too shiny, I found that with sunglasses lens it was absolutely perfect, if it's too much you can try remove the lens and use just the frame. Make Real Sun Glasses for the whole family, if you want you can let the kids do their own glass, scissors and tape is all what they need.Since you are going to tape the filter to sunglasses or remove the lens I would recommend doing it with cheap ones, maybe the tape can damage your lens treatment or leave traces ;) You can easily find them on eBay or Amazon for 10$.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFK/PKQA/IDQBPGTQ/FFKPKQAIDQBPGTQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYY/7H7A/IDQBPGKZ/FYY7H7AIDQBPGKZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU3/AZ9J/IDQBPGLC/FU3AZ9JIDQBPGLC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHO/06QJ/IDQBPGMO/FHO06QJIDQBPGMO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F11/5MFZ/IDQBPGQF/F115MFZIDQBPGQF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQK/Q9CH/IDQBPGUP/FQKQ9CHIDQBPGUP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQM/Q76A/IDQBPGV4/FQMQ76AIDQBPGV4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZV/W7ZV/IDQBPGVL/FZVW7ZVIDQBPGVL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDF/4T7R/IDQBPGKI/FDF4T7RIDQBPGKI.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Filter to Observe: Mod Your Sun Glasses!"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "If you are worried that your kids can forget their filter and start burning out their retinas, didn't find suitable filters, have no time, etc. or just wanna see something very cool, the Pinhole is just what you need!As the name the Pinhole is just... a hole, a small hole. I'm not going to explain how and why a Pinhole works, on the internet you can find tons of tutorials, explanations and so on, also Pinhole cameras exists, they are very fascinating and cool. A pinhole made with the finger is also a trick if you have bad sight, but this is another story. What happens with the pinhole is that the sunlight pass through the hole and project a circle with the moon shadow. It's super-safe because you are not looking at the sun but just at reflected light, the same you look at every day.##### WARNING #####The pinhole has no magic or special powers, it isn't a filter, just a hole, so don't look directly at the sun through it!###################You can use a colander that will project many small eclipses, the spaces between the leaf of a tree, your fist, you can cross your fingers, use crackers... anything has a hole!A cool solution is the camera obscura, but even cooler is a camera obscura with zoom! A camera obscura is just an empty dark light-proof chamber, with a pinhole.Just take two cardboard tubes, one a bit smaller that fits into the bigger one: by sliding them you will \"zoom\" the eclipse. Now we need to close the ends: one is for the pinhole, one is for the projecting surface. The pinhole cork must be made of something you can easily hole and that will keep it's shape. You can use some cardboard and a needle, or you can cut a small window on the cardboard and tape on it aluminum foil and then hole it. Or even some thin metal or plastic sheet and a drill or a hot-something. For the projecting surface you should use some light and thin paper, try different ones! Point it at the sun and zoom in and out the eclipse on the bottom of the tube.

On the MTO you might use the same method as in the DSLR but with such a big telescope it's better to make a light-proof cover, for example thick cardboard or light wood, cut a round hole not in center and apply the filter here.

Thank goodness for a well-stocked workshop. Plus, she's used to me spending all evening in the garage, so she probably won't notice if I sneak away to cobble something together. Fair warning, this gift is a bit of a risk. It will either be literally a hit or you will be sleeping on the curb. Know your audience.By all accounts (or at least both that I've seen), 50 Shades of Grey is a terrible film. I'm no movie critic (haven't even seen the trailer, so I have no basis for judgment) but I do know my wife read enough of the book to decide she hated it and grumble about what she called \"terrible writing and a blatant and dangerous misunderstanding of an entire culture.\" So save the price of two movie tickets and make your significant other this gift instead. Make it personal by getting creative with the word or design on the paddle.

But there's a range where things are still reasonably in focus. The size of the acceptably-focused region is called the depth of field. Now, I don't study optics and the factors that affect the depth of field are beyond my motivation to look up, but it's okay because we aren't going to use a lens.\nThere is another way to create an image, though. Instead of gathering the light with a lens, you block all the light that isn't going the right direction with a pinhole. The simplest cameras were just a light-proof box with a pinhole in it to project an image onto the film at the back of the box. They're really cool and I'd make one if I had photographic film. Alas, I don't.\nIdeal pinholes have infinite depth of field. Since they don't depend on the focusing properties of a lens, all distances are in focus. They do decrease the field of view and make the image rather dim, but we care about the depth of field part.\nReal pinholes have a non-zero diameter, so there are some limits to their depth of field, but in general, the smaller the aperture, the larger the depth of field.\nIn order to see the board from the back of our lecture hall, we're going to put a pinhole in front of both of our eyes.

The brands and techniques I'll be focusing on work well on untreated blonde to medium brown hair, though they will certainly apply to bleached tresses as well.If you choose to bleach more than just highlight streaks, I highly recommend going to a salon. A professional will be able to offer you products that are less damaging to your hair and will know the proper timing for the lift you need.  You'll also avoid coming out with a deep yellow orange base that may influence your end color result. You can still do your coloring at home if you find salon color cost prohibitive. The Big Dye Breakdown: Here are the pros and cons of the vibrant red/ pink dyes I've tried.  Weigh the experiences as they apply to your hair type and hair goals. I encourage you to read reviews of any hair color online before buying something.Manic Panic --Pros: great color selection, affordable at about $10 per tub. Fuchsia Shock, Vampire Red, Pillarbox Red, Hot Hot Pink, Infra red, and Cleo Rose all work well on unbleached hair. This color is also vegan friendly, if that concerns you. Cons: Best results achieved if you leave it on at least 40 minutes, which is not terrible but it does take commitment. If you shampoo 3+ times a week, fading will begin within 5 days. I find that Manic Panic seems to stick all over you after you get out of the shower; you're covered in a thin film of red that you don't really notice until you touch your keyboard and leave red fingerprints, or realize your shirt collars are getting tinted.  I also found this stuff will sweat off down the back my neck in the summer, so dark shirts are a must for at least the first week of color. Punky Colour --Pros: Uhh...really didn't find any.  Cons: Does not stick to unbleached hair very long.  Expect fade out within one week. Best used for accent streaks rather than all over color.Beyond the Zone Color Jamz -- Pros: Another dud for me.  Wouldn't recommend it!Cons: Literally had zero affect on my hair, even after being on for 30 minutes.  I looked the same after as I did before without so much as a tint.Special Effects --Pros: great color selection and results last a bit longer than MP colors, even on unbleached hair. Slightly creamier formula than MP makes application more controlled. Devlish, Candy Apple Red, and Cherry Bomb work very well.Cons: This brand is slightly harder to find an a little more expensive at $12-15 dollars a bottle. Also provides most vibrant results with about 30-40 minutes on your head, heat application a plus. Stains skin easily, so use protective garments or petroleum jelly to keep color off ears, brow ridge, etc.Ion Color Brilliance Brights --Pros: Right now this is my holy grail of color! Red and Magenta work very well on unbleached hair and last about 2 weeks with regular shampooing before you feel faded.  They're also readily available at Sally Beauty Supply for around $5 a tube (and often on sale for less), making it very affordable to stock up on.Cons: The consistency is VERY thick.  For a smooth application you'll want to mix with conditioner. The color selection is limited, but you can combine them to make a custom shade like I do and they periodically put out seasonal colors. This stuff wipes off skin easily if you get it right away, but does tend to stain your scalp for a few days. If you have short cropped hair, this may not appeal to you.\"Ultra Red\" Box Dyes (Feria, Garnier, L'Oreal, etc. Basically, any of the brands you can buy at a pharmacy that offer a selection of specialty reds)-- Pros: Easy to come by and typically longer lasting because these will be permanent dyes. Those with dark hair can expect to find products that lighten while coloring, so there's no bleach step in-between.Cons:Over time, these will seriously wreck your hair.  Before i knew better, I used to use box dye every 4-6 weeks and the bottom half of my hair felt like corn tassels. The \"super amazing fruit oil infused mega conditioners\" that come with the box will not save you. Use only every few months, or for root touch up, but do not repeatedly apply to your ends unless you're thinking of getting a bob soon. If you use box dyes, opt for ammonia free options like Natural Instincts as they are the lesser of the evils.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: Choosing a Colorant"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Since ICB is my recommendation for bold red, I'll be showing you how to apply it effectively and maintain your color using the same affordable ingredients.As mentioned int he breakdown, ICB is very thick.  You'll want to cut it with an inexpensive conditioner so you can make it more spreadable.  This helps you get more milage out of the tube and ensures you'll saturate every strand evenly.My preferred conditioner for this task is Mane n' Tail, available at Sally and most pharmacies. The beauty of this product is that you can get a huge bottle for about $6 and it really does deliver intense moisture without a lot of bogus additives. This is also a good opportunity to use up hotel sample size bottles of conditioner that you've been hoarding and have never actually used.Squirt a generous amount of conditioner into a plastic mixing receptacle.Add ICB color.  Squeeze from the end of the tube like toothpaste to dispense.1/2 tube for short hair, Full tube for medium-long hair.I like to mix \"Red\" with \"Magenta\" to get a deep red with a true red to pink base (rather than an orange red base), so I use 1/2 tube of each color per full head application to my medium long hair.Mix thoroughly with a tint brush until you have a cream color with no streaks.Apply to your head with latex or plastic gloved hands and/ or the tint brush. If you get some on your skin, wipe it away promptly with a towel (preferably a towel you've designated to the hair dye process and don't care about). Petroleum jelly applied to the ears and hairline will prevent dye contact with skin if you don't trust your application to be very precise.Best results on unbleached hair are achieved in 30-40 minutes.  Put a shower cap on to hold in the heat and moisture, allowing the dye to process without drying out. Go check Facebook, eat breakfast, watch an episode of something on Netflix.Rinse in the shower. Some frequent dyers suggest your first rinse be accompanied by a diluted white vinegar rinse to help seal in color.  I have tried this before while using Manic Panic colors and didn't notice any difference in retention, but perhaps this tip is best used on bleached hair.When you first get in the shower, it will look like you have just murdered the Kool-Aid man in there. Many dyes say \"rinse until water is clear.\" That will never happen. Rinse until the water is barely pink instead of full cherry red, then towel dry. Your towel will absorb the last of your run off. Pro Tip: If you dye often, invest in a dark towel so you never have to confront your stains. Guilt free living!A note on temperature: Most people suggest avoiding hot showers because the heat will open up your hair shaft, thus releasing more dye.  I hate cold showers, so I am often guilty of violating this.  Be mindful of your water temp and try dialing it back to warm-cool for your hair rinse only, to see if it makes an impact on your color's staying power.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FEX/2QHO/ICRXK6JH/FEX2QHOICRXK6JH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEB/0273/ICRXK6JI/FEB0273ICRXK6JI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMU/ONLX/ICRXK6KK/FMUONLXICRXK6KK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSB/1K08/ICRXK6K4/FSB1K08ICRXK6K4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN2/F7OC/ICRXK6MU/FN2F7OCICRXK6MU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3V/XL6R/ICRXK6NO/F3VXL6RICRXK6NO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMW/YUFT/ICRXK6OI/FMWYUFTICRXK6OI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAD/7F4Y/ICRXK6OJ/FAD7F4YICRXK6OJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBU/CFE2/ICRXK6PT/FBUCFE2ICRXK6PT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV6/THGT/ICRXK6WK/FV6THGTICRXK6WK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Ion Color Brilliance Application"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "A lot of beauty blogs will tell you the only way to keep color long term is to give up washing your hair more than once a week.  I'm a greasy little person and that does not work for me --not even with dry shampoos! The following are my tips to prolonging your color without having to feel unkempt or changing your daily shower routine.Shampoo Strategy-- Sulfate free products will not strip your color as quickly and are often advertised as color care products. Focus your application on your part and bangs, if you have them. These are areas that show grease the fastest.  Keeping your frequent shampoo applications restricted to these areas prevents all over color fade out or drying up your ends.  Every few days, do a shampoo application on the underside of your hair (back of the neck), to eliminate oil buildup there. Once a week, if you like, you can do an all over shampoo.Color Depositing Shampoos (optional) -- I'm on the fence about these, but they are available.  The best I have tried is Watercolors brand in Crimson Splash.  It does help replenish red tones in your hair with each wash, but it can also be drying if applied frequently.  Thoroughly condition after use.Color Depositing Conditioners-- I find this is the real key to long term vibrance, and it can only help your hair's overall state. The best brand I've tried is by far Overtone, which offers color lines for both natural reds and \"extreme\" bright red/ pink. Its color depositing capabilities are so strong that I've actually just straight up dyed my hair with their deep conditioner before. It is great stuff, easy to apply daily, and smells nice.  The downside is that it becomes an expensive habit at about $50 per conditioning kit. I have since decided to make my own daily color conditioner for less than a third of the price.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSM/7X8M/ICRXKAQU/FSM7X8MICRXKAQU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Maintenance Recommendations"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "I've been using this homemade mix for a few months. Since it uses the same two products as the original dye application, I can whip up a batch to have on hand in the shower anytime for under $5. Find a plastic container, either a tub or a bottle.  Make sure it is easy to use and cleansed of its previous contents.For a tub mix, squeeze in the amount of ICB hair color you would normally use for one full head application.  Again, in my case this is 1/2 tube red and 1/2 tube magenta.Cover with a very generous amount of your cheap conditioner.  You want a 3:1 ratio of conditioner to color. This filled my tub a little over half way.Mix until creamy and color is consistent throughout.  The color will appear a but more diluted than when you did your coloring batch due to all the extra conditioner stretching out the dye. *Bonus: Add a few drops of peppermint essential oil to the cream for some extra wake up zing in the morning.  This is just an option if you like the smell. It will not affect the function of the conditioner at all.*For a bottle mix, layer your products int he bottle like a parfait. Squirt of dye, squirt of conditioner, shake to mix. Repeat until bottle is nearly full. Don't wait until the bottle is full to do your shaking and mixing, because it will be very hard to get even color distribution at that point.Seal container and place in the shower for easy use every other day.  Apply a palm full to your scalp/ bans and another palm full to your ends. If you have longhair, you will get a more even distribution by loosely splitting your hair into pigtails and applying a portion to each half of your ends. Be mindful to spread it all around with you hands, working it through the hair evenly.  If you tend to slap it on your head in the same place every day, you'll end up with some places that are noticeable brighter than others (I made this mistake in middle school and earned the nickname \"Spot\"). Gloves are not needed unless you prefer it.  The color conditioner may stain your hands immediately after use, but it will go away by the time you're finished with your shower.Try to leave the conditioner on for at least 2-3 minutes.  Hold your head out of the water while you scrub your face or shave your legs to give the color conditioner time to deposit pigment. Rise and dry as usual.Following this regime will ensure that every day you shampoo or rinse out pigment, you are immediately re-depositing pigment to replace the loss.

So how do you create a base for it to cling to without  bleaching and without having to take a break from your vibrant red in favor of an all over lifting dye?My stylist had a smart suggestion for me. Obtain a bright \"natural\" red semi permeant dye that requires an activator with mild lift. For me, a developer level of 10 is sufficient. If you have previously bleached your hair you may end up using a 20 or 30.Mix the products as directed and then brush lightly on to your roots and fine areas like sideburns with a tint brush. If you wear your hair up a lot, you could also do the underside of your hair closest to the neck.The chemicals in the dye will lighten those areas slightly, making it more amicable to receiving your bright red hair dye in the future.  If you have white hairs coming in, like I do, these chemicals can also help straighten out their wiry texture. As long as you get a very bright natural red, like this one called \"Fire\", the color will blend pretty seamlessly with your extreme dye.  You've saved your hair a lot of damage by concentrating the lifting application only on the areas of new growth.Use this touch up dye as directed.  if the package says 15-20 minutes, do not exceed that.  Going beyond the recommended amount of time may give you unexpected color results that do not blend with your intense red.Should you feel the need to do a vibrant dye touch up but don't want to deal with all the hassles of a full head application, try this trick:Section off the top half of your hair, as you might for blow drying or styling.Pull the lower section into a loose ponytail, just to keep it out of your way.Apply a half batch of dye to the top section ONLY. Since this is the portion of your hair that most people see, this is really what matters. Apply, sit, and rinse as usual. ICB dye runoff tends to stain un-dyed hair it comes in contact with, so your lower section will still receive a bit of color deposit without the full dose mess.Depending on how faded you've allowed the lower section to become, sometimes you can even get an interesting ombre effect this way.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FXF/J7IG/ICRXK6S1/FXFJ7IGICRXK6S1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F04/JVXG/ICRXK6TB/F04JVXGICRXK6TB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXC/E8Y1/ICRXK6TC/FXCE8Y1ICRXK6TC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F90/DL1Z/ICRXK6UP/F90DL1ZICRXK6UP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGP/CA2I/ICRXK6W2/FGPCA2IICRXK6W2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4V/RAUG/ICRXK6XU/F4VRAUGICRXK6XU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Being Smart About Touch Ups and Roots"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "If bright red hair is going to be your thing longterm, I highly recommend buying a few dark towels, pillowcases, and maybe even a dark bath mat. No matter how meticulous you try to be, you are going to drip on something.  If that something is a gleaming white bath mat, you'll be kicking yourself.  The after effects hair dye can have on home goods may be especially important if you live with someone who is not an avid dyer and may get touchy about their linens becoming your victims. Even if the dye will ultimately come out in the wash, I find the dark towels that make the dye invisible keep everyone a little happier.Rubbing Alcohol is the best thing for getting rid of staining on skin. If your ears, forehead, or shoulders got stained, apply rubbing alcohol on a cotton ball and wipe. It may take several passes if the stain is dark, but it's effective and safe to use on your body. Just be aware that alcohol is drying, so you may feel the need to moisturize after.Cleaning Products: Before you fear that this dye job is going to cost you the deposit on your apartment, let me assure you that it will almost always come out.  Scrubbin' Bubbles is the best thing I've found for getting dye stains off of countertops and tile. Spray, sit, and rinse/ wipe away.  The color lifts away with the foam and even tough stains are usually gone within two applications. The quicker you address the stains, the easier they will lift.Soft Scrub or a regular diluted bleach wash will get the staining out of the grout in your shower.  That said, so will time.

Should you want to go back to a more natural (lower maintenance) look, I highly recommend using a semi-permanent, ammonia free dye somewhere between medium auburn and deep burgundy.A gradual transition will be healthiest for your hair and help you avoid unfortunate surprises in color results.   After a month or two of this bridging over, you're probably good to go in any direction you like.If you want to make an immediate dramatic change, like vibrant red to honey blonde, see your stylist for a consultation. They can put you on the path for best results and the least damage to your hair, and may have additional recommendations as to what you might want to do with your brows, new products to use in the shower, etc.  The good stylists will not try to gouge you with services you don't need!I hope this Ible has helped some aspiring Reds/ Pinks out here.

The amount of material you get depends on the size of your screen but since it is 4 way stretch spandex you can get away with some play. I got 2 yards and that was enough. I wouldn't get less then a yard unless you are planning on a small screen. Screen color: This is a good thing to think about. There a three basic colors for screens: white, gray and black. The only time you would ever use black is if you have a very bright projector with high contrast and a pitch black room. White is what most people go with (I think its because what people think of when they think of a screen) I am not a huge fan of white. Its great for getting bright white but you lose your rich blacks unless you have a very very dark room. I really like to use gray. It is a great middle point to get good bright whites and keep your rich blacks. It's good for dark rooms and lighter rooms. If you don't know just order a sample of each, sometimes they give them out for free.Since i am showing 3 ways of setting up your screen, materials and costs will vary.

Rods are used for night vision and they only let you see in shades of gray. You have only one type of rod but three types of cones. Cones let you see in color as long as it's not very dark.All three types of cones respond to a wide range of wavelengths, but one type is the most sensitive to long wavelengths (the red end of the spectrum), one to medium wavelengths, and one to short wavelengths (the blue end of the spectrum). With just these three types of cones, we are able to perceive more than a million different colors. When a red light, a blue light, and a green light are all shining on the screen, the screen looks white because these three colored lights stimulate all three types of cones in your eyes approximately equally, creating the sensation of white. Red, green, and blue are therefore called additive primaries of light. With these three lights you can make shadows of seven different colors\u2014blue, red, green, black, cyan, magenta, and yellow\u2014by blocking different combinations of lights (click to enlarge diagram above). When you block two lights, you see a shadow of the third color\u2014for example, block the red and green lights and you get a blue shadow. If you block only one of the lights, you get a shadow whose color is a mixture of the other two. Block the red light and the blue and green light mix to create cyan; block the green light and the red and blue light make magenta; block the blue light and red and green make yellow. If you block all three lights, you get a black shadow.You can achieve a similar effect by turning off different lightbulbs. If you turn off the red light, leaving on only the blue and green lights, the entire screen will appear cyan. And when you hold an object in front of the screen, you will see two shadows, one blue and one green. In one place, the object blocks the light coming from the green bulb, leaving a blue shadow; in the other location it blocks the light from the blue bulb, leaving a green shadow.When you move the object close to the screen, the shadows overlap, leaving a very dark (black) shadow where the object blocks both lights. When you turn off the green light, leaving on the red and blue lights, the screen will appear to be magenta, a mixture of red and blue. The shadows will be red and blue. When you turn off the blue light, leaving on the red and green lights, the screen will appear to be yellow. The shadows will be red and green.It may seem strange that a red light and a green light mix to make yellow light on a white screen. It just so happens that a particular mixture of red and green light stimulates the cones in your eyes exactly as much as they\u2019re stimulated by yellow light\u2014that is, by light from the yellow portion of the rainbow\u2014so your eye can't tell the difference. Whether a mixture of red and green light or yellow light alone\u2014whenever the cones in your eye are stimulated in just these proportions, you'll see the color yellow.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FPP/G7J7/JHATTQT0/FPPG7J7JHATTQT0.LARGE.gif"], "step_title": "Step 4: What\u2019s Going On?"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "If you let light from the three bulbs shine through a hole in a card that is held an appropriate distance from the screen, you will see three separate patches of colored light on the screen, one from each lamp.

Color OLED operate in 14 V, it means you need a dedicate step-up circuit, but it is not a problem if you simply use with a break-out board. LCD in most case can direct operate in 3.3 V, the same operating voltage as ESP32, so you can consider not use break out board to make a slimmer product.SoftwareSoftware support on the other side also influence your selection. You can develop ESP32 program with Arduino IDE or direct use ESP-IDF. But since ESP-IDF did not have too much display library and not much display hardware supported, so I will concentrate on Arduino display libraries only.For the beginner, I think buying adafruit (or similar vendor) hardware and using its Arduino library can have good seamless experience (though I have no budget to try it all).

It was a great idea and we had to make it happen.Note: Please excuse the lack of great process photos.I hadn't initially planned on doing a write up while I was making this.

Choose the CharactersWe chose Pac-Man characters for the family. Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, and the ghosts Blinky and Pinky. I wanted it to be accurate and authentic to the original 8-bit characters so I began by looking up the original game sprites.These help ensure we are getting the correct pixel pixel layout and shows each frame of the animations. For instance you can see the different frames of the ghost legs and Pac-Man's mouth in the sprites above. I then laid out each frame of the animations in Excel so we know where the number of LEDs and the overall layout of each board. The individual numbers of the LEDs are needed later for programming the Ardunio board.Number of LEDsThe Ghosts cover 170 pixels, Pac-Man is 137, and Ms. Pac-Man is 151, which means we needed 628 LEDs for the pixels. (170+170+137+151) Size of PanelsYou can see by the layout in Excel that the Ghosts are 14 pixels in height by 14 pixels in width. Pac-Man is 13x13 and Ms.Pac-Man is 14x14.Once we knew the width and height by pixels we have to decide how big we wanted to make the panels.  I wanted them all to be the same size relative to one another, so each pixel would be the same size on each costume. The strings of LEDs we purchased had a distance of about 3\" (75mm) between LEDs. This gives us the high end of how big we can make each pixel. To scale them properly we started by making sure it would be the right size for the smallest family member, my son. I measure him and held up some cardboard cutouts to see what was the largest size he could still comfortably put his arms over and still walk. We ended up at 22\" as the size of the ghosts in height and width, but you may want to do a different size. That set our scale of our pixels at 1.57\" square (22\" / 14 pixels, for the Ghost).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F77/MWCR/J9JFW1Z8/F77MWCRJ9JFW1Z8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFR/S5P5/J9JFW1LJ/FFRS5P5J9JFW1LJ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Planning"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "We wanted the costumes to be relatively easily to wear and not too terribly cumbersome, so we opted for light materials rather than durable ones.

You won't need your own laser cutter. You can either send it out to be cut by a company that does laser cutting, or you can go the manual route and print the PDF and lay it out on the cardboard and cut it by hand.The base is made from 1/8\" cardboard sheets purchased from the local art/hobby store. Our laser cutter has a 32\"x18\" bed so I had them cut the sheets down to that size. PanelThe panel is made up of a few main parts: the base, the slats, the cover, and the strap. The base holds the LEDs, the slate provide the pixels and overall stability of the panel, the cover diffuses the light, and the strap makes it portable. ModelingTo make the files for the laser cutter I modeled the base using Rhino. I modeled the all the parts of the panel very accurately in an effort to let the laser cutter do as much work as possible. I made each panel so that each vertical and horizontal fin would slide into each other and they would notch also into the base. Setting it up this way allows the parts of the panel to slide and notch together without the need for much glue, while also ensuring we would get perfect squares for the pixels. Notes:  The notches and joints have a 1/64\" clearance on both sides to let the cardboard slide together nicely. The slots end up being 5/32\" wide (1/8\" + 1/64\" + 1/64\").I have added the 3d model in DWG format to the files for those interested.Laser CuttingAs mentioned before our laser cutter is 32\"x18\" so the CAD files I made to do the laser cutting are set on that size. I have added the .dwg file for the Ghost costume. You can use it to laser cut your own, or you can print it out and use it as a template to hand cut the cardboard. If you are going to do it by hand you can easily lay this out and cut strips of cardboard. You can could measure it out yourself, the pixels are about 1.5\" square and 2\" deep with a 12mm hole in the middle for the LEDs. You can also use the provided PDF as a template for cutting. Notes: We used 12mm LEDs and that's what size the holes are. The LEDs went in nicely, but since it is cardboard they got a little loose, especially if I had to take the LEDs out and put them back in. If I were to redo it I would make those holes slightly smaller.AssemblyThe base had to be cut in two pieces since our laser cutter bed's small dimension is 18\", which is smaller than the 22\" x 22\" dimension of the base. I used good ole duct tape at the join to keep it together initially. This is really to keep it in place while adding the LEDs and slats. Once the slats were added to the base they provided the real support and stability. Each slat is labeled by scoring either \"H#\" or \"V#\" for Horizontal (H) and Vertical (V) and which number (#) in order. The slats slide together nicely since we added additional 1/32\" clearance. My first tests left a lot less room where they slid together and made it impossible to put it all together. Once the were all slid together we put the slats on the base. They notched in where the plus sign shaped holes in the base are. Once it was on the base I duct taped the slats to the base on the ends. Then I added a small bead of hot glue the top left corner where the slats meet to keep them in place and ensure they wouldn't slip.The notches for the slats extend through the base so there is a small tab on the back of the base. I also added a bead of hot glue to these tabs to keep the slats securely on the base. After thoughtAs you can see in the 3d model diagram I did not plan for an enclosure on the back of the panel. This was  a mistake! I noticed this a couple of hours before tick-or-treating and I hastily cut 2.5\" cardboard strips and added them to the back of the panel. to give something other than the LED wires to rest against the body. This helped, but really it should have been fully enclosed. When walking around with the panels with the back open the LEDs tend to get pushed in. You can see in some of the pictures where the pixels are no longer really pixels, but point lights. This is where the LEDs were pushed or fell in. I stopped the family a few times to fix these over the night or tick-or-treating. Note: If you are going to make these, plan for a back panel to enclose the LEDs. Don't make the same mistake.

I made a mistake and used a 8xAA Battery Pack with an On/Off switch that I had from the previous year's costumes. It was only while writing this did I realize it has a 12V output and I was using 5V LEDs. (I am no rocket surgeon but I think this is bad). Since I had the battery pack around I just picked it up and plugged it in and everything worked and I didn't second guess it  \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00afInterestingly enough the battery packs I used gave us only about 2 hours of on-time. After figuring out that they were the incorrect power supply for the panels I tested the panels with the correct 5VDC portable phone charger and they lasted much much longer. I tested a 2200 mAh and a 7800 mAh portable charger and the panels ran for 3h 40m and 12h 43m respectively. This means with a cheap \"lipstick charger\" you can get nearly 4 hours of on time. Note: The on-time I got from my test were with the ghost costumes (170 LEDs) running at 40 brightness out of 255 (The brightness is set in the code section)LEDsI used strings of 12mm WS2811 individually addressable LEDs for outdoor signage. I bought them on Amazon and they came in strings of 50. Since I needed over 600 I bought the 500 pack which came with a bit of a discount. WiringThe wiring of the power to the lights and then to the board is done as shown in the diagram and photo. The first LED on the string has a power-in connection. There are two wires (hot/red and ground/white). These are wired to a female power jack adapter. The power supply is plugged into this adapter. The 5V, GND, and DATA from that first LEDs 3pin JST connector/input port are connected to the 5V, GND, and 3 PIN connections on the Arduino board. Make sure you check your string of LEDs before wiring it up. My LED wires were Red(5V), Green (DATA), White(GND), but yours may be different.Notes:When using the USB to power the Arduino, unplug the 5V connection, but leave the GNDDo not mix up the 5v and GND - that can fry your board.

Maybe they will briefly blink. They need to be told what to do  first and this is how I did it.  I am not covering how to program  an Arduino board. If you don't know how to do this there is a great  article on Arduino's Website: Getting Started with ArduinoFastLEDI used the FastLED library for these. Its easy to use and easy to find examples to help figure everything out. It was useful that they use Web Colors so you can set any LED to any color by using the name. My Code Below is the code for the Ghost, I have also uploaded the Arduino code file.   The  basic outline for the logic is to fill all LEDs with the main color,  then change the color of, and turn off the individual sets of LEDs to  make each \"frame\". Once we have a set for each \"frame\" of the animation,  we loop through them at X speed X number of times to make up the whole  animation. There may be a smarter way of doing this, but this is how I  did it and it worked for me. Notes:  You can turn the brightness up and down it will have an effect on how long the batteries last.

You can get rolls of drafting paper at an art store or online. To keep the paper in place I put a line of regular old Elmers glue along the top edge of the vertical fins. I didn't do the ones horizontal ones as all you really need is for the paper to stay mostly in place. Keeping the paper glued down makes sure the grid read through and make the panel look like individual pixels. After you get the glue down lay the paper on top and put books or something heavy-ish on top to keep it in place and let the glue set. Once the glue sets you can cut the excess paper off.

Black and White photography is not simply a result of old technology of a bygone era. Black and white is a technique that we can still employ today to enhance our photography. With black and white photography, we are allowed to see the world beyond colors. With black and white photography, we can control moods. With black and white photography, we can highlight details we normally would not see in color. Ultimately, with black and white photography, it is a technique that can enhance our ability to tell our story through imagery. However, unlike color photography, many of us have trouble creating artistic or compelling black and white photos. Thus, this will be a beginner's guide to black and white photography. In this Instructables, we will learn to think in black and white, learn how to set up our camera, look at some examples of how we can use black and white photography to enhance our craft and lastly, we will look at some post processing tips. Techniques and opinions in this guide should not be taken as hard rules for black and white photography or photography in general. There are no absolute rules in photography, only suggestions. Experiment and see what works for you.

How do we do this? The following are a few areas to think about before you should click your shutter button.Light Learn how light works. Photography is the art of capturing light. Without light, there would be no photography. The basic light principles have been the same since the first cameras came about. A medium, either film or a sensor captures light changed over time. Seeing how light is hitting the subject wil affect contrast. Brighter environments then to provide lighter tones of gray to white, and the opposite is true, less light appears darker or black in black and white photography. Remember you can control light with your shutter, aperture, and ISOColor Black and white photos are not just black and white, there are many shades or tones of gray. Thus, when thinking about black and white compositions, remember that colors will be implied and exist. Colors could be used to your advantage. Color tones could be altered when converting to black and white. With the example image, the green moss is not present in the photo due to it being a dark shade of green. so the green blends in to the rocks. If the photo was colored, the rocks would not be as striking as the green moss will become more of a distraction.Contrast In black and white photography, there are no colors. Everything is presented as white, tones of gray and black. Try to see the world or find subjects with in terms of contrast. Contrast is defined as the difference between the tones. Photos with high contrast means there is a lot of white and blacks, but very little shades of gray. Low contrast photos appear mostly black or white with some grey. Most photos are just normal contrast with a mix of black, white and grey tones. How do we see this contrast played out in the color worked? Many photographers prefer high contrast black and white photos as they create a stronger subject. However, lower contrast photos can also be useful in softening the subject. The photo example is a high contrast photo. High contrast photos tend to provide very striking outlines of the subject. The black rocks are being outlined by the white mist of the water. Composition wise, the black rocks in the mist creates an atmosphere of mystery.Simplicity My opinion is less is more with the photo composition. Try not to clutter the photo with too many details. A single strong subject is easier on the eyes when creating a message or story. This is more true for black and white. A beautiful and vivid landscape will be various shades of gray in black and white and may be more confusing in black and white.Post Processing Have an idea on how you plan to process the photo since what you see when you take the photo, might not represent what you want as your final result. Have these things in mind and composing a better black and white photo will be easier. These are not all the things to consider about black and white composition, but its a start to get you thinking in black and white. Remember to practice and figure out what works for you.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FRW/DP4Z/GTW60BPV/FRWDP4ZGTW60BPV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Thinking in Black and White"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Take Color Photos Do not be tempted to just set your camera to black and white in the settings. Take the photos in color. Why? First, this will allow you more practice to visualize your composition in black and white without the aid of what your camera telling you how a monochromatic photo \"should\" look like. Second, by taking the photo in color, you preserve all the color tones, white balance and exposure. This will allow greater range of post process editing compared to editing an already black and white photo that came off that camera. When you take a photo in black and white, all the color tones will be discarded leaving less information for the post processing software to use. If you do not intend in editing your photos, then you can shoot in black and white.Shoot in Raw If your camera supports Raw format, use that format instead of the jpeg format. Just as shooting in color, raw format preserves more of the photo's information. Raw format is essentially the raw data collected from the camera's sensor with all of the camera's settings. This will allow a greater range in post processing. Jpegs are compressed photos, so many of the image's information will be lost during jpeg processing done by the camera. There are plenty of websites out there that shows how many stops of light or amount of color tones are lost during jpg compression compared to the raw format. All dslrs and some high end point and shoot cameras will allow this format. The downside to shooting Raw is that not all photo editing software supports raw formats. The image example was shot in raw and was a tad underexposed due to the window. Because raw formats preserve more sensor information, I can fix the exposure in Lightroom with the recovery slider. With this correction ability from Raw, we can see the contrast between the bright window and the dark stairs. Now that we have an idea of how black and white photography works, what are some things we can do in black and white photography?

The small bits of white in low key photos draw the viewer towards the subject. In this example, the harsh light hits the wall, and the light reflection reveal to us the contours of our subject. This is an easy way to create interesting photos at night without the need to run high ISOs or slow shutter speeds.High key is the exact opposite of low key. High key photos are predominantly white or lighter shades of gray. The darker areas draw the viewer to the subject for high key photos. High key in the example can be used for abstract art as a predominately white photo can be devoid of details. The focus can be on the abstract lines or patterns that are darker.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWW/0XCN/GTW65SRV/FWW0XCNGTW65SRV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2J/9250/GTXK84CP/F2J9250GTXK84CP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Using B&W to Create Low Key and High Key Effects"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Black and white photography at times can reduce elements that are distracting in our composition by controlling the light and colors. Black and white can also hide noise problems due to high ISO usage. Here are a few examples of what I mean. The first photo is a night of San Francisco from Pier 7. If you do a search of pier 7 on google, you will find a lot of photos showing the skyline and the pier. Some of these photos may appear cluttered especially at night with all the colors and light from the building. However, I wanted to take a photo that showed more of the pier. By underexposing and converting to black and white, the distant skyline fades into the background, but the light from the foreground lights up the details of the pier. You can see the planks on the pier and the slabs of wood used on the benches. The without the skyline as a distraction, we can easily see the leading lines created by the lights. In the second photo example, this is a photo of San Francisco from Sausalito. The clouds are moving in as if rain is coming. For this photo, i wanted the clouds to be the center of attention. By converting to black and white, we can really see the clouds pop out. Normally, when we observe a scene where it is about to rain, we see the colors of the water, the colors of the buildings, bits of blue sky peaking through the clouds. When we remove the colors and convert to black and white, we see contrast. The strong contrast between the rain clouds, white clouds and the sun cutting through the sky creates a situation of high contrast. The high contrast gives the clouds that stunning pop in black and white. For the third photo, we can use black and white to hide color noise. The photo was shot at ISO 1600. So there was some noise. By converting it to black and white, the color noise becomes a fine grain reminiscent of film. This can be a great way to create elegant low light photos while giving it a film feel.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FIV/0QX1/GTW60BPX/FIV0QX1GTW60BPX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F66/QJX1/GTQVPAW7/F66QJX1GTQVPAW7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0K/ICPW/GTXK851O/F0KICPWGTXK851O.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Using B&W to Reduce Distractions"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "While we saw that black and white photography can be used to reduce distractions, we can also use black and white photography to increase emphasis towards the subject. This is particularly useful with high contrast. The dark shadow of the coffee cup against the brightly lit chair allows us to focus on the cup even though the cup is off to the side of the photo. In the second photo, the great contrast between the white cat fur, the black eyes and the black background draws the viewer towards the cat's eyes and face. In this photo, a side light is coming in from the left side of the photo lighting the cat's white fur while the rest of the subject and background was dark. FYI, the cat was hiding behind a desk in the dark.

In our first photo example, I took this photo in a San Francisco park. \u00a0As the darker trees fade into the white fog, the changing shades of gray into pure white adds a sense of mystery to the photo. Whats beyond the fog? is a cliff or is it more trees? If this photo was in color, we might be more focus on the trail and the colors of the trees and not notice the encroaching mysterious fog. \u00a0To enhance this photo some more, i reduced the exposure. \u00a0If we took the photo in color with a reduced exposure by a stop or two, we might have color detail lost in the dark areas. \u00a0This can be hidden in black and white photos and be used to our advantage. In our second example, using a low key effect, we add mystery to the car. The glow of the headlights draws our eyes in and the ambient lighting outlines the car's body, yet it is dark and we wonder what the car is up to. The low key look with the glow of the headlights gives the car a menacing feel. We are not sure whats going on, but we are curious about the car. \u00a0Additional vignetting was adding in during post processing to help create more focus and mystery.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FE9/3RE0/GTW60BPT/FE93RE0GTW60BPT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9W/FWK4/GTW60BPP/F9WFWK4GTW60BPP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Using B&W to Create Mystery"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "With only black and white contrasts, we can reveal the details, textures and patterns that was lost in color. We see the first example photo is of the beach. Specifically, ripples of sand. While walking around, we will normally notice these ripples, but in color, these ripples do not stand out as much. What we see in color are shades of yellow from the sand. In black and white, the darker gray shades stand out a lot more than color. This contrast can be further enhance with post processing. We see from the photo, the ripples are very prominently displayed. We see here, the patterns, details and the textures of the sand was brought out with black and white processing. In the second photo, we see tentacles. The high contrast of the suction cups reveal to us the roundness of the cup. When devoid of colors, we do not notice the rest of the tentacle but only the cups. The rest of the tentcle fades into the gray and black. In the third photo, by controlling the lighting, we can see the textures on the face.

The example photo was taken from Lightroom, similar controls could be found in other post processing software. We will go through each setting and what you can do with it to improve your black and white photos. The Lightroom settings you see correspond to the night photo of the Palace of Fine Arts. The photo was taken in Raw format with a Canon Powershot s95 point and shoot.Histogram The histogram shows the distribution of tones. The left side is black, and the right side is white, the middle is gray. In the example, most of the photo is of darker shades. You can use this tool to monitor your distribution when you start editing.Treatment The treatment is the type of photo you are editing, either in color or black and white. I prefer changing the treatment to black and white. You also create a black and white by desaturating, but thats not truly black and white as the color information is not being discarded. Some programs call this feature \"gray scale\".White Balance While the photo is black and white, adjusting the white balance will still affect the photo. As with color photos, adjusting the white balance will alter the tones of gray. You can play with this to adjust your gray shades or tones if you like. I did not adjust WB in my example.Exposure Similar to color photos, adjusting exposure alters the lighting in the black and white photo. Exposure has a lot of ability to alter the contrast of a photo. Using the exposure can easily allow you to enhance low key or high key photos. I liked the overall exposure so I did not adjust the exposure in my example.Recovery Recovery allows you to bring back highlight detail. This can be great if your camera over exposed something you didnt want to over expose. This works even more effectively in black and white in my opinion than in color. Recovery at times in color seems understated, but in black and white, you can see the details come back right away. Since this was a night photo, and I wanted to display some of the details of the Place of Fine Arts, I adjusted the recovery to bring back some details due to the bright lights.Fill light and Blacks These two sliders can help you add more light or blacks to your photo. Both of these can greatly increase or degrease the contrast of the photo. As you can see, I adjusted both the blacks and fill light to increase contrast.Brightness You can play with this to brighten up your photo. I do not usually move this slider too much in black and white as the photos can easily wash out.Contrast This slider is self explanatory, increase contrast on the slider will increase contrast in photo. I increased the contrast to the maximum to really allow me to show the details of my subject.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FUR/7RZT/GTXK84V8/FUR7RZTGTXK84V8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4M/TWJ9/GTXKDD48/F4MTWJ9GTXKDD48.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Basic Post Processing"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "In conclusion, we see that light, colors and contrast play a large role in how our black and white photos work.

Actually, I hardly know anything. If you want to be a professional gaffer or best boy then you probably would benefit by NOT reading this guide. The rest of you who just want to get rid of that grain and make it look like your film was shot with a camera from 2008 instead of 1988 then feel free to continue.The fundamental and most basic form of lighting that is used commonly professionally is called three point lighting. Essentially you have a strong and focused key light, a weaker and widespread fill light, and a soft backlight. This is commonly used in interview environments and gives a nice even look.Doing an interview for a documentary and what that dramatic and foreboding look? Try something called limbo. Difficult to pull off, it creates a really fantastic look. What you try to do is modify the three point lighting so that your fill light and key light only light your subject - you must minimize all spill to the background (which I seem to have neglected should be a black or dark tarp, cloth, wall, curtain, etc.). You then take the backlight and pull it up high pointing just as you would with a three point setup. I think they did this for interviews in Saving Private Ryan but I haven't seen that film in a while so let me know if I am wrong.Since I seem to be talking about interviews let me give a quick tip - pull your camera back and zoom in (unless you are doing limbo and only if you have an external microphone). This will blur out the background a bit. It also helps to have your subject far from the background. It may feel weird but it should provide a more cinematic look albeit within the confines of the limited depth of field consumer camcorders provide.When on the set, try and use as much practical lighting as possible. Practical lighting is lighting that actually appears on the set and the scene - lamps, overhead lights, flashlights, etc. This will give you a lot of light without it being obvious that you are using extra lights. Honestly, I almost always depend on practical lighting and natural lighting (the sun) when filming... Not a good practice but I can be impatient.Incandescent, fluorescent, and sunlight have different color temperatures. Ever taken a picture at night and the lights appear green? That is because your white balance was set for an incandescent or sunny mode instead of fluorescent lighting. Beware that if you mix types of lights (incandescent + fluorescent) you may have a funky white balance and different parts of your image may have different colors.I get lots of questions about green screens. Let me say first that if you can then don't use one. If you have to though, get the biggest one you can find. Make sure it is not shiny (ie held together with clear packing tape) and make sure it is extremely well light but at angles so as not to bounce the green into your talent. What we want to avoid is getting any green on our talent that would make part of their outline disappear. Light the green screen well, light the talent well - from both in front and behind, and pull them as far forward away from your green screen as you can. Even professional production houses sometimes have problems with their green screens so don't expect stellar results immediately. However, it is possible and fun to try so don't let my warnings intimidate you.The main thing to take away from this is that you should get as much light in your image as possible. Most consumer camcorders have automatic gain control meaning that as the image gets darker, the sensor is made more sensitive to light brightening the picture but introducing nasty grain that is nearly impossible to remove. You all know what I am talking about, the dancing digital dots that instantly give away that your film is actually nothing more than a brilliant (or worse) youtube video. You can always (and easily) make a scene darker in post but brightening always creates hideous results.Whew, what a mouthful. On to cinematography.

If you don't, you might as well skip this section, but don't feel high and mighty like our would-be lighting specialists did. They were excused, you are banished - at least until you go buy one. They're cheap, you can get a basic one from Wal-Mart for $15 give or take.The hallmark of home video is shakiness. Stop! I know every reader simultaneously yelled that their favorite action flick (yes, I hear you Bourne followers) takes the shake and makes it look awesome. Well, good for them. They also have millions of dollars of equipment and talent to make it look awesome. What do you have? Now, I am not completely disparaging hand held video, I do it myself in my film, but it must be used sparingly and effectively.When a viewer first watches your film, they make a snap judgment in the first 30 seconds (probably more like 5 or 10) as to what it is. If you start out like it's an earthquake then they'll say to themselves (as they type you a comment) \"tis is a n00b videoh i cant se waht is hapenning.\" You don't want that. Start out with a nice fluid panning shot, or a stationary tripod shot of a highway, or something that looks big budget and awesome (minus the cranes and dollies and effects and etc).Is it time for that awesome handheld action sequence? Great, put your tripod on the camera. \"Wha?\" you exclaim, \"I said HANDHELD.\" Great for you but if you leave the camera on your tripod and close up the tripod legs, you lower the center of gravity for your camera and though you have become rather clumsy, your shot will be smoother but still retain that handheld feeling. This imitates expensivesolutions rather poorly but it is better than nothing. As a side note if you have $14 left over after you spend your $80 you can make the amazing $14 steadyca which works moderately well.Another pet peeve of mine is poor framing. Now, you may say to yourself \"self, this scene is about my hero, Harry the 10 foot tall poodle raising giant, so I am going to stick his head in the exact middle of the shot because he is the most important thing. WRONG. Watch a movie, you'll notice almost never is someone centered. This is because it looks like garbage. Likewise, there is almost never tons of empty space above someone's head. This is because it also looks like garbage. Let me introduce you to the rule of thirds.\"The Rule of WHAT?! I hate fractions.\" Of course you do, but you will grow to love this one. Basically, divide your frame up into a tic-tac-toe board (many cameras even have a setting to put this grid up on your LCD). You now have three sections left to right and three sections top to bottom - or three sections right to left and three sections bottom to top or some similar combination depending on how unique you have to feel today. Regardless, you want to put your subject in one of these intersections, preferably one of the top two. You also want to make sure that it is a natural placement meaning that if your subject is facing left, you don't put him or her on the left side leaving a bunch of negative space. If you put him or her on the right side then all the space to their left is positive and filled with the intense emotions they exude - or something like that.The best advice I can give is to watch your favorite movie (that is shown at theatres open during the day) and notice how they frame their shots. You will learn a lot quickly. Also plan out your shots - but you already did that with all of your storyboards right?I can tell you how to build super cheap cranes and dollies to get professional movements but that is outside the scope of this general guide.

NOW YOU KNOW. </Bill Nye Reference>Ever hear of a film called El Mariachi? If you are making short films, you should. Even though I don't particularly like it - it is a prime example of low-budget independent filmmaking in a time when it was relatively impossible. The film, made by Robert Rodriguez, cost $7000 to make (though several hundred thousand to prepare for release by the studio). All the audio was redubbed. Am I saying you should dub your audio? Well, if you have poor location audio, yes. But let's avoid it as it is no fun. So how do you get good location audio?If you have only a camera and no external microphone stop reading (unless you're interested in procuring one). I am extremely sorry but there is nothing we can do during production to help your audio woes. You may want to go into a quiet room and redub all of your audio by setting your camera down and talking into it from about three feet away but aside from that, you're out of luck.Still here? If you are looking for a microphone (and I am assuming you don't have XLR mounts - if you do, you don't need my help) then there are a few options. Best in class goes to the RODE VideoMic. It retails for $250 but can be found universally for $150 and often for $120. This is a shotgun mic and can be used with boom poles. If you want a lavalier (what is generally used in news and documentaries - you know, the clippy microphone on their ties) then I recommend Giant Squid Audio Lab (and not just because of their name) who makes professional sounding mics for cheap ($25 - $90 and all you need is a mono mic - probably powered).The key for audio is to get as close as possible and record it as loud as possible. If you have a shotgun that means use a boom pole. If you have a lavalier that means plant it on the talent or do like they did in the first talkies and stick it in a plant or something. You can record to Mini Disc, many mp3 players (I think iriver has an input), your camera (if it has a mic input), and one of many digital audio recording devices. If you are recording to your camera, you will probably need a 3.5mm plug extension cord of about 20-25ft. If you are recording to an external device, make sure to record an obvious sound and action (as in a clap board) so as to sync your sound. Camera mounting is also an option but you may pick up motor noise depending on the quality of your camera's seal.Audio will get more time in Part III as I will discuss sweetening and hiss removal.So, that's a wrap for Part II, at least until a remember all the stuff that I forgot.

Run the wires through the holes in the wreath (use a push pin to start the holes), \u00a0To hold the wreath in place, either bend the wires behind the wreath, or use a bit of glue or tape as needed. Connect the +5 and Gnd wires from the LED ring to the corresponding Arduino pins. \u00a0Connect the LED data in pin to digital pin 6 on the Arduino. \u00a0You can use a different i/o pin - would just need to change the code to use the right pin. Each WS2812 LED+driver can draw about 60 mA when all three colors are on full (white), so if all 16 LEDS are on full, the ring will use 960mA. \u00a0The Arduino Uno regulator is rated for 1 amp, but will likely thermally shut down with that much current being drawn, especially for higher voltages being supplied to the board (since the excess energy is dissipated as heat). \u00a0Also, when supplied by USB, the usable current will be more like 400 mA. \u00a0The good news is that the LEDS will almost never all be on full at the same time, and since they are so intense, you will want to dim them down a lot more than fully on. If you need more power, you can use an external 5 amp power supply and use that to power both the LEDs and the Arduino. \u00a0", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FVS/7TSF/HOUG6072/FVS7TSFHOUG6072.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDH/EII1/HOUG6074/FDHEII1HOUG6074.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9F/TYAW/HOUG6075/F9FTYAWHOUG6075.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGQ/DQE9/HPZT7NFK/FGQDQE9HPZT7NFK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLI/9B4O/HOUG6076/FLI9B4OHOUG6076.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL1/F6D0/HOUG6071/FL1F6D0HOUG6071.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: LEDs and Wiring"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "\n          Adafruit provides a Neopixel library here. \u00a0Follow the instructions there, but basically you will be adding that to the Arduino Library folder, restarting the Arduino IDE, and then you should be able see the Neopixel example code. \u00a0The attached code here is a nice holiday pattern that you can use and extend.
