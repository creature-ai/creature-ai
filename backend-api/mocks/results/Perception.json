Make pencil marks at 2 1/2 inches, 7 1/2 inches, 9 1/2 inches, 12 1/2 inches, 15 1/2 inches, 17 1/2 inches, and 22 1/2 inches.

Make a 7 inch long line along the yardstick, and repeat at the 7 1/2 inch mark, the 15 1/2 inch mark, and the 22 1/2 inch mark. Now at the 12 1/2 inch mark, make a vertical line with your pencil about 11 inches long. Now on each end of the 25 inch long line, make an exactly 3 inch vertical line. We've just finished marking the points on the crown! Now using your pencil and yardstick, follow the second diagram to connect the marks and lines. Now take your box cutter or X-Acto Knife and yardstick, use the yardstick as a straightedge and cut along the yardstick along the outside lines of the crown design. DO NOT CUT INTO THE CROWN! Now push out the crown once you've finished cutting it out! Using a simple pair of scissors, cut out two small strips of cardboard, two inches long and one inch tall. Put some glue on one side of the strips, and place them on one side of the crown. Place them on one side of the crown, on the three inch tall edge.

Now measure from the top of the line at two centimeters and make a mark, do the same thing from the bottom of the line. Now make a horizontal line at the top mark, the line will be 1 1/4  inches wide. The mark will be at 3/4 of an inch, now draw the 1 1/4 inch long line. Repeat for the bottom mark, now at the top of the line connect the top of the line to the right edge of the line below. Repeat for the left side, and repeat for the bottom of the line. Now using they yardstick as a straightedge again, connect the edges of the top and bottom lines with your pencil. Now we've got the general gem shape! Now we'll make the smaller gems!

Now take the yardstick and draw a box, it's going to be 1 inch wide and 1 inch tall, using the yardstick as a straightedge.Now connect the corners of the box, drawing along the yardstick.

Lay the flat crown on the cover, and start lightly covering the crown in paint. Let it dry for a while, and spray a few layers of paint over it.  Make sure you cover the pencil lines with the gold paint. After this side has dried completely, flip it onto the other side, spraying the back side as well.

Take the red and pour a little into a Styrofoam bowl or plate. Make sure you have a good sized paint brush, and a small one. Put a in little bit of black mixing it together to make dark red. Paint a nice coat of dark red on all three of the gems, covering it nicely. Let the paint dry for a while, touching up some missing spots. Then get around the edges of the gems with the paint, letting it dry. Take some masking tape and cut some small strips, following the first two pictures of the diagram. Pour a little bright red onto the plate, and follow the first picture in this step. The masking tape will act as painters tape, preventing unwanted paint from leaking through to the other edges. Paint the exposed left inside edge of the gem bright red, once it's dried. Next mix a little white with the red, making pink. Follow the second diagram picture to align the tape. Align the tape to the top left corner, following the picture. Then lightly coat the inside exposed area with the pink paint. Once it's dried, gently peel off the tape to reveal a nice clean edge. Align the tape on the right side (refer to the first pic of the step), like we did for the left side of the gem. Mix in a little grey with the dark red paint, this will create an illusion of shading. Once the tape is in place, gently coat the exposed inside area with the grey-red paint. Once dry, gently peel off the tape.  Once again, align some tape onto the lower right side of the gem. Mix a little purple in with the dark red paint, again creating an illusion of shading. Once the tape is in place, gently coat the purple-dark red paint on the inside exposed area. Once all this painting is done, there should be an empty dark red area in the middle.Use your small paint brush and gently cover the empty dark red area with bright red. Once that's done the first gem is done! Refer to the fourth diagram picture for tape alignment. With the square gem, the upper left corner should be pink, the upper right should be empty dark red, the lower right should be dark red-purple, and the lower left should be empty dark red. There should be an empty dark red area in the middle, using the small paintbrush, fill in the area with bright red. Once this is done, all the gems are finished!

Well, take that notion of creation and throw it out the window. The only place for creation in the minds of the artistically crippled is in church or your biology classroom.

Once you have that load it up on your computer and start your favorite image editing software. Bonus points if its MSPaint. FYI anything created in MSPaint that appears to look good can have a x10 coolness added to it for being created in MSPaint. Thus increasing your appearance of talent.

Get your outlining color, I used black. Using the brush tool follow all of the edges. It may be a bit tedious but the final product is worth it. I've noticed the more jagged it is the better the picture seems to appear. I believe this is because you mind knows how the picture is supposed to be and if it sees a line where there would normally be a line it shows that and filters out the rest. This is just a guess though.Once you have a basic outline done your going to want to create another layer. This will be your color layer. Just grab your paint brush and paint solid colors. Don't worry about shading yet. Once you have the color layer done it's time for the shading. This is what makes you appear to have talent. Sure people with the artistic capability of a 3 year old can color inside the lines but how many 3 year olds do you know that can shade? This is what sets you apart from the rest of the runny nosed nap taking graphic artists.Now shading isn't as tricky as it looks.  What you want to do is look at your picture. Do you see a shadow? or a dark spot? Using your paint brush set to black with an opacity of 5 or so ish % just start coloring. 5% is just enough to make a slight noticeable difference. If it needs to be a little darker go over it again. I found the best way to fade the shading is to start where you want it darkest. Make your shade. Then go out a little and shade some more making sure to re shade the previously shaded part. Keep doing this till you get the center as dark as you want.Background. If there are elements in the background that you must have do the same procedure you did with the main focal point. Adding background elements however requires a small bit of talent. Proceeded with caution. Otherwise, and to keep it simple, use solid colors that blend or contrast the image. Take a look at my images below for some ideas.As you get better and begin to develop talent you can remove the original photo from the whole ordeal. Instead look at something and later go and draw it. It takes practice to get talent, but why wait just do what I do and appear to have talent from the git go.To get a better feel for the info I have laid down please watch the complimentary video.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FDS/JZH1/FXA304F5/FDSJZH1FXA304F5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOW/T6IB/FXA304F3/FOWT6IBFXA304F3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYP/SD3Y/FXA304F2/FYPSD3YFXA304F2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0O/PAQ7/FXA304EX/F0OPAQ7FXA304EX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOI/XS0Z/FXA304EW/FOIXS0ZFXA304EW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMJ/71HD/FXA304F4/FMJ71HDFXA304F4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8A/RF7V/FXA304EV/F8ARF7VFXA304EV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL0/2GMU/FXA304EU/FL02GMUFXA304EU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3Y/BEWE/FXA304ET/F3YBEWEFXA304ET.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0S/N0KQ/FXA304ES/F0SN0KQFXA304ES.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F54/6P64/FXA304ER/F546P64FXA304ER.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7W/0P6K/FXA304EP/F7W0P6KFXA304EP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDZ/V2BI/FXA304EL/FDZV2BIFXA304EL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQN/1Q5F/FXA304EK/FQN1Q5FFXA304EK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Color by Numbers"}], "channel": "No channel to show"}, {"category": "No category to show", "description": " draw an oval draw a cross shape across the face, one line vertically and one line horizontally draw circles for eyes in the middle of the face", "title": "Draw a Basic Face", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/draw-a-basic-face/", "section": "craft", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "make a pupil in the corner of your eye, add a white circle to show light reflecting off your eyemake a hook from the top of your eye down the front of your face (lightly)add a ball at the end of the line for your noseleave enough space for a mouth and a chin", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FXZ/NX57/IGHVA70V/FXZNX57IGHVA70V.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Eyes & Nose"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "make a curvature at the bottom of your nose, right above the moutherase lines from your faceadd eyebrowsshade with your finger the right half of your face", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F91/RWEV/IGHVA70Z/F91RWEVIGHVA70Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F44/CUDX/IGHVA71I/F44CUDXIGHVA71I.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Shading!"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "to add brightness use an eraserhighlight under the eyebrow, the bridge of your nose and your cheeks", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FUH/FG2H/IGHVA71A/FUHFG2HIGHVA71A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHN/DO8W/IGHVA71T/FHNDO8WIGHVA71T.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Highlighting"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "add hairyour done :)", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 4: Your Almost Done ;)"}], "channel": "No channel to show"}, {"category": "No category to show", "description": "\nI have always wanted to make a real pin hole camera but I have no idea how to process film and I don't have a dark room.

Feel free to branch out and try your own techniques as you get the hang of using them. I was also never taught how to use these, so I'm largely self-taught. I am also not a professional artist but rather a hobbyist and I do this sort of thing for fun. I know my art isn't the best but I'm not getting paid for my skills. Lastly, the image I am using for this tutorial was drawn for someone on another site that was looking for some character design help, and they gave specific examples of what sort of clothing they wanted their character to wear. Anywhoo, let's get on to the tutorial, shall we?This tutorial is going to focus on coloring with markers as well as how to do the line-art to finish it off.

It's mostly to see why I like to color with markers on cardstock as opposed to copy paper.)If you do enjoy drawing, I would advise you to clean your sketch up a bit and erase as many of your guidelines and skeleton shapes as much as possible. Try to make the lines clear without too much scratching around them because you'll be inking on top of your sketch. If you prefer to clean your sketch on the computer and do lineart in an art program, that's fine too.

In case you're wondering, I am using GIMP. It's a free program similar to Photoshop. If you would like me to elaborate further on how to actually use GIMP itself, please let me know! At the moment I'm just assuming you have some basic digital art knowledge because this tutorial will focus more on the marker coloring.Do what you can to clean up your sketch. Play with the eraser tool, contrast, saturation and brightness until your paper is as white as it should be and your sketch is the desired darkness you're looking for. I tend to darken mine up a little bit just  so I can see the printed pencil lines when I'm coloring with darker colors.Print your cleaned lines onto a piece of cardstock. Why cardstock? It's thicker so it won't allow the marker to bleed as much as it will on a piece of copy or sketch paper.Why bother printing what you already drew? Why not just draw your sketch on the cardstock?Through trial and error, I have found that the particular markers I use will smudge pencil lines and have them bleed into what I'm coloring, and the same goes for pen. However, they don't react to printed lines at all so I can color freely without worrying about getting gray smudges mucking it up. As an added bonus, if I don't like the way I colored it I can always print out another copy and try again! Praise modern technology!You should now have something to color on a piece of cardstockThis isn't really a step, but hopefully you have a decent printer that doesn't leave nasty ink marks on your paper like mine does.

It's generally a good principle to start with the skin unless you have a dark-skinned character wearing very light-colored clothing. Ultimately you will want to color the lighter areas first before you do the darker colors because they will blend and bleed together a little bit and the darker colors will get pulled into the lighter color you're working with and end up in places you weren't intending for it to go. Eew.If you are able, have a few shades of the color you want to use and figure out their light-to-dark order. Feel free to use a scratch piece of paper just to figure out what the colors look like. They will rarely look exactly like they do on the cap!Start with the lightest marker and color all the parts that you want in that color. (Optionally, some people skip coloring the lightest parts with the most hard-light shine and leave the white of the paper exposed. I don't do this because it's not how I do things, but I'm just letting you know it's a legitimate method.)Remember that the longer you leave your marker in contact with the paper, the darker it will get! If you look closely at the neck on the last picture, you can see where I let my marker sit on the paper as I took pictures. (oops) At least it's a great example of what can happen, so take it for what it's worth.The larger the area you're filling, the more likely it is that you will leave streak marks showing the strokes from your marker. It's generally a good idea to color in the same direction in wide areas, but normally you can get away with coloring in whatever direction you want for smaller patches of color.Do your best to stay within the lines! Some styles don't require you to keep within your lines and that's entirely up to you, but if you're religiously following this tutorial you will want to stay within the lines due to the fact that you'll be inking over this.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FKK/QYWL/IKFRRV49/FKKQYWLIKFRRV49.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYD/K5MF/IKFRRLHR/FYDK5MFIKFRRLHR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPZ/0PE7/IKFRRLT6/FPZ0PE7IKFRRLT6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTJ/EMK4/IKFRRLT7/FTJEMK4IKFRRLT7.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Pick Colors and Lay Down Some Flats"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "It's time to begin shading and making flat colors look like they have some dimension to them. It's advisable to choose the direction and intensity of the light source in order to give your shadows some degree of credibility. Seeing as this was a frontal shot that is focused more on the character's clothing design, (or lack thereof, seeing as I still don't know what to think of it myself), I went with a simple light source from the front. If you have a good handle on lighting and want to challenge yourself more than this, by all means go ahead!Take the next-darkest color and add your shading. As a general rule of thumb, things will be darkest when they have something overlapping or overhanging them.For example, your chin juts out over your neck. It will cast a shadow on your neck, and therefore that area will appear darker.If you are having problems trying to visualize shadows, take a moment to look around you and observe the shadows. (Is it just me, or am I starting to send some yoga instructor vibes?) ...Ahem... Anyways, if you're still having trouble after this go online and look at stock images focused on showing shadows. The internet is a truly wonderful resource!If you do not happen to have a darker marker in the desired color for shading, you can color over the shaded areas with the same marker that you used for the flat coloring. It won't be as dynamic, but sometimes you just don't have the color you want. (I know it sucks, but you can't always get what you want.)Continue to shade all the colored areas.Once you have finished shading, you may or may not want to take an even darker color and do extra shading in the darkest spots.

I also did a little black shading with the pen at the top of her neck, just under the chin.Feel free to go hog-wild on black shading with the pen. Mine's a bit more on the conservative side, but if you're looking to imitate a different style of art they may do a lot of black shading. (For example, just look at typical comic book art. Don't be afraid to experiment, especially if you are working off a copy of the sketch and are able to make more copies.)Continue to use the pens until you have finished inking.If you have areas of color too dark for the black pen to really show off your lines, you may want to whip out that white gel pen again and draw some lines in white.

On the one hand you will be able to show your mad skills to more people than just your mom, but on the other hand art thieves do exist. You will want to sign and/or put a watermark on your work (as I have done) if this thought upsets you. Many an artist has had their art stolen and, without their consent, been sold by another party. This utterly saddens and sickens me, but by marking your work that makes it easier for you as the artist to take legal action against them. I won't walk you through that mess especially as I haven't had to resort to that seeing as no one really wants my crappy art when there is better art out there, but it's a precautionary method nonetheless.Scan your newly-finished art and open up an art/photo editing program. You will notice that the image on your screen often looks washed-out in comparison with your hard copy. Do everything within your power to make the colors on your screen match the physical copy of your artwork. I would suggest adjusting levels, saturation, contrast and sometimes the hue because that can change when you play with the light and dark values. Screaming and crying may be necessary for this step.Compare your art with the art on your screen, and when you feel like it is finally worthy, double-check! Sometimes you may need to use the eraser tool in order to scrub off paper wrinkles or shadows that would distract from your white background.

The art teacher that had the biggest impact on me in this way was Leon Parson. There was one phrase that he said over and over that really helped me approach drawing in a different way. \"Draw what you see and not what you know, until that happy day that you know what you are seeing\"So often we fall victim to what we think we are seeing based on our understanding of the world. For example, people often draw eyes as this perfect football shape thinking they \"know\" that is the shape of an eye. However, if you take the time to really look at an eye, its shape is really not that symmetrical on either the horizontal or vertical axis. When we slow down and really take the time to SEE we are able to draw what is really there.One strategy that has helped many people to start paying attention to what is actually there is the grid system. What this can do is get someone to focus on a specific section of a picture and work on replicating that specific section. Sometimes, people will even turn it upside down to challenge their brain to look at what is actually there. This is true for both the lines and the shades.In doing this, one would set a grid line on the picture and create an identical one on the paper that will be drawn on. This can also be used to enlarge a picture. Simply increase the proportion size of the drawing grid.All that said, I didn't set up a specific grid on my paper or the picture. However, my mentality follows this idea. I scope out location on the paper and size of different objects in relation to each other.

Once I had the basic shape  of an area I would move on to another spot to build the whole drawing.  Then more drawing, checking and comparing.  During this I am working on getting the right shade/contrast down.  My art teacher in high school, Tom Sarmo, taught me that most people don't use enough contrast in their work.  Their darks are just not dark enough.  I would often bring him something I was working on and he would loudly say, \"More Darker!\"  This is another time to compare the shade of the drawing to the shade of reference photo.I spend time going back and looking at the whole drawing several times check shape, shade and proportion.

If you don't do this you will trap the other pins and won't be able to geth them out later. Fold the top of the bag a couple of times to make it easier to lead through the sewingmachine. Sew about 0,3cm in from the edge around the window. When you sew you won't have to remove the pins as you go although I still recommend being careful.

Anyway that was NOT the inspiration I got for starting this project, but photos of homemade Daleks I have seen on the net, projects people have made on Instructables, especially the ones made by craftycounterpart and by Sci_Fi_Steve which are very cool, and of course Doctor Who's 50th anniversary certainly were. Here I will show you how I made my scratch built Dalek using items I rescued from our recycling bin, a broken but functional radio controlled tank, and other bits and peaces I had laying around crying out to be used. I hope this Instructable will give you some inspiration to make your own Dalek, as I think we need more of these poor misunderstood creatures roaming around our own little planet (even though they are hell bent on controlling the universe). Here is a list of materials I used.

But with a bit of research, trial and error, perseverance, and a little luck, it is worth it. The good thing is, if I did go wrong on something (which I did a couple of times) it was no real bother, as most of the materials I was using were destined for the rubbish/recycle collection anyway, and there was always something else I could end up using. \u00a0The radio controlled tank I had collecting dust, was old and damaged, which was mostly bodywork and a missing wheel, but after replacing the rechargeable batteries and testing it functions, it burst in to life. So now I had a working chassis, forward, reverse, left and right, and a motorized\u00a0 turret which turns about 270 degrees. The motorized cannon which went up and down was also broken, but the motor did still work which I was really pleased about because I had a great use for it. More on that later. The tank chassis measured 35cm by 15cm and 5cm deep from top of chassis to the ground. To make the base, What I did first was to take apart the body from the chassis and remove the cannon motor, battery leads, and aerial wire. I then cut and extended the wires, then pushed them through a small hole I made in the top, slightly off center, of the turret. I then started to make the base.\u00a0 Here's how it was done.1.) Using a sheet of A4 paper as a template, measure and mark out the 11 sides that will help form the Dalek body shape. Using the paper template helped me a lot, as getting the right shape was a bit of trial and error. Measurements I used are as follows starting from what would be the back of the Dalek and finishing with the pointed front. It should be noted that these measurements are what I worked out using photos I found online as finding exact specifications that I could scale down, at the time, proved to be difficult, so I used my best judgment. Back, 12cm Back sides,\u00a0 6cm Main sides, 10cm Off center sides, 5cm Front sides, 8cm Fronts, 6cm To help make it clearer, the measurements can also be seen on the in-photo information. When the sides are marked out and your happy that both left and right sides look equal,, cut out the template.2.) Using a peace of strong corrugated cardboard the same size or larger than an A4 paper sheet, place the paper template on to the cardboard and use a pen to draw around it. Then cut around the marked edges of the cardboard using a craft knife and ruler (or a peace of straight wood) to help keep the edges nice and straight.3.) This part is a bit of trial and error. I needed to cut out a circle of the center of the now shaped cardboard to fit over the turret of the tank, and leave enough room for the turret to move freely with no obstruction, as the gap between the chassis and turret was not completely flat. So cut small to start then cutting more where needed to avoid cutting out to much cardboard and making it weaker. As seen in the photo, I did not cut out a circle but rather cut to shape of the protruding body parts of the tank and helping make the base level.4.) Using some more corrugated cardboard, cut out some 2cm wide strips, cut the strips in to 4cm peaces (about 22 peaces should do), then bend them in half to make \"L\" shape brackets. Now glue 2 brackets to each edge of the base with the hanging part facing towards the outside of the base and as flush as possible.5.) Now using a thinner peace of cardboard like a cereal box (or pizza box like I did), you want to cut out some strips that will cover the sides to hide the wheels and to attach some under chassis lighting if you wish. The measurements I used were 3 an a half centimeters deep leaving 1.5cm ground clearance, and enough cardboard to go all the way around the base plate made previously.6.) Using some glue (I used super glue) apply some drops on to the outside of your \"L\" brackets then attach the cardboard strips. I held the strips in place using some cloths pegs until the glue set.7.) Attach the base to the tank chassis using either glue or some screws and washers (I used glue).8.) Finally in this stage, I had a strip of 10 battery operated blue LED's left over from an old project.(cheap to buy, around \u00a33 / $5). Using some duct tape, simply attach the lights to the inner side of the sides of the base, making sure the battery pack is at the back of the base so you can gain easy access through an inspection panel to be build in to the body later. On to the next stage.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FO6/TJ4L/HR3EFHTU/FO6TJ4LHR3EFHTU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSU/1W4N/HR3EFHU2/FSU1W4NHR3EFHU2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4E/1DLM/HR4SPQK3/F4E1DLMHR4SPQK3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: The Base."}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "What was need to be done now was to create some kind of support frame to take the weight of the body, chest, head and mechanisms. I had to keep the overall weight of the Darlek build down, simply because the tank was kinda old and after some testing, found out that it couldn't take too much weight, as it would not turn properly and the cogs connected to the drive motors would start to slip and make a nasty grinding noise. Not cool. I will give steps on how I made this frame, but there is probably a better, neater way of doing so.1.) Using a thin plastic lid (I used one from a gravy container), make 2 small holes, 1 small pilot hole for a screw, and a second larger hole to feed the wires coming through the top of the turret.2.) Using a stubby size screw, screw the lid on to the center of the turret. I would also advise using some glue to stick the lid down aswell, to help add some reinforcement so the lid does not eventually spin on the turret after a period of wear and tear.3.) With some corrugated cardboard, cut out a long length of about 60cm's which is a bit too long but can be easily cut to size later, then roll into a long tube (enough to put your finger inside), glue together, and wrap in duct tape. Then on one end of the tube, cut down 4 equal lengths about 5cm's and fold out. Glue the 4 tabs on to the plastic lid. I used a small amount of all purpose grab adhesive for this, as you can use your finger to rub it all around to make sure all the tabs are well covered. I will be using this grab adhesive for quite a lot of this project. Its great stuff, easy to work with, drys relatively quick, but not so quick that you cannot work with it. You might also know it as No More Nails or something similar. Truth be told, when I made this tube axle, I only made it about half the length mentioned, as can be seen in the photos. This was because my original plan was to make the chest/weapons section rotate interdependently to the lower body and head like the Daleks in the 21st century episodes, but I had a change of heart. After watching \"Asylum of the Daleks\" I had a thought. As I only had 2 motor's to use, one to rotate the chest and one to rotate the head, \"I want the eye stalk to go up and down\". So that's what I was going to do. Because of this, I now had to extend the length of the tube to reach the base of the head and now have a fixed chest like the older Daleks from the 20th century episodes. 4.) Similar to the previous step, cut out 5 more lengths of corrugated cardboard around 30cm's, then using a ruler of short length of wood, make 5 folds down the length of the cardboard, then glue together to form a square rod. What I did next was to wrap the finished rods in a couple of lengths of duct tape for some added reinforcement.5.) Using a pen, mark 5cm lengths on each side, top and bottom on each rod then, using a craft knife or some scissors, carefully cut down these marks to form 8 flaps, or tabs (4 top, 4 bottom), then put to one side for the moment.6.) Grab yourself another peace of corrugated cardboard. You will now want to make similar to what you did for the base plate, only smaller, with different measurements to almost form a hexagon type shape and cutting a hole in the middle for the center tube axle to fit through. Here are the measurements I ended up using. Back, 5cm Back sides,\u00a0 5cm Main sides, 7cm Off center sides, 4cm Front sides, 4cm Fronts, 4cm As with the base plate, you could use some paper to make a template, copy it over to the cardboard then cut out using a straight edge to guide for a nice clean cut.7.) Now this will require a little trial and error, but can be done before any adhesive is used. Using 2 of the struts, position and then fix to the base on the rear 2 corners. Make sure with all the support struts, the turret has enough clearance to fully rotate without obstruction. When the glue has set, position the top plate you cut out and glue to the top tabs of the support struts.8.) Continue to fix the rest of the struts starting with front middle one. Now the trial and error bit comes in here. You want the top plate to be as level as possible, so here you can alter the size of the strut using and taping up the tabs which will also help to center the top plate and keep the tube axle straight when it rotates. Finish off fitting the last 2 struts and when the glue is dry, simply use a pair of scissors to trim off any excess cardboard from the strut tabs so everything is flush with the top plate.\u00a0 Next, the lower body skirts.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFP/IMRY/HR3EG848/FFPIMRYHR3EG848.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEB/SDGH/HR3EG84G/FEBSDGHHR3EG84G.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Body Frame and Head Mechanism."}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Time to cover up that unsightly cardboard frame and give it some body. The body skirts are made from thin cardboard, such as cereal boxes or something similar.1.) As you are now aware from making the base plates, you will need to cut 11 skirt panels in total. After flattening out your peaces of cardboard, with a pen and ruler, mark out the separate skirt panels. These are the measurements I used. 1 rear panel, top 4cm, bottom 12cm, both sides 19cm 2 rear side panels, top 4cm, bottom 6cm, one side 19cm, other side 20cm (the different size on the two sides of the panel make the angled shape) 2 side panels, top 6cm, bottom 10cm, one side 18cm, other side 19cm 2 off center side panels, top 3cm, bottom 5cm, both sides 18cm 2 front side panels, top 3cm, bottom 8cm, one side 19cm, other side 18cm 2 front panels, top 3cm, bottom 6cm, one side 19cm, other side 18cm Just to reiterate, these are not proper spec sizes, but what I came up with and used, which seemed to work quite well in the end.2.) Starting from the front, and making sure you have the longest side of the front skirt panel facing forward, bend the top of the panel to make a 1cm tab and marry it up to the top and bottom base plates. Make a slight bend on the bottom of the panels so the fit flat to the side of the base covering the wheels. when your happy they fit right, glue in place (with the tabs sitting above the top plate), and use some clothes pegs to hold in place for a few minutes while the glue sets. Do the same for all other panels making sure the adjoining panel sides are the same size to the one your fitting. Leave the rear panel and 1 rear side panel off for now. (If panels are slightly too wide in places, trim to fit). when gluing the tabs to the top plate, you will want to trim off the corners of the tabs so they don't overlap and are all flat. 3.) Now that most of the panels are fitted and glue is set, carefully cover them with duct tape making sure you cover and seal the all the joins of the panels. This also adds to stability and firms up the skirts somewhat. There is enough room to put your hand in to the body because of the missing panels so you can stabilize the cardboard and smooth out any air bubbles when applying the tape. 4.) Thread the motor wires (now for the eye stalk) along with the aerial wire through the hole of the top plate. (an afterthought which might make things neater would be to thread the wires in to the tube axle from the tank turret and out through the top) 5.) Fit the last rear side panel and duct tape it, again sealing the join to the adjoining panel. 6.) With the final rear panel, I wanted to make this into an inspection or maintenance panel so I could easily access the batteries. I simply covered the panel with duct tape, glued the tab to the top plate which will now act as a hinge, then trimmed off the bottom of the panel so the bottom sat just above the base. I will make a fastener using a small peace of Velcro for this later. 7.) As a finishing touch, I decided to use the grab adhesive to help seal the tape to the top plate. Simply pipe a small amount all around the top plate and rub it flat with your finger, covering the tape and cardboard. Now the lower body is done, the next step is the weapons panel and chest section.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FDQ/HH9G/HR4SS54J/FDQHH9GHR4SS54J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDK/TB4A/HR3EIHFW/FDKTB4AHR3EIHFW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Lower Body Skirts"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Moving on up now, the weapons housing and main chest panel now needs to be done. Lets start with the weapons housing.1.) Using a peace of thin cardboard, measure out a 14cm by 15cm square and cut. The 14cm length will be the length of the panel, and the 15cm will be folded in to 5, 3cm sections to create a make a square tube and a tab for gluing together. I want to mention that when I made this part, later on, I kinda wist I had made it a bit bigger, as looking back through Dalek photos again, I realized that I did make it a bit small compared to the real thing, but with my overall project finished, it actually didn't look to bad in the end. Saying that though, I would recommend you increase the measurements to about 4x5cm or 4x6cm square.2.) I had some PVC foam used for carpet underlay sitting around which I am going to use later for the skirt bumper. But what I did for this part was to cut out 6 diamond shapes, 3 peaces glued together,\u00a0 measured to fit snug inside both ends of the square tube to seal off the end, help form the slanted shape, and to help support the weapons (to be fitted later). You could of course use polystyrene or something similar. You will see in the photos that I have a row of 4 red LED bulbs. The reason for this was simply because the circuit board which controls the motor for the eye stalk had these LED's fitted to a small p/c board on a ribbon wire, and I didn't want to waste them as they all worked. Also, the motor p/c board was also going to be housed in the chest section to leave room inside the head. So I used a little artistic license, and fed them through the back of the weapons panel and made 4 holes with a screwdriver for the bulbs to fit through. A peace of PVC foam at the back of the LED board was placed to help secure it in place, then the 2 ends fitted.3.)\u00a0 Squeeze out a small amount of grab adhesive on to the weapons panel and smear it all around and leave to dry. You may need to use a bit more just to seal in any gaps on both ends so they come out nice and smooth when painted.4.) Now make a couple of holes through the front of the panel and the PVC foam (or styrene) where your weapons will be fitted later. When the holes are done, use a bit more grab adhesive and apply to the bottom of the panel, and place on to the top base having the center of the panel slightly set back in to the chest, and enough for both ends to protrude out of the chest (as can be seen in the photos). When the grab adhesive has set, move on to make the chest cover.5.) With some more corrugated cardboard, cut out 2 small disks, one about the same size as the top plate of the skirt (measure it so that the front and back are the same size and the 2 sides of the disk overhang a bit) and the other just a bit smaller (I used a desert / breakfast cereal bowl). Then make a smaller hole in the center for the cardboard tube axle to fit through. Cut out around 10 or 12 strips of corrugated cardboard about 14cm's long and 2cm wide. Make sure to cut along the corrugate as these will be acting as support struts. Then bend 2cm each end on all of the strips to create fixing tabs. You may think that they will not be strong enough, but bear with me and all will be revealed.5A.) The motor for the eye peace had its own circuit board as I mentioned earlier. To house this, I made a small cardboard compartment and glued it to the top base of the skirt section, close to the weapons panel and away from the center axle. 2 wires came from the p/c board that attached to the motor. The motor will sit above the chest section.6.) Glue all the bottom tabs to the top base above the skirts, evenly spaced, and wait for glue to set. Then glue the newly cut disk to the top tabs of the supports, only doing 2 or 3 at a time, using cloths pegs to hold in place until the glue sets. then poke the aerial wire and eye motor through the top hole.7.) Using some more cereal box cardboard, this will make the outer chest cover. No measurements here for this, but what I did was use a couple of sheets of scrap A4 paper, measured out 10 cm then cut out a shallow curve, placed it against the chest area, and trimmed off paper that was to high. Then make a cut out to go around the top and sides of the weapons panel. When I was happy with it, I used the paper cutout as a template and marked out 2 sections on the cereal box then cut them out.8.) Get hold of the grab adhesive and squeeze out a thin piping along the outside of the supports (Only do half of the struts at a time) then carefully place the outer panel on to the struts, gently squeeze together, moving the panel if you need to before it sets. You will have a few minutes to do this before it does set. If (like I had) your 2 outer panels overlap, not to worry. Simply add a bit more adhesive and overlap them. Then finish off by rubbing a little more adhesive over the seams to make a smooth finish. If you did think the support struts wouldn't be strong enough, When the grab adhesive fully sets, the outer panels will now strengthen the support struts making it nice and sturdy. Trust me, I'm a doctor (not The Doctor) ;-)9.) Final peace to do is the outer rim that fits to the bottom of the chest panel and runs under the weapons panel. Cut out a 3cm tall thin cardboard strip ( it can be done in 2 parts like the chest cover), cut out a small section to go around underneath the weapons panel, pipe some more grab adhesive around the bands and attach to the bottom part of the chest, and rub a little bit more over any joins. One extra thing I did was to make a small cardboard battery holder that fits just inside the inspection panel for easy access, without having to tip my Darlek upside down. Leave overnight for all the adhesive to properly harden and have a beer, or a coke. Next we will be making the eye stalk, with an added bonus.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8C/J1WY/HR3EIWX0/F8CJ1WYHR3EIWX0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY9/97NR/HR3EIWXE/FY997NRHR3EIWXE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTY/8O8R/HR4SS9RJ/FTY8O8RHR4SS9RJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL7/J4GP/HR0AW9GV/FL7J4GPHR0AW9GV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWZ/CJF8/HR0AW9GW/FWZCJF8HR0AW9GW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Chest Section and Weapons Panel"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "We're about half way through the build now and are going to make the Darlek look a bit more like a Dalek now. This was a fun part to make, although a little bit fiddly and delicate to do. I had some good photos to go by to make the eye stalk but I did have to make a few slight modifications to the actual eye peace. The reason for this is because I wanted to add something a bit special, a small WiFi web cam, that could be viewed through an iPhone or PC which could stream real time live video and take photos. The materials I used were, A dried out marker pen,\u00a0 A hollow Christmas tree ball-ball, 2 flat top deodorant can lids, Some small peaces of thin cardboard, Super glue, Aluminum tape, A small peace of PVC foam sheet, Some thin lengths of electrical wire, And of course the disused WiFi web cam. Here's how I made it.1.) Using a very sharp craft knife, cut around the hemisphere join of the ball-ball to give you 2 halves. The ball-ball I used had a small hollow nodule to allow a peace of string to pass through to hang it on a Christmas tree. I managed to cut it in half and kept it in tact as this would be useful later.2.)\u00a0 Colour the 2 halves of the ball ball black using a black permanent marker. With the camera, it had 2 small PC boards, 1 with the on/off switch, charging port and battery, and the other connected to the camera lens and microphone. They were connected by 4 small wires with a small, plug which I had to cut and extend. If you decide to use a camera, please bear in mind that it will probably differ to the one I used, and the wiring may be different to what is mentioned below.3.) A. Pull the end of the marker pen off, pull out the felt cartage, then pull out the felt tip using some pliers to now make the marker pen completely hollow.B. Cut and bear the ends of 4 lengths of the thin electrical wire almost twice the length of the disused marker pen.C. Disconnect the plug, cut and bear the ends of one of the 4\u00a0 wires connecting the PC boards (I only had a small amount of wire to work with so I used a craft knife to bear the camera wires (also doing one wire at a time insures that they are rewired in the correct order) then join and twist the ends of a length of electrical wire to the end of the wire on the camera lens board.D. Feed the extended wire through the tip of the pen casing first, then out to the back of the pen and join to the PC board containing the battery. Follow this process for the remaining wires.E. Use some insulating / electrical tape to wrap all the bear wire joins to prevent short circuits.4.) Hold the 2 halves of the ball-ball together and place the deodorant lid at the opposite side of the nodule and mark around the lid. Then with a craft knife, carefully cut around just inside of the mark (as seen in the photo, unassembled)5.) Glue one half of the ball-ball / eye peace to the tip of the pen. This is where the little nodule comes in handy, as it will now act as a support for the pen tip. I was lucky, as the 2 nodule halves put together was a perfect fit around the pen tip. After the glue has set, glue around 1 half of the eye peace and on the nodule and fit together. TIP. What I ended up doing was to glue a thin ring of cardboard around 1 side of the inner rim in one half of the eye peace to help make an easy flush fit when it came to fixing the 2 halves together.6.) Using a craft knife of a drill, make 2 holes in the deodorant lid, 1 in the center, and another towards top center (as seen in the main photo). Pull the lens from the lens cover, feed through the center hole, glue the edges of the lens cover to the lid, wait for glue to set for a couple of hours. IMPORTANT. Waiting a couple of hours insures that glue fumes do not attach themselves to the lens itself, later obstructing the view. Then refit the lens (making sure the lens was the right way up before fixing in place, which I forgot to do at first, oops). What I then did was to glue a very small rubber gromit to the microphone hole, then gently pushed the mic in to place.7.) Apply a small drop of glue to the top edge of the eye peace cut out, working your way around, then attach the deodorant lid and wait to dry. What I did as an afterthought, go get rid of any white patches of dried glue around the join, and the fact I could not have the eye light up like I originally wanted to (due to lack of room for feeding any more wires going through the maker pen casing / eye stalk, and possible glare on the camera lens) was to cut a small ring of cardboard, cut to length, covered it up with aluminum tape, and glued it around the edge of the deodorant lid. Then using some more aluminum tape, I covered the full length of the eye stalk.8.) The last thing that needed to be done, was to make to pivot to allow the eye stalk to go up and down. Using the second deodorant lid, make a hole on the edge of the lid about the same size of the eye stalk so it could be a tight fit, and a second smaller hole about a third of the way around for the camera wires to fit through the other side. Feed the camera wires through the hole and then about 1 or 2cm's of eye stalk for a tight, flush fit. Use a small peace of PVC foam or polystyrene cut to tightly fit inside the lid, breaking a tiny peace off so the camera wires go around the inside of the lid, and not through the center.9.) Lay the lid flat, use a small screwdriver or drill and make a hole through the dead center of the lid, safe to do as the wires are safely tucked away. This is where a small axle will fit through inside the head. The lid I used was red and the foam was dark grey so I used a black permanent maker to colour it all in.10.) Now this was all done, 1 final thing to do was the 5 rings that go on the eye stalk towards the eye itself, simply using a peace of thin cardboard I cut 1 large disk, 2 medium and 2 small disks. With a craft knife I cut out some inner holes about the same circumference as the eye stalk (trial and error), coloured them black, made a small cut through 1 side of the ring, placed the on the eye stalk in this order, small, medium, large, medium, small. Applied a small drop of glue on the eye stalk about 1cm off the end near the eye, then slid the rings in to position, one at a time leaving about 1/2 a centimeter gap between them. Prop up the entire eye stalk keeping it level and allow the glue to set. Finally, use a tiny tiny peace of black insulating / electrical tape to join the cuts made to fit the rings on the stalk. Or put the rings on whole, without cutting, before you attach the pivot section and glue at the end. (Wish I did that, ha ha. I simply forgot). I should note that in some of the photos, where the camera lens joins the eye peace, it can be seen where I did originally use PVC foam but it looked really rough which is when I decided to use the deodorant lid instead which I think looks much neater. Now we are rocking and rolling. Time to do that famous domed shape head.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FCZ/M6VU/HR0AXGK3/FCZM6VUHR0AXGK3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJT/ODI4/HR0AXGGV/FJTODI4HR0AXGGV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2T/3CW5/HR0AXGHJ/F2T3CW5HR0AXGHJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXV/PUB9/HR3EKPOA/FXVPUB9HR3EKPOA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY2/QE17/HR4STTIS/FY2QE17HR4STTIS.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: The Eye Stalk"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Ok, lets give this guy some character. Now before I continue, I have to admit something. I got VERY lucky with the actual dome shape, as throughout the build, I didn't really know how I was going to achieve a smooth dome with a good size. Thoughts were a top of a fizzy drinks bottle (not big enough) a bowl from the kitchen (the chef of the house disagreed), and various other ideas, one of which was a kiddies football that was in the garden and hadn't been kicked in years. I dug it out of the bushes along with another, slightly larger one, washed them, and cut them in half with my craft knife starting with the smaller one. I measured it up against the top of the chest, too small. So I cut the larger one in half, measured it, and I guess my luck was in that day. It was a PERFECT fit, made to measure. That did make me smile. The materials I used for this were, Half of a kids small football (obviously), 2 red 12 volt LED bulbs, Wire, A 9 volt battery snap connector (to be connected later), 2 small screws, 1 long thin bolt about 8cm's long, 2 peaces of \"L\" shaped plastic I cut from an old VHS cassette box, Thin cardboard,\u00a0 2 yellow plasticy tubey thingies the size of my little finger, that came from a Christmas cracker (I really don't know what they are for, but I know what they are going to be), A long screw about 8/10cm's long, and the eye stalk. So, here's how I made it..1.)\u00a0 Using a craft knife, carefully cut a rectangular hole at one side of the half ball, just slightly larger than the eye stalk pivot\u00a0 all the way around so the pivot can move freely. This will form the eye socket. Remember to cut small to start as you can always cut bigger and not the other way around.2.) With a very small screwdriver, make 2 pilot holes half way up beside the newly cut out eye socket, about half a centimeter away from the cut on both sides. Do the same on the 2 plastic \"L\" shape brackets cut\u00a0 from the video tap box, on one side. On the other side you need to make 2 more larger holes which will hold the pivot axle. Using the 2 small screws, screw them in to the pilot holes you made in the head, screws pointing inwards. Now screw the plastic \"L\" brackets through the small pilot holes, attaching them to the inside of the head, with the standing up part of the brackets flush with the eye socket cut out.3.) Use a large drill bit (or a screwdriver then a craft knife, but this will be more difficult\u00a0 to do, but possible) and make two holes on the left and right sides of the head, about 3/4 of the way up, and insert the yellow plasticy tubey thingies which will form the \"Luminosty dischargers\" or\u00a0 ears that flash when a Dalek speaks. The yellow tubes I used were smaller on the top sealed end, and wider on the bottom making a nice tight fit.4.) Grab the 2 red LED bulbs (I had to solder some wires to mine, using red wire for + and black wire for - polarity) then poke them in to the bottom of the ears, and use a small peace of polystyrene to wedge in to the bottom of the ears to keep the bulbs in place. then join both black wires together and red wires together. What I liked to have done here, would have been to fit either a flashing light circuit which i didn't have, or a sound activated flashing light circuit which I did have laying around but I was saving this for my next project.5.) Before fitting, get the eye stalk and place it on your work surface the right way up (so your camera view wont be up side down) then with a screw measuring about 8 to 10cm's long, screw it in to the middle edge of the pivot (6 to 8 turns should do it), about 3/4 of the way up so the screw protrudes about 45 degrees facing up. This will be the counter leaver for the eye stalk. Then using a length of electrical wire, tie around the screw as close to the screw head as you can. Cut a little peace of duct tape and wrap around the screw and wire knot to stop the wire slipping down the screw.6.) Time to attach the eye stalk. With the head up side down, use the thin 8cm bolt, poke it through one of the brackets, so the bolt is just poking through. Place the eye stalk pivot, also up side down, in to the eye socket, then push the bolt through the hole you made earlier through the center of the pivot, then push through the other bracket. This can be fiddly to do, but very satisfying once its done. Just test to see if the eye stalk moves up and down freely with no obstructions, and does it straight and true. At this point you can always reposition one of the brackets if needed.7.) To finish the head off, and to add some much needed stability, grab a peace of cardboard, lay on the work surface and place the head on top. Draw around the head on to the cardboard and cut out a cardboard disk. You will now need to cut out an inner circle to make a ring, about 3cm deep. Use the ever faithful grab adhesive and pipe some out around the edge of one side of the entire ring. Then place the head on to the ring making sure all around is flush with the ring edge. You will have a good few minutes to get it absolutely perfect before the adhesive begins to set, so don't panic and feel you have to rush this step. It will pay off with the end result. So lets give this little fella a neck. That's next.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWW/153G/HR4STY21/FWW153GHR4STY21.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFA/CBAA/HR4STY3O/FFACBAAHR4STY3O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F91/MI8T/HR0AXN8Z/F91MI8THR0AXN8Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUH/OJI1/HR4STY7G/FUHOJI1HR4STY7G.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: The Head"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "This next part was relatively straight forward to do, but I did have a couple of trial and error episodes with some quite comedic results (sorry, I deleted the photos of my first 2 attempts). The only difficulties I had were getting the measurements between the rings correct. My first attempt, after laying the head on just to see what it would look like, ended up having a really tall neck, so much so I would have had to call him \"Dalek Giraffe\". My next attempt was an improvement but still to tall. Third and final go was a success. To make this section I used, Cereal box cardboard, 6x 5.5 cm screws, Some PVC carpet underlay foam 12mm thick (or you could use some polystyrene sheet, And some grab adhesive.\u00a0 Here go's.1.) Using the dessert / breakfast dish used earlier to make the disk fitted above the skirt\u00a0 section, and some cereal box type cardboard, mark and cut out 5 disks. Now with 4 of the disks, use a smaller plate to mark, then cut out an inner circle to make rings about 3cm deep. The 5th disc leave whole.2.) Cover both sides of the 4 rings with a thin coating of grab adhesive, using your finger to rub it in and completely cover the rings. Leave to dry which will only take a few minutes. They might bend a bit when dry, but they will straighten up later when fully assembled.3.) To make the supports, use a peace of PVC foam and cut in to 6 peaces measuring 5.5cm tall and 3cm wide. On the edge of each section, starting from one end, gently screw in one of the 5.5cm screws, trying to keep it as straight as possible to make a spine (see photo). Screw them in the full length of the PVC foam supports.4.) With a pen, measure and mark each strip with the following... 1cm, 1.5cm, 1.5cm. Now with a craft knife, cut down the width of the supports down to the screws (see photo). If any of the grab adhesive peels off, not to worry. this can be re applied at the end.5.) Now slot the rings in to one support at a time, spacing then equally, with the screw spine facing inwards. To finish, apply a little drop of super glue around each edge of the supports and rings when your happy with the positioning.6.) Final steps for this section. Grab the forth cardboard ring,\u00a0 then apply a thick amount of adhesive on to the bottom of each PVC foam support and attach disk to the ring section. The bottom of the ring section is where the supports are shorter, and the top will be taller (as seen in the main photo).7.) The housing of the camera on/off switch and charging port will be situated in the center of the ring section. So for the final part, I added a small metal hinge, measuring about 3cm by 1.5cm which I got from a small plastic jewelry box which easily slid out. I simply opened it up and super glued 1 end to the bottom of the ring panel, hinge join facing out, and positioned so both corners were flush with the edge of the disk so it would be out of sight. This will be at the back of the Dalek.8.) Marry up the 5th cardboard disk you cut and ring section, with the metal hinge facing the rear, making sure you have a perfect fit all the way around and make a small mark where the hinge is to be fixed. Having the super glue to hand, open up the metal hinge fixed to the ring section to 90 or 180 degrees (what ever is easier), apply some glue to the cardboard disk and attach the the hinge plate and wait to set. You will need to wait for the glue to completely dry as you don't want the the hinge to stick together. Now that's done, next we will be attaching the camera switch, eye stalk motor and fixing the ring section to the chest section.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8U/RJ4S/HR3ELNKC/F8URJ4SHR3ELNKC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F46/F216/HR3EM0RB/F46F216HR3EM0RB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOL/YCZJ/HR3EM0RG/FOLYCZJHR3EM0RG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: The Neck Section"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "The two parts I needed to fit together were the lower housing for the camera on/off switch which also contained the rechargeable battery, made of plastic, and the motor housing for what was the tank cannon to make it go up and down, again made from plastic and had 2 screw holes for fitting. Both peaces were about the same size and together would fit nicely inside the ring section.1.) Make a small mark with a pen on the base disk of the ring section directly opposite the hinge placement. This will now mark the very front of this section.2.) I needed to make a wheel for the pulley system to work the eye stalk. The motor had a small white cog fixed to the motor drive shaft. Using a flat top lid from another deodorant can, I cut around the sides of the lid and cut out the flat top part of the lid. I then punctured a small hole through the center and another near the outside of the wheel, and with a craft knife carefully cut out some small teeth in the center hole to fit around the motor cog. Then i squeezed the lid on to the cog and applied a small drop of super glue.IMPORTANT NOTE. I placed the motor on a small length of wood with the newly made pulley wheel laying flat and below the motor cog. This was to prevent any excess glue running down the drive shaft and then seizing the motor.3.) The power switch and charging port for the camera is located on the side of the housing. I needed easy access to these so they were going to be facing the front. The eye stalk motor needed to be facing upward but towards the rear of the ring section (as seen in photo). I simply positioned the 2 parts together until I has happy with the placement, marked, and made 2 pilot holes through the motor screw holes into the camera housing, then screwed together using 2 small stubby screws.4.) After cutting the motor wires, extending them a bit, and feeding them through the small hole in the ring section base, along with the aerial wire, I then made 2 more pilot holes about 1 centimeter apart, in what would now be the the base of the camera housing. Then lining up the front of the camera housing to the front of the ring section, I screwed through the ring section base into the base of the camera housing pilot holes making a sturdy fit, then reattached the wires. For now I just rested the ring section on top of the chest. Time to put it all together.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FNC/I0IR/HR3EO57K/FNCI0IRHR3EO57K.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Eye Stalk Motor and Camera Switch Housing"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "Time to put this little guy together by first fixing the ring section to the chest, and then the head to the ring section. All the wires for the lights and aerial should be connected and running through the center of every panel. You should have a good length of the center axle which will turn the head, poking through the top of the chest section. I should mention here that on a real Dalek, the ring section stays fixed to the chest section and only the actual head dome rotates. I went a little different with this as I didn't want the 4 wires coming from the eye stalk pulling to much on the housing, and I need room for the pulley system for the eye stalk.1.) Cut the center axle so you have about 10cm's poking out the the top of the chest. Using a craft knife, carefully cut 4 evenly spaced slits straight down the length of the axle down to the chest section, and flatten out to create 4 fixing taps that the ring section will be attached to.2.) This step is optional but does help. Using some aluminum tape, stick some to the top of the chest section, the wrap some around each of the 4 fixing tabs. Smear some grease or some petroleum jelly (Vaseline) to the aluminum tape on top of the chest section to provide a smooth movement.3.) Using a peace of PVC foam sheet, cut out a disk the same size as the top of the neck. Then cut out an inner circle to make a ring about 1cm deep. Then glue to the top of the neck panel. This will keep the head level and hide the axle fixing tabs.4.) Making sure the turret of the tank is facing forwards (centered, so it has equal measurement of turning left and right), apply some grab adhesive on the upside to all 4 fixing tabs of the axle, and place the ring section with the pen mark you made earlier facing forwards, on to the fixing tabs making sure no wires are caught in-between both sections. Leave overnight for adhesive to fully set. I actually put a drill battery and some card on top of\u00a0 the ring section to weigh it down while the adhesive hardened. One thing I did as an after thought was to cut some strips of paper and fit them inside the ring supports which would later on become black after painting. Now comes another fiddly bit. It can be done yourself, but having another pair of hands will make life much easier. Before the head is permanently attached to the ring section, we need to fix the pulley wire coming from the eye stalk counter lever, to the wheel on the motor described in step 8.5.) Insure the hole you made in the outer rim of the wheel fixed to the motor, is at the highest point (at the top of its rotation). Rest the head half on top of the ring section, and with the counter lever wire, feed it through the hole made in the outer edge of the motor wheel and tie it off a couple of times. To make this a little easier you can raise the eye stalk so it is pointing straight up to give you a little extra wire to work with. With the wheel at the highest point, the eye stalk should be looking straight ahead or pointing down a bit (as seen in the main photo) and when it is at its lowest point, it will be pulling the wire and raise the eye stalk so it looks up. Then plug in the camera plug to the battery circuit board. At this point, you can check the eye movement by plugging in the main battery and, with one hand holding the head in place, pulse press (quick multiple presses) your controller to check that the eye stalk moves freely and that your happy with the highest and lowest resting points, adjusting the wire length if necessary.6.) To attach the head, apply some blobs of grab adhesive to the top of all 6 of the PVC foam supports and rest the head down on to them, applying a little pressure downward, insuring the head is on straight and even all the way around, then leave to set.7.)The base bumper. Using some more PVC foam, cut out some strips about 4cm's wide and long enough to go around the entire base of the Dalek. I didn't have any foam long enough to go all the way around in 1 peace, so I had to use 2 shorter lengths per layer. Cut enough to make 3 layers to make the complete bumper. 1 layer at a time, pipe some grab adhesive down the center length of one side of the foam, and apply to the sides of the base under the skirt panels, gently squeezing it on, insuring it is straight all the way around. You will have a few minutes to do this before the adhesive begins to set. Do the same to the 2nd and 3rd layers waiting about 1/2 hour between layers. The foam is light enough so it shouldn't slip down. One little thing you can do now if you had to use more than one peace for the final layer, is to use a little more adhesive, put some on your finger, and rub over all the joins to eventually make it look like one peace . When finished, leave overnight.7A.) One thing I forgot to mention, I wanted to insert a small switch in between the last 2 outer layers to switch the under chassis lighting on and off. I did this by cutting a small hole though all 3 layers before fitting to the base. This was done at the rear of the Dalek, just below the maintenance panel. The switch was glued between the 2nd and 3rd layer keeping the switch flush with the outer layer.8.) To finish off, the next day, pipe a heavy load of grab adhesive all around the join of the base and the first applied foam bumper to fill any gaps. Simply rub your finger all the way around to make a nice smooth join (you may need to do this more than once) to fill any small holes that may appear when it sets.9.) To prepare for paint, we are going to cover the entire Dalek with more grab adhesive. Bumper, skirt, weapons panel, chest, chest band, NOT the ring section as this is already done, and the head. Before you do, mask off the ears and weapons panel LED's (if you have any fitted). You should also poke a little bit of PVC foam in to the under chassis light switch. Have a peace of cloth to hand to wipe your fingers every so often. I tried to use a spatula to apply and smooth the adhesive, but it wanted to stick to the spatula more than it did to the body, so my finger was the best bet and worked really well because the heat from my finger made the adhesive really pliable and easy to work with. When dry, rub any rough parts with some very fine sanding paper. The football I used for the head had shallow grooves all around it. After the 1st coat of adhesive dried, it went a brown / creamy colour and the head actually looked a bit like a brain (not very well seen in the photos) and although it did make me giggle a bit, it was not the look I was going for. So I applied a further 2 thick layers of adhesive, smoothing it with my finger, concentrating on the groove areas, then a 3rd thinner coat and rubbed it down. The end result I was very pleased with. A small note, when applying the adhesive around the lower chest and band (seen in photos) use a small screwdriver or something to clean out any adhesive between the 2, because you don't want these to be a flush fit and want the band to stand out a little (which will be more noticeable after painting. Okay, starting to look like a Dalek now I hope you'll agree. Next we will give him (or her. Are there any female Daleks?) some firepower.

The materials I managed to source for these were as follows, 3 used up marker pens (1 wasn't quite used up but it made the sacrifice) A rounded lid from a shaving cream can Some thin steel wire Aluminum tape Glue and a small screwdriver 1 screw and small peace of PVC foam (or polystyrene) 1 LED bulb + wire (I used green but wanted to use a blue bulb, but didn't have any) and a working black marker pen.1.) Hollow out the 3 marker pens, removing the ends then the felt cartridge's and nib's.To make the manipulator arm2.) Colour the rounded lid with the black permanent marker inside and out (unless you have a black lid)3.) Make a small pilot hole in the top center of the lid and insert a screw. Then twist a small peace of foam on to the screw.4.) If you can, insert 2 of the marker pens in to each other, if not, then glue together. Then carefully wrap some aluminum tape around the length of both pens making it as smooth as you can, twisting the pens and smoothing the tape slowly.5.) Squeeze the foam and lid in to one side of the pens for a solid fit. Glue together if you wish. And it's doneTo make the gunstick7.) Wrap the leftover pen with aluminum tape. Then on the main body of the pen, using a very small screwdriver, make 6 equally spaced pilot holes near the tip end, and then 6 more about 3cm's from the end.8.) Poke the wires of the LED bulb through the tip of the pen and out the back end. Glue the LED to the end of the pen tip.9.) Cut off 6 equal lengths of the steel wire, and bend both ends to the same length of the the pilot holes, end to end of the pen. The bends need to be about 2cm long.10.) One at a time, poke the bent ends of the wire in to the pilot holes, enough that the length of the wire sits above the pen shaft about 1cm, then add a small drop of super glue to each hole to secure the wire in place. (In the Photos, You will see a grey pen lid. I didn't use it in the end as the LED didn't illuminate it enough). Put the weapons to one side for now, as they will be attached after painting.

Only one more step before we do though (although a little paint will be used here). A couple of peaces to complete to make our Dalek look a little more, well, like a Dalek. The chest slats and the all important Hemispheres. A Dalek wouldn't be a Dalek without them. The materials I used for these parts are, Cereal box cardboard polystyrene balls measuring 3cm diameter (I had to purchase these online) Small pot of touch up emulsion paint Grab adhesive 22 small modeling tacks (tiny nails). These are normally used as model railway track pins, fixing the track to a baseboard. And some thin steel wire. Lets start with the chest slats.1.) Using the cereal box cardboard, cut out 8 small slats measuring 6.5cm x 3cm, and 14 slats 8cm x 3cm. I should mention here that it wasn't until later after I painted them, I realized that 3cm's was a little bit too wide as photos of other Daleks have about 16 long, thinner slats and about 6 short ones, so feel free to play around with the numbers. With the measurements I used, I ended up using 4 short slats and 7 large ones, which at the end didn't look too bad.2.) On half of the cut out slats, you need to mark and cut out an inner section (as seen in one of the photos). Now apply a little grab adhesive around the edges of the cut out slats and stick on to the whole peaces. To help with the smoothness and shine, use the laminated side of the cardboard facing outwards. 3.) Now push 2 small tacks in to each slat, one at the middle top, and one in to the middle bottom. Then using a scrap peace of card, polystyrene or something similar, push the tacks in to it, keeping a small gap between the slats and keeping the slats raised slightly above the polystyrene surface so they don't stick, and you don't end up pulling any paint off the slats when it has dried. This will help all the slats stay in one place and not blow around when you spray paint. Now for the hemispheres.3.) I purchased a bag of 50, 3cm diameter polystyrene balls which cost me about \u00a33 / $5. For the hemispheres I needed 26 balls to be cut in to 52 halves. To start with, using some thin steel wire I used earlier, I cut 30, 5 to 10cm long lengths and bent one end of each in to a hook. I then pressed the other end in to the center join of the balls about half way through. I did 30 balls for some spares.4.) Then using the small pot of paint (doesn't really matter what colour) dip each ball in to the paint and flick off any excess drips. Then while still holding the wire, slowly tip each ball up and down to make sure each ball is evenly coated and reducing the size of any drip bubbles. Hang the balls up and when you have done all of them, go back and check for any major droplets hanging off the bottom of the balls and just repeat the process of moving the ball around again. As seen in one of the photos, I used a couple of thin strips of wood suspended on the paint cans I will use later. Leave overnight to dry.5.) When dry, gather all the balls and remove all the wire hooks. Now with a sharp craft knife, cut down the center of each ball as straight as possible, making equal size halves, starting where the little hole is where the wire hook was poking in.A WORD OF WARNING just in case your not aware. Polystyrene and spray paint are not friends (As seen in the last photo). At this stage I mounted all the halves on to a couple of small pizza boxes with tacks pushed through the top of the boxes at equal spaces, and mounted the half balls on to the tacks still leaving a small gap so they wouldn't stick to the boxes. I then primed and spray painted all the half balls with a couple of coats. When they completely dried, some disaster. Some of the spray paint got underneath the small gap I left between the half balls and box, and started eating away at the bear\u00a0 flat side of the polystyrene leaving some really rough edges on some of the halves. This was lack of forethought on my part as I already knew the paint would react with the styrene, which was the whole point of dipping them in the emulation paint in the first place.6.) So after that hiccup, I Used some more spare balls, dipped in paint, dried, and cut in half. This time I covered the bare styrene base with some grab adhesive to seal it up and this time it worked. Another obvious way would have been to cut the balls in half then dip and spray. My problem with this was that a small hole made by the wire hook might cause an issue later and become viable after spraying. Or of cause I could have poked the wire in from the flat side, which I tried, but the halves kept coming off the wire and stayed in the pot. Spray painting a whole ball might have cracked or chipped paint away when cutting. Final way would have been to get a small pot of gold emulation, but I couldn't get hold of any. Anyway, all the parts are ready for painting.

After a couple of days of looking at many many pictures, and indecisive thinking of what colour scheme I wanted to use, I really liked the idea of black and gold, so, that's what I went with.1.) Mask off the ear lamps, eye stalk (with a plastic bag and tape), as much the eye stalk pivot as possible (I used electrical tape poking it in as far as I could), and weapons panel LED's (if fitted). Now you can apply the first coat of grey spray primer. Place a small sheet of scrap wood or corrugated cardboard on to the surface where your going to paint, then place the Dalek on top. This will make it easy to turn the Dalek without touching it while painting. Now apply the first coat of primer with thin even coats over the entire body. Leave to dry (as per can instructions) then apply a second coat, keeping about a quarter can primer left over. Just to note, I used 1, 500ml can of primer, 1 gloss black, and 1 gold.2.) Next, apply the rest of the primer to the chest slats and half spheres. You should get 2 coats out of whats left of the primer.3.) Using a strip of black plastic mesh used for gardening, place the paper template you used to mark out the cardboard chest cover, and cut the mesh to roughly the same size with a pair of scissors. Marry it up to the chest and trim the mesh where needed. Apply some grab adhesive to the chest cover, doing it a section at a time, then attach the mesh. Wait a few minutes for the adhesive to go off and continue all the way around. Any overlap of the mesh, simply cut off and if it is not a perfect match it wont matter as it wont bee seen when the slats are attached.4.) Use a refuse bag and cover the head. Open up the ring section where the camera switch is located, and tuck the edges of the bag underneath. Just double check to make sure the bag is not overhanging any part of the body. Tape up any parts of the bag that are. Now Spray the entire lower body with the black spray, again using thin even coats. You should get about 3 to 4 coats. Leave for at least 24 hours or until totally dry with no tackiness anywhere.5.) When the black paint is totally dried and cured, carefully remove the refuse sack looking out for any paint that may be joining the bag to the top of the neck. Now do the same process of masking with the same or another refuse bag, this time covering the all of the black section of the lower body. Now you can hit it with the gold paint. As there is less surface area for the head, you should get 2 to 3 coats of gold paint leaving you just under half a can of paint. Use this half can to spray the chest slats and spheres, making sure you get every angle of the spheres. Again, you should get about 2 coats of gold. Leave again for 24 hours to properly dry.6.) 24 hours later, you can now carefully remove ALL the masking. Just make sure the bottom of the ring section is clear of any over spray, and not stuck to the top of the neck by inserting a small screwdriver and slide it all the war around. You can also plug the battery in and use the controller to turn the head in each direction to check everything is hunky dory. Side note. Both the gold and black spray paints I used advised against using paint lacquer, the black saying it will dull the shine, and the gold saying the gold wont be as gold and will be more of a silver colour. So I didn't use any, and the end result was great. That's the painting all done. Fun while it lasted.

If you stuck with me so far, your a real trooper, and if you skipped to the end to look at the good pictures, that's cheating (and they're on the next steps haha ;-). Only joking. Right, let's get this bad boy done and dusted.1.)Chest slats. Remove the chest slats from the scrap polystyrene holder. Now at this point, I was going to remove the tacks from the slats but a liked the look of them as they looked like little gold rivets. Using some wire cutters, I tried to cut the end of the tack, and it cut really easily. If you do this, cup one hand over the upside down slat and cut. This will stop the excess tack flying off somewhere only to be found later when you step on it. Ouch.2.) With all the tacks now cut, leave the slats upside down on the work surface and apply a little drop of super glue to each tack and leave a few minutes to set. Next, starting with the smaller slats, apply with a line of grab adhesive down the back center of the slats, one at a time. Then attach to the chest panel over the black mesh with a very gentle push, just slightly off center of the front of the Dalek, over the weapons panel. Then do the same for the next small slat. Then add the next two small slats, making sure they are all level and evenly spaced. The texture of the grab adhesive will hold the slats in place without you having to hold each one in place until it sets.3.) Now continue with the rest of the larger slats. Its best to attach the first longer slat beside the weapons panel first, then fix your second slat to the rear directly over the inspection panel. This helps you evenly space out the slats all the way around. Done. 4.) Hemispheres. Starting from the top of the skirts,\u00a0 you will need one sphere per panel, with the exception of the larger side panel which will have two. Simply apply a small blob of grab adhesive to the flat side of the spheres in the middle. Then gently press them to the middle of each small skirt panel, and two side by side on the two larger panels. Work your way around doing every panel. Insure that all the spheres are level with each other, gently sliding any in to place that need to be repositioned.5.) Now repeat the process, this time around the base just above the bumper. When the base is complete, go panel by panel adding the final two spheres (four on the two larger side panels), making sure they are evenly spaced down and across the skirt panels. Done.6.) Weapons panel details. The pizza boxes I used to fix the half spheres to, had a healthy coat of shiny gold paint. Shame to waste it, so with a craft knife, I cut out a small section and then very carefully cut the corrugate off to leave a thin sheet of card. I then cut out two 3 x 3cm squares and a 5 x 2cm rectangle. With the craft knife, I cut out two circles in the square cut outs the same circumference as the weapons, and a smaller rectangle in the 5 x 2cm peace, enough for the 4 LED's to fit inside. Then I simply super glued them in place. Done.7.)Weapons. starting with the simpler weapon, the manipulator arm (sucker), squeeze some grab adhesive (yup, still got some left) in to the left hand hole of the weapons panel and push the arm in, pointing it in the direction you want. This will set hard and you will not be able to move the weapons once the adhesive has fully set. If you would like poseable weapons, you could use plasticine, Blu-tack of something similar. unfortunately I didn't have any to hand.8.) Gunstick (laser). With a drill or screwdriver, make a hole going through the already made gunstick housing hole in to the chest panel. With a thick peace of scrap wire, poke it through the hole and feed in to the base and out of the inspection panel. With the end pointing out of the gunstick housing, attach the two wires from the LED in the gunstick and pull the end hanging out of the inspection panel, feeding the LED wires through the body and out of the inspection panel.9.) Now remove the scrap wire from the LED leads and wire them to the 9v battery snap connector you put aside earlier in the build. Now pipe the grab adhesive in to the gunstick housing and push the gunstick in to place, while gently pulling the leads from the inspection panel. Done.10.) Final finishing touches. Using a little bit more of the PVC foam, cut out some small strips, size enough to fit between the rings and ring supports. Colour them black with a black marker. Then apply a little drop of super glue to the uncoloured side and place between each of the rings between the support panels. Use a couple of small screwdrivers to push in place and attach to the paper inside the ring section. Last thing as an optional extra, I wrapped the controller with some cardboard, coloured it black, and added some of the damaged gold half hemispheres using some grab adhesive. Done and done HURRAY. \"I christen thee, Dalek BOB (Built Out of Boredom)\". And now the build is pretty much finished. All that needs to be done now is to recharge the main and camera batteries.

Dalek BOB pretty much looks the part, but he is a little quiet, so here's how I made him talk (sort of). \u00a0I used a Bluetooth sun visor car kit and my iPhone. The speaker was small enough to fit inside the inspection panel and didn't cause any obstructions to the tank turret which turns the head. I made a second battery compartment made from cardboard, attached it on the top of the turret, and placed the main battery in to it. I now used the original compartment I made to rest the speaker in to it (as seen in the second photo). I then downloaded a soundboard creator app from the app store, found some Dalek voice samples online, and recorded them to the soundboard app. Paired the phone to the speaker, opened the app, and started pressing buttons to make BOB talk with the words and phrases I recorded.

Overall, building BOB really was a fun and interesting build to do. The only real difficulty I had with this build was getting the body skirts right. They are not exactly correct, as the back should have had a slightly steeper drop (less skirty looking). Another little niggle I have is that the eye peace is a little bigger than it should be, but it was the only way to safely house the circuitry for the camera, but in the end I don't think it looks too overly big (at least not comically so). Overall I am pretty happy with the end result and would love to do it again. And guess what? I'm going to. I still have got quite a few materials waiting to be used, and our recycle bin fills up fairly quickly, so, I have decided to start a new build, this time building my favourite Doctor Who character of all time, K-9, and with a fun Idea to make him speak even better than Dalek BOB, using an iPhone/Android/PC app I found. And if you were wondering how I got Dalek BOB to shoot a laser (as seen in a couple of photos), It not CGI, photo editing or anything like that. Quite simply, I used a translucent green drinking straw fitted to the end of the green LED. A bit of fun but I hope you'll agree, quite effective. My only wish was that the bulb was a bit brighter. Oh well. If you made it this far, I would like to take the time to thank you for reading, and I really hope you found my instructable entertaining and useful. I have tried to keep it as simple as I could, but also detailed enough for novice and seasoned builders alike. If you haven't already, check out the short video I made showing of BOB's various movements and features.\u00a0 I\u00a0 also mode another short video showing both my K-9 and Dalek BOB builds interacting with each other. The video is no cinematic masterpiece, but just a bit of fun showing off how K-9's A.I programming responds to the pre-recorded phrases from Dalek BOB, sometimes with some interesting results. So have a quick look, it might make you giggle. We (Dalek BOB and I) would love to hear your comments, thoughts, ideas, and suggestions, along with any questions or quires you may have. And If you do decide to take up the challenge of building your own Dalek, we would love to see what you come up with. That's all from me for now. Thanks again for reading and, \"Happy Building\".

We didn\u2019t have the blueprint plans for any rebels to steal while making our CAT-CAT, so we needed several good reference pictures. After finding a bunch online we had to decide how big we wanted our CAT-CAT to be and how much fear we would strike in our enemies' hearts. We knew we wanted something around 3\u2019 6\u201d tall and as proportional to a \u201creal\u201d AT-AT as possible. Using our reference picture we decided that every inch on the pictured AT-AT would be 7\u201d in real life. For example, our reference roughly 4\" long legs, so that means our legs were cut at 28\u201d long. This turned out to be a surprisingly simple ratio, and we rarely deviated from it. This proportion also gave us just under our 3\u2019 6\u201d height. Since we wanted our CAT-CAT as realistic as possible, we knew we could not start at the bottom and build up. The way the hips articulate and attach, it would be easier to start with the mid body and build out from there. After the body, we made the head and then tackled the legs, being careful to keep all loose cables away so we wouldn\u2019t trip the CAT-CAT up (until the last step, of course). We attached the legs to the body and base and then added the feet. From there we started detailing and overlaying the ankles and legs, moving up and armoring the body. Finally, we detailed the head with overlays. All of this was designed and custom fit on the fly; we tracked our measurements and angles at first but quickly realized the futility of our actions - there are so many parts, angles, and bevels, and wood is never perfect. So treat all our measurements (if given) with a grain of salt and consult your reference pictures often. That said, one of our most common angles used was 15 degrees. If you have an angled piece you need to cut, it is recommended you start at that 15 degree angle and add and subtract degrees from there. So without further ado, let\u2019s do this!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FE5/QATP/JIOU3SWG/FE5QATPJIOU3SWG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Planning"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "First, we cut out the floor of our CAT-CAT main body. Find a reference pic that shows a top-down view. When you look from this view, you\u2019ll notice that the AT-AT tapers to the front and back. We cut out our floor in a rectangle first using the circular saw to make a rough cut \u00bd\u201d wider than the piece we needed. We then used the table saw to trim an \u00bc\u201d off each side to get down to our final width. Last, we used an arm saw to cut the length we needed. (We used this same combination of circular saw, table saw, then arm saw for the majority of our cuts; it helped us get the straightest, most accurate cuts.) We then marked out our tapers. They were short enough to cut out on our arm saw. If your arm saw doesn\u2019t have a deep reach, make the cut using a circular saw or lightsaber.            After the floor was cut we then built the frame for the hips and legs to attach. Using our reference we made this hip frame short enough to be hidden by the teardrop shaped hips, and proportionally wide - about 22-1/4\u201d long by 5\u201d wide. You won\u2019t be able to see very much - if any - of it when all the CAT-CAT details are added.            On the top and bottom of the floor find and mark the center line of both the length and width. Use the reference points often to make sure you keep everything symmetrical. Next, we centered the hip frame on the body floor and drew lines to mark where it would go. Then, apply a thin line of wood glue to the top of the hip frame. Place your body floor on the hip frame and press down and wiggle into place. (Literally wiggle the piece as it helps activate/set up the wood glue.) After its centered and in the place you want it, use the staple gun and add a few staples to hold everything together. The staples act like a clamp and hold everything together while it dries. Fill in the staple divots with some wood putty because next we\u2019ll start adding walls.            To make the center section walls we first cut out the plywood. Use your reference to find your height and width, and then rip a 1x2 and a 1x1 out of one 2x4. Remember 2x4\u2019s are actually only 1-3/4\u201d x 3-1/2\u201d because the Rebel Scum at the big box stores like to lie to you! Frame out one side using the 1x2\u2019s for the uprights (see pics for the orientation). This will be the wall opposite of the drawbridge door entrance. Before you frame the door side, make sure you measure, mark and cut your door out. We used a combination of an arm saw and scroll saw to remove the door. We eventually used that same cutout as the door later, so don't throw it away. Attach what\u2019s left of your door panel to the frame. Use a slightly wider board on the top to form a lip the door can close against when in its upright and locked position. Now attach your two walls to the floor. They need to go in the center section, right where all the tapers begin. Glue and staple the frames in, again using pressure and a wiggle to set the glue up. We used two staples in these pieces. If you hang the floor over the edge of your work table you can staple without having to flip it all over.            Are you feeling confident? Feeling like this is going well? Good, because now here\u2019s where the fun begins. The face and butt sections of the body not only taper down from the top and the sides, they also taper in less than a 90 degree angle. We played around with this a bit, and using 15 degree angle cuts and angles close to that, we were able to make walls and frames like the center section. Cut your plywood for the walls, and add in the angled frames to make it all as flush as you can. This is not for the faint of heart. We guessed, cut, and re-cut, taking just slivers of angles off until we were happy with how all the angles worked. For the front and back walls we intentionally inset them. We did this for two reasons: one it looks look that in \u201creal life\u201d, and two we didn't have to cut more angles to make everything flush. We also added a 2x4 behind the front wall where the neck will connect. Make sure you pre-drill and countersink two holes for the neck to attach to, as you might not be able to get a drill into the body later.Don\u2019t worry if you\u2019re not quite flush around the edges; that\u2019s what the wood putty is for. Also, make sure you\u2019re gluing everything before you staple it together for the most secure hold. After we were done with the walls we noticed we didn\u2019t quite have the center section as raised as it was supposed to be. This was easily remedied by adding a 1x1 frame and then adding the roof. The \"shoulder\" and butt sections' roofs were glued and stapled to the wall frames after the edges were angled to match the wall angles.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FK8/VVXL/JIOU3FMA/FK8VVXLJIOU3FMA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0F/47J2/JIOU3JIL/F0F47J2JIOU3JIL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUF/EJJ2/JIOU3IMA/FUFEJJ2JIOU3IMA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWI/Z9ZZ/JIOU3I32/FWIZ9ZZJIOU3I32.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZN/T0K7/JIOU3J5E/FZNT0K7JIOU3J5E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNC/M2JR/JIOU3H9E/FNCM2JRJIOU3H9E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIK/ZKIV/JIOU3HQC/FIKZKIVJIOU3HQC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCQ/DIZQ/JIOU3GIR/FCQDIZQJIOU3GIR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ3/BZKX/JIOU3MXL/FZ3BZKXJIOU3MXL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX6/5X4Q/JIOU3NT4/FX65X4QJIOU3NT4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKR/WPJ0/JIOU3OGB/FKRWPJ0JIOU3OGB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVS/JTDK/JIOU3NE3/FVSJTDKJIOU3NE3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Main Body Chassis Frame"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "For the head frame, we followed mostly the same process as we did on the body.

While we wanted the CAT-CAT posed mid step as if to crush some rebel scum, we decided our cat's safety was more important and that all legs should be on the ground. We found a reference that had all straight legs and thought this would be the easiest and most structural configuration. Cut four 2x4\u2019s 29\u201d long. Then find a point centered and 14\u201d down from one end that we will call the top.  Use the scratch awl to make small hole. Put your compass in the hole and extend the pencil end to the edge of the 2x4. Then use this radius to draw out a circle. Keep this radius and mark it out on a scrap board or piece of paper as we use this radius for other details. Use that same radius to draw out a circle as close as possible to the top of the leg. You\u2019ve just marked the hip joint and the knee joint for one leg. After marking the knees on all, take the legs to the scroll saw and cut out notches to give the illusion of articulating knees. Next we get to make the hips. These are the teardrop shaped pieces that help the body stay level as the CAT-CAT marches forward to battle. For these we used the same radius we used for the knees on one side, and the other side was a small, metal coffee can. Use your reference and find out how big you want your hips and you can use the compass to draw the other circle. Then connect the lines so you have a teardrop shape. The small radius will eventually mount to the body, while the large radius will mount to the legs.             So let\u2019s do just that. First mount the hips to the legs. We countersunk and pre-drilled a 2\u201d wood screw. DON\u2019T glue this one in yet. We will glue after we level the body. Next, countersink and pre-drill the hole to attach the hips to the frame. Now were getting somewhere! (Get it? Because the legs are attached? No, okay.) Next we need to position the legs and prep them to level the body.            First let\u2019s cut out our base/pedestal. We originally wanted a 29\u201d x 48\u201d pedestal so the whole CAT-CAT had base under it, however, it was too big and we later cut it down to what you see in the final pics. We liked the  organic shape better anyway.            After you cut the base, place the CAT-CAT on top of it. Position the legs in the stance you want, and raise and lower the hips to level it out. Make sure you level in both the length and width dimensions. Then mark the orientation where the legs meet the hip joints; you will use this line later. Use a 1x1 (or ruler) to mark a straight line at the bottom of the legs. Remove the legs one at a time and cut  to make them mount flush and level. Then, glue and screw the hips and legs together using the marked line from earlier and attach to the body. Next, position your CAT-CAT on your base and glue and screw it in with the 3\u201d screws.

You can hear the clang and thunder as it walks. A Rebel pulls out his macrobinoculars and sees the AT-AT's giant foot. The camera slowly pans up and the hearts' of the traitorous rebels sink down below their boots. We want to inspire that same amount of dread with all the details we put into our CAT-CAT. The details you add from here on out really help bring your CAT-CAT to life, and the results are definitely worth the effort. We started with the pads of the feet. First we ripped a section of 2x6 and 2x8 in half. Then, we placed the two halves together and measured out the radius of the bottom pad on the 2x8 using our reference picture. Cut out your four circles on the band saw, arm saw, or scroll saw. After cutting, use a belt sander or hand sander to smooth the edges as close to a perfect circle as possible. Do the same with the 2x6 and a smaller circle to give the foot the two-stack shape it has. Next, center the larger radius circles on the joint where the legs connect to the base. Mark and cut out notches with a jig saw or other saw so the foot fully surrounds the leg. Use a similar process on the smaller radius, making sure you center the small circle on the larger one. This is not how the Imperial Walker's foot connects to the leg, but we were willing to sacrifice looks for practicality and stability of the CAT-CAT. After everything is cut, secure the bottom circle with glue and screws, and the top with four brads or staples. Make sure you don't drive brads or staples into your screws.Next, we added the toes. For this we cut a piece of scrap wood on the table saw in such a way as to reduce the amount of end grain in the diagonal side. The longer the grain on the diagonal, the less likely your toes will break in the long run. We only glued the toes down.After the toes were glued on, we moved up to the ankles rockers. These have the same radius as the larger foot pad, but they extend straight down after a semi circle is complete. We cut our pieces out of 2x4's and made them longer than needed. Then we found a scrap 1x1 to use as a reference and held the rockers up to the leg and marked the angle. After cutting and fitting all 8 rockers, we countersunk a small hole and attached a small plug to look like a giant swivel pin.

We really felt like the layers added a whole new dimension to the project and the more we added the more our CAT-CAT took shape. I wont go into details on every bit of armor overlay as the process is almost identical with every piece. First measure and cut the armor piece you want out of the surply (primered 1/4\" plywood) . Next, sand down the edges to provide a clean edge. Then glue onto the CAT-CAT, with the primer side out. For small pieces you're done. For larger pieces consider using a brad or staple. Just be aware of what you're stapling into. Don't staple into straight plywood unless you have very small staples. Long staples and brads can leave sharp points inside the body, and I can guarantee your cat will not like that. So when you're done, ensure no Rogue Ones made it through to pester your Imperial Feline. You can really go all out on this step and I wholeheartedly suggest you do.

During this whole process we have been filling in gaps with wood putty and sanding it down, but this was our final chance to fix any oopsies, fill in holes, or make sure the armor was connected and smoothed accurately. ie. Some crevices are filled but others are left to look like armor overlay.Sand the CAT-CAT down one final time; we finished with an 80 grit sandpaper. We used the air compressor to blow off the dust and get in tight corners and then wiped down the CAT-CAT with tack cloth.Now it\u2019s time for painting, and let me warn you, you have about 7 hours ahead of you. As you might be able to tell, we painted the CAT-CAT in our living room. This is for three reasons: Missouri gets way too muggy and hot, and we didn\u2019t want the paint to dry funny. We personally wanted to be comfortable while painting \u2013 out of the heat and to be able to listen to TV. And sometimes you have to paint on your back, which we didn\u2019t want to paint for hours on the shop floor. Just make sure you lay a lot of cardboard and newspaper on the floor to keep it clean. Start by painting the under belly of the cat tower; this way, you can work from the inside to the outside and don\u2019t have to stick your hands in the drying paint. I used the 1\u201d brush for most of the CAT-CAT, the 3\u201d brush for the top and side panels, and the teeny brush for the small details (especially around the butt area). The first coat took about 4.5-5 hours. I would say, \u201cmake sure you let your paint dry before you start your second coat.\u201d But unless you\u2019re a Jedi speed painter, you\u2019ll probably be fine.

But we wanted more dimension. We considered using a Dremel to inlay the doors and panels, but we didn\u2019t want the tool to slip on the uneven wood grain and create an unfixable groove. Therefore, we used a black (we wished we had a dark gray) paint pen to add the details that we wouldn\u2019t be able to with wood. First, we started with the big side panels and taped up an AT-AT picture where we could easily access it. We then measured out the long lines, exhausts, escape hatches, and doors and figured out their distance from each other using the 1:7 scale. The lines were drawn in pencil as there is a lot of erasing in the beginning! Then you will use your paint marker to cover the pencil lines. Test out the paint marker and ruler on a practice piece first because the paint can sometimes run under the ruler (or tape line)! We had to use a ruler with a cork strip underneath to lift the ruler off the wood, that way the paint line was straight and didn\u2019t bleed underneath. In this step, you can add as little or as much detail as you\u2019d like.  And yes, we watched Star Wars in the background for mental inspiration. If you need help on your detailing, I'm sure your cat will sit there in the way and watch you work. At this time you can also add the red adhesive to the \"eye\" section and add the silver duct before screwing the head on. The red film is super easy to apply; just measure your eye space, leaving 1/4\" or so around the edges (framing the red), and cut with scissors. Peel off the adhesive and press in place. For the silver duct, we measured the neck distance and cut the duct with a metal-cutting Dremel wheel.

First, we wanted to add a padded bed. If you have a cat, you realize how finicky they are with where they sleep. Honestly, ours would rather sleep in a cardboard box than a fluffy bed, so the pads didn\u2019t need to be thick. The top pad is easy; take the rectangle measurements (mine were 9.5\u201d x 12.5\u201d), add a half inch on both sides, and cut out two gray fabrics and one batting. Stack the layers - gray, gray, batting- and sew all the way around the rectangle, leaving a 3\u201d hole. Clip the corners and turn inside out. Lastly, stitch with an 1/8\u201d top stitch.             The inner pad is more complicated. I recommend taking measurements and creating a \"T\" pattern out of paper. Test the paper template before you cut and sew the pad, and follow the steps above to complete. You can use adhesive hook and latch strips (Velcro) to attach the pads to the CAT-CAT.            The Stormtroopers and Snowspeeder toys are created using iron-on paper. I printed out the desired pictures and then ironed them onto white fabric. I then cut out the Stormtroopers and snowspeeder, leaving a \u00bc\u201d gap, laid them onto their reversed sides, and zig zag stitched around the piece, leaving a gap for stuffing. I stuffed with poly-fil and then finished sewing the raw edges. To attach the stormtroopers on the inside of the body, I hot glued on cord and hung them from the ceiling. For the snowspeeder, I wanted it to look like it was wrapping tow cable around the ankles trying to take down the CAT-CAT, like Wedge Antilles did in the Battle of Hoth. To achieve this look I hot glued cord to the rear of the speeder and wrapped it from the back right foot around the front, and hand sewed on thread which attached to the door base.

I realized that I could use these 'slices' of my wife's skull to create a 3D model. After a little experimentation, including a sloppy foamcore model and a flipbook, I decided to paint each layer onto an acetate sheet and stack them in a box with LED backlighting. Here we see that original lamp with blue lights and the new one in green that I will describe in this instructable.  The basic idea is to paint each 'slice' of the MRI onto a pane of glass and stack them up in a frame. LEDs mounted in the top illuminate the layers creating a glowing 3D effect. My approach to design is to look around my workbench and scrap pile for usable stuff and make it work. Everything used in this project was either recycled or laying around my shop. My goal here isn't to teach you how to build a lamp but to show you how I built a lamp. Feel free to do with it what you will.", "title": "Making a 3D Lamp From an MRI and Recycled Materials", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Making-a-3D-Lamp-From-an-MRI-and-Recycled-Material/", "section": "workshop", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "  If you don't have an MRI of your skull laying around ask friends and family. Chances are someone you know has a set. I found a low resolution scan online by doing a GIS. Perhaps a medical student or friendly medical professional could help you out.  An MRI basically presents a series of images of 'slices' of the body part that was scanned. Bone shows up particularly well in white. What we want to do in this step is to create and print an image for each slice of the skull which we can place under each pane and trace with paint. Each pane will be stacked in order to create the illusion of three dimensions.  In this case the MRI came on old fashioned film. More and more doctors are saving and sharing this information in digital forms. Either way we want to import these images to a computer, open them in the photo editor of your choice and make them usable for our purposes. I used a piece of white paper for a backing and scanned my MRI films with a standard desktop scanner.   I used Photoshop, but you could easily use Gimp, Corel, Paint, or any other image editing software. Specifics vary from program to program and user to user, but here's what you want to do-1. Crop each frame of the MRI into a separate image. Each image should be the same size, carefully aligned and numbered sequentially. I create a duplicate layer, use the rectangle tool to highlight a frame, crop the image and save it. Next, use the move tool to slide the copied layer to the next frame so that it lines up to the canvas edges and save it with the next sequential number. Repeat this for each frame of the MRI. 2. Adjust the brightness and contrast of each image to accentuate the bone structure and darken the rest of the image. It may seem like more work to process each image separately, but making adjustments and applying filters to the whole image first makes it harder to align each frame properly since a lot of detail is lost after the adjustment. Use batch processing to automate the tedious task of adjusting each image.3. Convert each image to greyscale, invert the colors and simplify it. The idea is to make each layer clear and easy to trace later. In Photoshop I convert the image to greyscale under Image>Mode and then invert it under Image>Adjustments. Automate this if possible. Now you should have a set of black images representing the cross sections of the bone. Go ahead and clean up the image, eliminating any black marks that are not bone. Take your time. Sometimes dental fillings or surgical screws cause a 'flare' effect. These spiky artifacts are kind of cool looking but they can also be carefully erased layer by layer if you choose. The more time spent cleaning up and refining your image, the better your final product will be.  When all the images are cleaned up, I use the cutout filter to smooth and simplify the image. Set the layers to '2' in the filter's options and you will get a black image of each bone cross-section on a white background. Play around with the settings to get a good balance between simplicity and detail.4. Give each image a thin black border and a number. This will make aligning each frame to a pane of glass later much easier. Open a new blank layer. Use the wand tool to select the entire canvas area. Use Edit>Stroke to add a thin black border to the image. Copy the border layer into each image and use the text tool to add the layer number to each image.5. Resize each image and print. Determine the dimensions of glass you want to create and resize each image appropriately. Set your printer to print in black and white only and use a low quality/draft setting to conserve ink. Check the prints and if everything is acceptable, set them aside for later.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FRA/S5IM/HW00IMHP/FRAS5IMHW00IMHP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLC/CZCA/HW00IMHL/FLCCZCAHW00IMHL.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Finding and Processing Your Image Set"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "NOTE- Glass is sharp! Wear eye protection and gloves. Be careful cleaning your work area as tiny slivers of glass may be present. Use common sense and research any materials or tools you are unfamiliar with.Determine how many layers you want to use. For this lamp I used 16 layers. Your mileage may vary.  I used left over glass from a friend's frame shop. Frame shops often have thin strips of glass left over and they will usually give you some. Frame shops are also a great source of matt board scraps which are very useful. I got enough scraps of glass to cut twenty 5.5'x6.75' panes.  Glass is hard to work with. It smudges easily, it has sharp edges and it's fragile. Find a clean, clutter-free area and assemble the following--glass panes-90% alcohol-clean, lint-free rags-the printed 'slices' from Step 1-a small cup of white paint. I recommend Zinsser BIN primer. It sticks to glass pretty well and it's affordable. -small paintbrushes   OK let's get started. This is an assembly line process, so set up your work space so everything is available and orderly. Place your first slice printout in front of you. Take a glass pane and clean it well with the alcohol and a rag. Wear a glove to protect yourself from cuts. When the alcohol dries, place the glass on the image. Use the border of the image to align the edges of the glass.  When the glass is positioned properly, use a fine brush and trace the dark areas of the printout with white paint. Use a small flat brush to fill in all the dark areas with white paint. Be careful not to touch the glass with bare fingers or to move the glass. Take your time. Don't worry if the paint doesn't cover evenly- this is only the first coat!    As you finish a pane, leave it on the paper printout and move it carefully to the drying area. Paint each pane in turn and lay it out to dry. Be careful to keep them in order.  By the time you get to the last pane, the first one should be dry. Start over again, painting another coat on the white areas of each pane. It may take three or four coats, depending on the quality of the paint you use.  You want an even color  and opacity. The final image will be seen from the unpainted side, so check it from that side to judge its evenness.

You'll want to add some kind of spacer between each layer. Here's what I used--black craft foam sheet-hobby knife-ruler-black masking tape  Use the ruler and the hobby knife to cut 1/4 inch strip out of the craft foam. Cut these strips to the height of you glass pane, in this case 5 1/2\".  Take the first panel and give it a final wipe down with a lint free cloth. This should be the 'front' panel when you are looking at the final lamp. Place it in front of you with the painted side facing down. Cut a strip of the black masking tape to the length of one side of your pane, in this case 5 1/2\". Place the tape along one edge of the pane, covering about 1/8\" or so on the non-painted side. Do this for the other side as well.  Flip the pane over so the painted side faces up. You should have a strip of black tape sticking out from the left and right edges of the pane with the sticky side facing up.   Place a craft foam spacer strip along the side, even with the edge. Hold it in place while you carefully bend the tape up so that it grips the foam strip.  Find the next pane. Wipe it and place it on top of the other pane and foam spacers with the painted side facing up. Make sure that the panels are stacked straight and aligned properly. Add another layer of spacers and another panel. Depending on the width of the tape you are using, after 3-4 layers you should have just enough tape left to fold over and cover about 1/8\" of the edge. Fold the tape over and burnish it with a smooth plastic implement like a pen cap. Don't use your finger to smooth the tape! Sharp glass can cut right through thin tape and slice your finger.  Set this bundle of panes aside and bind the next 3 or 4 panes the same way. When they are all done, combine these individual bundles with spacers between them and black tape. Be careful to keep everything in order and make sure the painted sides are all facing the same way (towards the back of the image).    Wow, now you should have something pretty cool looking! Be careful handling this bundle of glass panes. You don't want to break it now. Let's build a case to protect it and add some lights!

The dimensions may vary depending on the size of your panes but there are a few things to keep in mind.This isn't a 'how to...' so much as a 'how I...' so feel free to adapt any kind of case you like.    I measured my 'glass sandwich'. I turned out to be 6 3/4\" x 5 1/2\" x 3\". I used a scrap piece of 11/16\" plywood that was 5\" wide and several feet long. I cut one piece that was slightly longer than the width of the glass sandwich, here about 6 7/8. I cut two sides that were the the height of the glass panes plus the width of the plywood plus 1\", or about 8 1/2\". I also cut a top out of a scrap of Masonite that was 5\" x 7 3/8\".    To assemble the case frame I attached the sides to  the ends of the base with nails and glue. I attached the Masonite top panel with nails and glue also.    Next I cut strips of 1\"x1/8\" pine to create a frame that attaches to the front of the frame and hangs over the inside lip of the front opening to hold the glass panels in place and hide the edges and spacers.     When everything was dry I gave it a quick sanding and started finishing the case.    Since this was intended to sit on a shelf with books, the sides wouldn't be too visible. I decided to use a faux stressed metal look for the front of the lamp. I used the aluminum duct tape used for air conditioning repair. I crumpled the tape and then smoothed it out before peeling the backing and applying it to the frame. Once the tape was applied and flattened down with a smooth implement, I applied a thin coat of grey spray paint and then wiped it off with a naptha soaked rag. I repeated this with another shade of grey and a coat of white. I then added a thick layer of green paint and wiped it with a naptha soaked rag, filling the cracks and leaving a slight green glaze. After this was completely dry I painted the whole thing with a thin coat of acrylic black, working it into the cracks, then buffed it with a soft cloth leaving an aged look. Finally, I wrapped the sides and top with extra wide duct tape.

I did this because I had the parts on my workbench and I prefer to save money and recycle.  I used six 3.3v green LEDs. Usually, LEDs require a resistor to drop the incoming voltage to a usable range. Since our battery is 9v and our LEDs use 3.3v, we can run three LEDs in a row (in series) on 9v without a resistor. By splitting the positive from the battery into two separate leads, running each through a string of 3 LEDs and reconnecting them on the other side connected to the ground, we can light all six LEDs very easily.

Next I taped the circuit board with the LEDs to a piece of matt board that was cut to fit into the top of the frame. I used a bit of the aluminum tape on the matt board to reflect the light down on the glass panes. Use a strip of tape to hold the card in place.  Next I soldered the positive lead from the battery to the switch, the switch to the positive lead from the LEDs and the ground from the LEDs to the battery ground lead. I drilled a hole for the switch in the top of the case and cut out a slot for the battery holder. When everything was in place I cut out a piece of masonite to make a cover for the back and the lamp was done.  I wanted the option to use batteries or plug it into the wall. I used an old 9v wall wart power supply and added a standard 9v battery connector. Please note that when using a (v battery holder in this way it must be soldered in 'backward'- the positive lead should go to the black wire on the connector and the ground should go to the red lead.

This project is open to modification and substitutions. It could be built from all new materials or from recycled and scrounged materials. My first skull lamp was done with sheets of acetate. While this worked, the acetate film sagged a bit. The glass made for a much neater image. You could also use acrylic sheets. Maybe the clear sections of old CD cases would work in a pinch. Another technique I've thought about would be to use an adhesive rubber mask on the glass and cut out the design and use a sand blaster to 'frost' each layer into the glass.  There are also plenty of lighting options. My first attempt used a string of LED Christmas lights. A small LED touch light with an external switch would work also. It would be cool to add some addressable LED strips to add movement and color changes.  The main thing is to be creative and have fun. I use recycled and repurposed materials because it's fun to make something from nothing. This project used recycled glass, scrap wood, left over paint, bits of electronics from my workbench and other odds and ends from my shop.   This project makes a great gift for that special someone.

I used to wear classes, then contact lenses, then nothing. I hadn't worn any corrective lenses for years because glasses were annoying and my contact lenses were messing up my eyes. One day I was thinking about the reason for near-sightedness and I figured that if it's caused by an inability of the eye's lenses to flatten out, then maybe I could physically assist them in some way instead of just optically correcting for the problem like 'corrective lenses' do. Then after trying some things I realized that I could pull back back on the skin at the sides of my eyes and this seemed to do the trick. Since then I've been in several seminars in which I successfully used this trick to be able to read the screen or chalkboard that was too far away for me to otherwise make out clearly. So I decided to make a simple device to do this for me. What I made probably wouldn't be something that most people would want to wear in public, but a professionally made, miniaturized version of such a device might have more widespread appeal, and it was fun to make and test in any case.\nNote: Squinting is thought to work by decreasing the amount of light entering the eye as well as by slightly flattening the eye's cornea. The cornea is a lens of the eye that is responsible for a majority of the eye's focusing power. If one squints one can notice a decrease in the field of vision indicating a decrease in eye's aperture. However, when pulling at the eyelid corners with your fingers you will notice an enhancement of distance vision greater than that achievable by squinting, and without any noticeable decrease in field of vision. So it seems that this system works more by flattening the cornea than it does by decreasing the eye's aperture. A final possibility for how this system works is related to the eye's length: In near sighted people light from distant objects converges slightly in front of the retina (the part of your eye that actually detects the incoming light and sends the information to your brain). Using this system the pulling back on the eyelids may be compressing the eye slightly, thereby allowing the convergence of light rays to occur further back in the eye: at the retina, allowing clearer vision of the distant objects.\n\t\u00a0", "title": "Squintasaurus: Cybernetic Dynamically Adjustable Vision Enhancement System", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Squintasaurus-cybernetic-dynamically-adjustable-v/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "\n\t\u00a0\n\t\u00a0\nyou'll need a pretty strong linear actuator to be able to pull your skin enough to have the desired effect. I remembered that CD players had nice worm gear motors in them to move the laser back and forth across the CD, so I looked through my junk pile and found an old CD walkman. I tore it apart using screwdrivers etc. and took out the linear actuator assembly, this will look different depending on the CD player but it's easy to identify if you know what you're looking for. I didn't take photos of this part so you'll have to look at the photos I got from wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD_Walkman, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc_player).\n= The first photo shows a portable CD player, you could also take apart a non-portable CD player but those are usually a little harder to take apart.\n= The second photo show the inside of a CD player. The black region on the green board on the left is what you're after, it has all the necessary motors and gears attached.\n= The third photo shows this same mechanism from the underside, showing the motors and gears. You do not need to disassemble this mechanism, you will use it as is. All you need to cut are the wires leading to the rectangular motor (as noted on the photo).\nLooking at the third photo: We'll be interfacing with the rectangular motor which is connected to the worm gear which is connected to the laser lense. The laser lense gets moved linearly, up and down along the worm gear. A 'worm gear' is the best way to allow low torque motors (such as the small rectangular one in the photo) to be used in high torque applications (like this one), but some cheaper CD players won't use worm gears. These alternate gear configurations will also work ok for this application.\n\t\u00a0", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FLB/UTI6/GYQFN28S/FLBUTI6GYQFN28S.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFW/X1FB/GYQESLX3/FFWX1FBGYQESLX3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVD/3DA9/GYUY0V0M/FVD3DA9GYUY0V0M.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Get the Linear Actuator"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "\n\t\u00a0\n\t\u00a0\nTo control the motor I made the circuit shown below. The M is the CD walkman's motor. Cut the wires going to it so you can connect it to your circuit. The circles in the middle of the circuit diagram are transistors. You could also use opto-isolated photodiode arrays or other types of switches. Everywhere you see a '+' means connect that wire to the + side of your power supply (in my case 3 AA batteries). Wherever you see a sideways christmas tree that means connect that wire to the - side of your power supply.\nThis simple circuit uses a tripole switch (a switch with three settings) to control the linear actuator we got from the CD player. This switch is composed of my thumb, index finger, and ring finger, each of which has wires attached to them. By touching one's thumb to 1) the index finger 2) ring finger or 3) nothing, one can respectively turn the linear actuators motor counterclockwise, clockwise, or not at all.\nThis happens because in the first switch setting (thumbs wire touched to index finger wire) I'm connecting power (+5V) to the bases of two transistors (follow the blue line). These transistors, when actuated allow power to flow through the motor from left (the + power side) to right (the - power side).\nMeanwhile, in the second switch setting (thumbs wire touched to ring wire), I'm connecting power (+5V) to the bases of two other transistors (follow the green line). These transistors, when actuated allow power to flow through the motor from right (the + power side) to left (the - power side).\nFinally in the third switch setting I'm not touching my thumb to either the index or ring finger wire, so the motor doesn't get any power at all and therefore doesn't move. Because of the way that worm gears work, de-powering the motor will leave the laser lense at its current position, even if there is a force applied to it (i.e. if it's still pulling at the skin surrounding the eye). Again, this makes worm gear ideal for this application.\nIn the second photo you can see this circuit in its assembled state. I put notes in the photo so you can see what's what.\n\t\u00a0", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F4D/3N8Y/GYUY0MEH/F4D3N8YGYUY0MEH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0V/2ZYA/GYVDHPUT/F0V2ZYAGYVDHPUT.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Build the Circuit"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Here's some photos of the control circuitry attached to my hand.

I tied a thing string to the laser lense and taped the other end of the string to the skin at the corner of my eye.

Their objective was to see if it was possible to smuggle \"pancake mix\" across the U.S. border at night when no one is looking. First, each of them waited in a dark room for about 20 minutes, then one by one, they went through the pitch-black course in Go-Karts. They found out that you can finish, but only with hard work. But they realized that they were missing something. They went through again, but this time they had a \"cop\" on a Go-Kart chasing them. They had to chose to turn left or right depending on which way the correct sign was pointing. Getting through the course without being caught was noticeable more difficult due to the pressure from the cop. Then they did the test one last time. This time they had a robotic RC car built to flash a very bright light at them while they were driving to simulate a car passing by. This bright light ruined their \"night vision\", and they immediately could not see where they were going. In that episode they explained how the night vision worked. Your eyes contain a chemical protein called rhodopsin, and what that does is help your eyes see in the dark. But when you go outside or see light, the rhodopsin is bleached out. So in order to get it back, you must wait in a completely dark room for 20-30 minutes. This waiting period also widens your pupils so that more light is allowed into your eyeball. Light = small pupil; Dark = wide pupil. That is why your pupils get really small when you come out of a dark room. When I saw how this worked I remembered something that I had seen some time ago, and that was red light. Red light could help you maintain your night vision when being exposed to light. This is because the rhodopsin is less sensitive to the color red, which has a longer wave-length than other colors. At first I thought, red windshields for when headlights pass by you, then I realized that those weren't very practical. The thought stayed in my mind for the longest time.

Just like replacing a spare tire on your car, it's better to finish driving the screws in an alternating pattern. If you just screw them in from left to right in a straight line, any misalignment will get worse by the end. By alternating, any misalignment is spread evenly across the whole piece, and not concentrated at one end. When it was screwed in, I held it up and it looked good.

But there's a range where things are still reasonably in focus. The size of the acceptably-focused region is called the depth of field. Now, I don't study optics and the factors that affect the depth of field are beyond my motivation to look up, but it's okay because we aren't going to use a lens.\nThere is another way to create an image, though. Instead of gathering the light with a lens, you block all the light that isn't going the right direction with a pinhole. The simplest cameras were just a light-proof box with a pinhole in it to project an image onto the film at the back of the box. They're really cool and I'd make one if I had photographic film. Alas, I don't.\nIdeal pinholes have infinite depth of field. Since they don't depend on the focusing properties of a lens, all distances are in focus. They do decrease the field of view and make the image rather dim, but we care about the depth of field part.\nReal pinholes have a non-zero diameter, so there are some limits to their depth of field, but in general, the smaller the aperture, the larger the depth of field.\nIn order to see the board from the back of our lecture hall, we're going to put a pinhole in front of both of our eyes.

I picked the dreary and ugly corner pictured below. Some considerations to take into account when picking your wall:Does it have a clear line of sight to where you want the illusion \"focused\"?(Even the coolest image in the world isn't going to \"pop\" unless you have a good place to view it from. Pick a place that's far enough away [4m+] from where you'll be viewing it.)Does it have enough room for the image?(the most appealing illusions are going to be rather LARGE... the bigger the better. Does the wall have enough room to accommodate the scale of the image?)Will mounting the image be a problem?(Is the wall rough or stippled, or will it present any impediments to the specific mounting-method you are going to employ? How high up is it? Do you have a ladder?)SELECT YOUR IMAGE: I worked with a single-color image. This makes printing costs quite a bit more reasonable and the contrast makes it \"pop\" more. I bet some cool effects could be accomplished by using images other than linework... but it's going to make it more complicated. Try to limit yourself to fewer (ideally \"one\") color to save some headache... (or, hell, go all-out... I'd be excited to see what you can come up with if you pull it off). Some considerations to take into account when picking your image:Can you get it in vector format?(Not a requirement for the project, but it makes things quite a bit easier.)If you're not working with Vector, is the image's resolution sufficient to blow it up to the size you want? (Not going to go too far into this in this instructable, but there's probably an internet forum out there who could help you if you're unsure about what constitutes \"big enough\".) It's to your tastes and your quality-standards, ultimately. I wouldn't make something of anything close to this size without a 2000px raster image, minimum. Your mileage may vary. Additionally: There are many ways to vectorize raster graphics... Poke around for an instructable if you're interested. Some methods produce great results, some not-so-great; and some are easier than others.Will this image look cool in forced perspective?(Personally, I like how geometric images come together in forced perspective, but I've seen some awesome organic shapes, as well. Typography would look nice; high-contrast looks nice... Give some thought to finding the perfect image; there's tons of 'em out there).I ended up going with the following logo.

It's important to give some thought to where you want the \"viewing spot\" to be.At the very least, pick a place where people's eyes can physically BE... not many people are going to be standing on top of your refrigerator, so why make the focus there?  Try to pick a place where people's eyes are likely to linger.  Maybe at \"seated-in-a-chair height\"  in the spot where guests are likely to be seated?

It is important to note that the purpose of making these tape rectangles is to provide contrast for the photo you will shortly be taking. That being said, it is important to select a tape color that provides good visual contrast with your wall.SELECT SIZE OF RECTANGLES: The size of the rectangles you select is, ultimately, an arbitrary decision -- but it will be influenced by:Size of your printer/output device(I was going to output to 24\" wide vinyl... so I made my rectangles just a shade under 24\")Size and proportions of your image/logo(My image was a circle. So my 3 rectangles are roughly the same size. If your logo has an eccentric shape, or is markedly off-center, you might want to make one/some of the rectangles larger or smaller.)For my project, I selected rectangles of 22\" x 22\", 22\" x 24\", and 18\" x 18\". Yours will probably be different. I chose slightly differing dimensions so that they would be visually distinct from one another (so that the edges would be staggered). This helped out quite a bit, and I would recommend doing this.MEASURE AND MARK THE RECTANGLES ON THE WALL: Use a pencil and measure out the rectangles by marking the correct distance from each wall. If you have a combination square or a spirit level, these might help to double-check your measurements. I'm not saying that you have to have it exactly right down to the millimeter, but the more accurate you are at this stage the more accurate the transformation will be. So, why not spend a little extra time on this step and get it as close as you can?TAPE THE PERIMETER OF EACH RECTANGLE: You're looking to make a \"box\" of masking tape for each of the three rectangles. Look at the picture of the finished boxes to help you out if you're having a hard time visualizing it.Remember: Keep those taped lines level/plumb and keep your angles square! I've worked for years as a signmaker, so my visual sense of \"level\" is pretty (preternaturally) accurate... if you're having doubts about your ability to do it visually, it might be time to whip out the spirit level/combo square again at this point.Lastly: take your X-Acto knife and trim away the excess tape leaving something close to perfectly square corners.PROVIDE A CONTRASTING COLOR WHERE THE BLUE RECTANGLES TOUCH ONE-ANOTHER: I mentioned that we're gonna be photographing this, right? So, unless you want to drive yourself crazy staring at pixels in your image-editor and trying to decide where one blue shape stops and the next one begins, we should provide a visual \"break\" between the two boxes.I used colored electricians tape. In the final analysis, I wouldn't recommend this. The tape was fussy and difficult to work with. If you have an alternate color of masking tape, use that to define the edges. Or use a thin bead of paint, or a marker, or stickers, or whatever you'd like, but in summary:Wherever one blue rectangle touches another blue rectangle on a different wall, provide a high-contrast visual break between the two.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FUG/CANE/FPWWRDLE/FUGCANEFPWWRDLE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6G/QBVO/FPWWTQ39/F6GQBVOFPWWTQ39.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQQ/TB4P/FPWWQMBQ/FQQTB4PFPWWQMBQ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Measure and Tape Your Walls"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "This is something like what you should be seeing at this point.

The only things that matter are that you have rectangles of known size that have crisp edges that contrast from the wall, and are visually distinct from each other.Clarifying note about the picture:The \"crosshair\" pattern I put in the center of each one is not at all necessary.

We're already dealing with some distortion from the wide-angle lens... but that's not all that destructive, all-told.  Now, if you cock-up this step and go for \"roundabouts\" where the viewers eyes are; that will hurt and possibly ruin the final effect.  Pardon my shouting, but it's just that essential: IF YOU ARE IN THE \"VIEWING POSITION\" AND YOU ARE HOLDING THE CAMERA IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE, THEN THE LENS IS NOT WHERE THE VIEWERS' EYES WILL BE.Keep the taped rectangles in the center of the frame, and keep it as close to vertical as possible -- Using a point-and-shoot camera with a wide-angle lens means distortion creeps into consideration.  There's less distortion in the middle of the lens.  We're going to be rotating the picture in our image editing program, but try to keep it vertical, just so you have less to rotate.Take a sharp picture -- I'm no kind of \"good photographer\", but this particular project doesn't really require one.  We want a SHARP, contrast-y picture with no blurring.  How do we do this?  I'm sure a more skilled photographer could give better recommendations (feel free to make suggestions), but I just lit the hell out of it, kept a very steady hand, and shot on ISO 400.

I'll let you know how it goes, and post an Instructable if I find a method that works well.I'd love to help you with your forced-perspective wall-art... so feel free to ask any questions you may have, or to ask for clarification on any sections I may have left unclear.  Many thanks, and good luck on this and all your other projects. - jjijj", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FVX/NQHG/FQ2DZEF7/FVXNQHGFQ2DZEF7.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 18: Summary, and the Road Ahead..."}], "channel": "No channel to show"}, {"category": "No category to show", "description": "This is my first Instructable so bear with me. I am sorry that some of the pictures are a little blurry.\r\nEvery little kid loves to catch lightning bugs in the summer, or butterflies, or even ladybugs. So why not make this cute bug house for your little ones to keep their cute creatures in while they are hunting. It may not turn out perfect. I know mine didn't. But if your kids are anything like mine they will have it destroyed or lost in less than a week. But at least they will enjoy it for a little while.\r\nMaterials:\r\nDuct Tape (I used gray, red, purple, and blue)\r\nPaper (I used regular copy paper but recycled paper is fine because the paper does not show.)\r\nScreen scraps or Plastic Canvas (I used plastic canvas)\r\nRubber band\r\nWire hanger or other stiff wire\r\nScissors\r\nPliers\r\nPen for marking paper tubes\r\nPacking or Scotch tape (optional)\r\nNote: To make paper tubes:\r\nLay paper diagonally.

Make 4 paper tubes.\r\n2. Take 1 tube and bend it about 3/5 of the way down the length. Cut the ends so they are flat. The exact location of the bend is not important for the first tube, but this will determine the size of the box bottom.\r\n3. Take a piece of duct tape, that is a little longer than the long end of the tube, and lay it sticky side up on a flat surface.\r\n4. Lay the tube so it is in the middle of the tape and the flat end of the longer side is flush with the end of the tape.\r\n5. Wrap the end of the tape around the bent end of the tube. You want to cut and tuck the tape so that\u00a0it tucks nicely against the tube. Pull the top of the tape down and wrap it around the tube and against the bottom part of the tape but not to the bottom edge of the tape.\r\n6. Take another piece of tape that is a little longer than the short side and do the same as the last step. Lay this piece aside.\r\n7. Repeat steps 3-6 to make another piece of the box bottom. Make sure that the tube is the same length on both ends as the first piece.\r\n8. Lay the pieces so they make a rectangle. The tape will overlap in the inner corners.\r\n9.\u00a0Take strips of tape that are a little smaller than the rectangle and lay them sticky side up and overlap them longwise. You want enough strips so when you place the rectangle on top, they fill the open space in the center of the rectangle.\r\n10. Lay the rectangle, sticky side up,\u00a0on top of the strips so the center is covered.\r\n11. Take the next tube and cut one end flat.\r\n12. Lay the tube diagonally across the rectangle with the flat end inside the corner, where the wrapped tube is bent. Mark where the other end sits at the opposite corner and cut flat. You want to tuck this tube inside of the rectangle from bent corner to bent corner. This will give the bottom support.\r\n13. Lay the left over piece of the tube, diagonally,\u00a0in an empty corner and mark where it meets the crossing tube. Cut the tube diagonally so it will lay flush with the center tube and tuck it in place.\r\n14. Cut the 4th tube end flat and repeat the last step for the remaining corner.\r\n15. Cover the sticky side of this piece with colored duct tape.\r\n16. Make 3 more tubes and use the left over piece of tube where ever necessary. Repeat steps 2 - 15 to make the box top. Make sure tubes are the same size as for the box bottom.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FRA/656G/GAPUWXSR/FRA656GGAPUWXSR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYT/9JN1/GAPUWXS5/FYT9JN1GAPUWXS5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGV/TUDJ/GAPUWXSC/FGVTUDJGAPUWXSC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4Y/E8GC/GAPUWXSB/F4YE8GCGAPUWXSB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4N/RA7Q/GAPUWXSA/F4NRA7QGAPUWXSA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOX/140D/GAPUWXS9/FOX140DGAPUWXS9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCT/MDLM/GAPUWXS8/FCTMDLMGAPUWXS8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZU/9E4L/GAPUWXSX/FZU9E4LGAPUWXSX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXP/FMKU/GAPUWXSW/FXPFMKUGAPUWXSW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMM/IXLE/GAPUWXSV/FMMIXLEGAPUWXSV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7M/QN1K/GAPUWXSU/F7MQN1KGAPUWXSU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAL/3BTW/GAPUWXST/FAL3BTWGAPUWXST.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA7/ORHU/GAPUWXSS/FA7ORHUGAPUWXSS.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Making the Bottom and Top of the Box."}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "17.

One-way eyes. We wanted the clearest vision possible, while still preventing people from seeing through from the outside.\u00a0 We also wanted them to 'sparkle' a bit, if possible; but without the use of embedded lights.\u00a0 I've done a couple of i'bles involving lights, and I decided I'm over the darn things (lights), even though I still love them in a slightly obsessed way.\nWe're hoping to learn how to make a complete fursuit. We already bought the fur!\u00a0 We bunched it around the eye for the photo.\u00a0\nThings like mesh, pantyhose or thin fabric;\u00a0they all seem to cause vision impairment when it comes to putting them over your eyes.\u00a0 Last year, we made a costume where\u00a0we used\u00a0pantyhose to cover the area that the wearer was supposed to 'see' out of, but his vision was still seriously restricted.\u00a0 So how were we going to make some 'eyes' that afforded 20/20 vision (or as close to it as possible)?\nFor starters, we eyeballed our cat. She eyeballed us back, suspiciously.\nAfter eyeballing our cat, we\u2019ve come up with these\u00a0quick and easy, one-way see-through\u00a0eyes that give the wearer pretty good vision.\u00a0No fine mesh.\u00a0 No\u00a0pantyhose balaclavas like last year's costume.\u00a0 Just\u00a0colour filter, window/windscreen film,\u00a0clear acrylic orbs, and not much else!\nThis\u00a0amazing tutorial here, for Spiderman one-way eye lenses, helped me out a LOT, by putting the idea into my head about mirror tint as used on windows and cars.", "title": "Fursuit Eyes You Can See Out Of!", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Animal-Eyes-easy-quick-and-cheap/", "section": "home", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "1 clear acrylic orb, 10cm (about 4 inches) in diameter.\n1 sheet of colour filter (also known as COLOUR GEL), in the colour of your choice.

We got half a metre for $12 from a stage lighting store. Again, it\u2019s possible to get cheap offcuts. But we couldn\u2019t find any in the colour we wanted.\nAt 10cm in diameter, the plastic/acrylic orbs we\u2019re using may seem oversized, but they\u2019re suitable for the largish head that we\u2019re making.

Using an exacto knife or a box cutter, cut the slit on the front face that you just marked with a pen. Be careful not to cut into the bottom face of the box. You can put something like a piece of wood into the box to cut into and stop the knife from cutting through to the bottom of the box. 3) Use duct tape to tape up the bottom of the box.

Steve for Halloween\u2026.  I have looked at many tutorials, Instructables and store bought versions of the infamous Steve head. While they all have their specific technique and strengths to creating; I consistently find one area lacking.  The stability once the box is placed over the head.  A flat shape just doesn't sit securely on a round object, specifically one that is moving around.  Maybe that's trivial in the grand scheme of being Steve, but it causes safety issues and I have childhood memories of masks not fitting properly and bouncing around on my head while I valiantly tried to see out misaligned eye holes and continuously pulled the mask back to it's proper place.  It's a wonder I survived all my visually impaired Halloween nights to create this Instructable at all.  My quick solution could definitely be modified to an actual fitted head harness or something more sturdy but for a pretty quick build I think it does the trick so long as the child/adult isn't running or wrestling wildly about\u2026.  Lastly I'm going to outline my steps using the equipment I have regular access to as a graphic designer in a production environment.   You may need to adapt or adjust certain steps to complete your Steve if you don't have the same resources.  So lets get started.Things you will need:- Access to print your Steve skin directly or an outside source for producing- Photo editing or manipulation software (Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator)- Large format HP Printer- 50\" roll of printable adhesive vinyl- Laminating Machine and laminate- A square cardboard box 12\" or larger- Exacto knike or box cutter- 1\" thick foam padding approx 4' wide x height (the size of your box)- Duct and masking tape- Spray adhesive- Window perforated vinyl- Blue permanaent Marker- Patience!!!!", "title": "Minecraft Steve Stable Head Build ", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Minecraft-Steve-Stable-Head-Build/", "section": "home", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The first thing you will need to do is find a papercraft Steve file online you can use to print your Steve skin or create one yourself.  I googled Papercraft Steve then narrowed my search by file type and resolution until I found files I could use to build my own.  I will provide the files I found along with a pdf of the print file I created.  Once you locate the files you'll need to open and arrange them using whatever software you have into a print file.  I used Adobe Illustrator to build my file.  Make sure to measure your box accurately and prepare your files at 100% print size.  You'll want to make sure all your printed sides will completely cover the sides of the box and to be safe I'd even include some extra bleed in case any shifting occurs as you apply your skin.  (Bleed is extra printed area beyond where you intend to cut.  It assures you cover everything and have no white lines or cardboard box showing.)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FIC/40A4/I1NUFLQL/FIC40A4I1NUFLQL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD2/S9GG/I1NUFP76/FD2S9GGI1NUFP76.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFI/OXF5/I1NUFP7Z/FFIOXF5I1NUFP7Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5R/VIW7/I1NUFP80/F5RVIW7I1NUFP80.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTP/XOCT/I1NUFP8O/FTPXOCTI1NUFP8O.LARGE.jpg", "/assets/img/pixel.png"], "step_title": "Step 1: Creating Your Steve Skin Print File"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Once you have your print file prepared it's time to print it.  If you don't have access or the ability to print the panels yourself you'll need to go to Kinkos or someplace similar and have them professionally done for you.  Take your file on a flash drive and tell them what you want.  I printed mine on printable adhesive vinyl that way it was all one big decal that I applied. Think of it as wrapping paper with a sticky back.  After my piece was printed I laminated it so it would be more durable and resistant to water, scratches and being easily damaged.  Another option you could do is print or separate the panel into individual sides and apply them.  You'll have more edge seams and it'll be more prone to pealing up on the corners and edges but it will be easier to apply for beginers.  Also you can print plain paper and then apply adhesive spray to the back then lay the panels down.  This approach will be very fragile to water or pretty much anything if you chose to use it so be warned.

You'll have to push and work much harder which leaves room for getting cut or slipping.  I always use new blades and change them often.

So what is the simple solution you ask\u2026.  Make a nest for your head to rest.  Do you think a mother bird would try to set her round baby eggs on a hard flat surface NO!!!!!  So don't expect the flat box to balance on your round noggin.  It's not gonna happen.  First thing I did was cut a square foam piece slightly smaller than the inside of your box.  Keep in mind this will be the inside top of Steve's head.  - The hole will only allow the top of the head to rest securely like and egg.  the circle is 5 - 5 1/2\" wide.  - I then cut out the circle carefully with my utility knife and removed the piece.  This left the hole.  - I then took the round piece I just removed and cut it in half horizontally like you're separating the top and bottom of a bagel.  I then cut one of those halfs into four equal pie like pieces that will be used later as well as the remaining circle piece.  - Next I cut another square foam piece the same as the first.  Then I sprayed adhesive to the piece with the hole in it then sandwiched the two pieces together.  Be careful to keep adhesive out of the hole because your head rests there.Lastly flip those two pieces over to reveal a flat foam surface where you will attach the (4) pie shaped pieces with spray adhesive in the corners like legs on a table.  you'll attach the remaining circle to the middle for more stability and padding for your head. - Now apply spray adhesive to the bottom (4) corner leg pieces and the middle circle piece as these will be the contact points for inside the box.- Flip the whole piece over and gently position it (adhesive side down) into the box apply firm downward pressure.  You will now see that you have created a nest for your head to rest and a stable flat surface for the box to sit.  Additionally you have centered where the head will rest within the box while lining up where your eyes will line up with the cut out eye holes.

I did it this way so you can still easy spray the entire sheet with adhesive and then separate into strips verses having to spray them individually and making a sticky mess everywhere. I made my strips about 1 inch wide and 9-10 inches long so they would easily fit inside the box without obstructing anything.  After I scored/cut so I could see how many I'd get from each sheet I separated them completely with my exacto knife.  Then starting with one side of the box I evenly spaced and applied the strips.  I started with the middle strip then repeated 1 inch gap, then 1 inch foam until I had five on all sides except inside the face side.  This area you will leave blank so it is easy to see out.

You'll want to too the same thing for the other seam on this side of the box.

Look for notes on the pics to explain whats shown.  So as I mentioned in an earlier step my Steve skin for the head is actually printed onto laminated adhesive vinyl.  (This basically means it is one big sticker/decal like wrapping paper.  Once I get it into the proper position I'll need to remove the backing paper with reveals the sticky surface that will stick to the outside of the box.  If you didn't use my approach you'll have to apply with some spray adhesive and will most likely need to do each side separately.Beginning with picture (1) you'll see the first thing I did was position my skin over the box and checked all the sides so I knew everything would cover properly and line up.  Then I taped it into position so It wouldn't move.  At this point no backer paper has been removed and all the decals adhesive is protected and covered by that backer paper which is the bright white you see.  I won't remove that until right before I'm ready to apply that side.Next I began to apply one side at a time beginning with the sides that had overlapping flaps that would wrap around a corner.  You can see in picture (2) that two sides have been applied with the dark flaps wrapping around the corner.  This also provides bleed so no box shows through and reinforces the sticker from pealing up.Picture (3) shows the process of separating the adhesive from the backer paper prior to applying it to the flat box surface.  I use a plastic squeegee like you'd use for applying vinyl to glass to push the air out from under the surface moving slowly from one side to the other.  Air under the surface creates a bubble and looks bad.  You can also use your hand or a rag with consistent pressure just make sure you work from on side to the other pushing the air out as you go.Picture (4) shows that I'm getting ready to fold down a flap that wraps a corner from the side to the top of the head.  Then I will remove the backer paper and fold the top side of Steve's head down which will conceal the flaps.Picture (5) shows the completed applied skin to the front and sides.  All that remains is to trim the white flap area off with an exact knife and it will be ready to move onto the next step.Picture (6) finished wrapping!!! YES!!!!!!!

Now all the reinforcing we did in earlier steps will make sense because it's time to use some force and cutting technical skill to reveal all the work that has already been done to make this awesome!!First you'll need to measure how big your kids mellon is. Then add a couple inches in Diameter to make sure it's big enough.  In picture (2) you'll see a black box that is not big enough for a head to fit through\u2026.  Then you'll see a white drawn line outside of that black box.  That is the cutline for the area to be removed.  Next get the sharpest utility or exacto blade you have and begin to cut out the box on that white line see picture (3).  Since we reinforced it so well and glued everything together you'll be cutting through two layers of cardboard.  It's actually pretty easy though because everything is constructed to sturdy.  Cut out from the corners first so they are completely through and neat.  Then connect your cut lines in the middle.  When it's all done the piece should just pop out revealing the awesome inside structure and padding of picture (4)!!Lastly in picture (5) you can see that I applied strips of black duct tape to the sides of the cut out box so it's smooth and doesn't cause any paper or cardboard cuts when putting on or wearing Steves head.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FF9/PJ3N/I1NEFFE6/FF9PJ3NI1NEFFE6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUA/Q2FH/I1NEFFE8/FUAQ2FHI1NEFFE8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS8/Z3XD/I1NEFFHO/FS8Z3XDI1NEFFHO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F32/LYCG/I1NEFFHP/F32LYCGI1NEFFHP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGH/0UTO/I1NEFFJP/FGH0UTOI1NEFFJP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Cutting Out the Square for a Head."}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "When you begin this step you will have two square eye holes that need to be removed.

From what I've seen there is some pretty cool and original customization that I do in this step that isn't offered or done on any other Steve head anywhere.  Yes I just made that bold claim and I'm confidant in it:)  So go ahead remove those eye holes.  When you are done you will have what you see in picture (4)  good but not AWESOME\u2026..  A cardboard Steve head with not a glimmer of life in his eyes\u2026..  This bothered me very much and isn't how Steve looks.  So I began to experiment and brainstorm trying several ideas on how to add the blue color to Steve's eyes without interfering with safety and vision.  I settled on white perforated window vinyl as seen in picture (5) then tested permanent blue marker colors on it until I was satisfied.  This stuff is the same as the other vinyl I used with an adhesive back and backer paper.  It works by being a 50/50 pattern of holes and vinyl that doesn't vision and is used on buses and other application stat want a see through graphic.  Anyway in picture (6) you can see the marker colored vinyl.  I then bordered it with masking tape sticky side the same direction as the blue as seem in picture (7).  Then I positioned the two blue eye colors inside the Steve head over the eye holes as seen in pictures (8 and 9) and rubbed down the tape to hold them in place.  TADA!!!

Just like applying green concealer over a red blemish to make it disappear, we'll be using the OPPOSITE color of your dark undereye circles to make them disappear.Simply apply a salmon or orange-toned concealer to your undereye area before applying your foundation.  Voila! Most dark or black tones in the skin read as blue or have blue undertones, and orange is the color directly opposite blue on the color wheel and can therefore be used to neutralize your undereye circles. If your undereye circles look more purple (a trait of very fair skintones), you will need something that's more lemon-yellow.If your undereye area is super dry, first apply a hydrating eye cream, then once that has absorbed into the skin, apply an eyeshadow primer (like Urban Decay Primer Potion or Too Faced Shadow Insurance) to the area before applying your concealer. Lighter skintones will need a softer apricot or peachy concealer, while darker skintones will need to go right for a vibrant orange concealer.  Nearly every brand at every price point carries a concealer in the color you need, from Benefit (check out Erase Paste), to NYX (found in beauty supply stores, Targets, and drug stores across the world), to MAC, to Bobbi Brown... the list is endless! My favorite is the Eve Pearl Salmon Concealer.  The one I carry in my kit has three orangey concealer colors, tailored to light, medium, and dark skintones so that I can cover dark circles on anyone no matter what their skintone.  She also carries a version that actually treats the causes of dark circles, and an excellent dual concealer compact that has the salmon-colored concealer and a flesh-colored concealer to brighten and to cover other areas on the face that may need concealing.

Moisturize: Moisturize around your eye area. We recommend DDF's Advanced Eye Firming Concentrate.\n2. Base Eyeshadows: Start with the light color from CoverGirl's Eye Enhancers 3-Kit shadow pallet and apply to the top eyelid. Next switch to the pink and apply it in the crease. Finally, take the green and apply a small amount on the outside corner of your eye. For more pop you can apply the green along the whole lash line.\n3. Black Eyeshadow: Apply a black eyeshadow like CoverGirl's Eye Enhancer's 1-Kit Shadow in Shimmering Onyx on the outer corner and in the crease to intensify the look. Be sure to blend well.\n4. Eyeliner: Apply eyeliner to the top and bottom lash lines. Here we used CoverGirl's Liquiline Blast Eyeliner.\n5. Mascara: Apply CoverGirl's LashBlast Volume mascara to both the top and bottom lashes.\n6. LIps: Use a nude lip color from CoverGirl's Lip Perfection Lipcolors to avoid clashing with the bright eye colors.", "title": "The New Bright Eye Color Trend", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/The-New-Bright-Eye-Color-Trend/", "section": "home", "steps": [], "channel": "No channel to show"}, {"category": "No category to show", "description": "http://www.styleunited.com/TipsAndTrends/article/How-to-Highlight-Your-Face\u00a0 This video shows you how to define your face by highlighting.\u00a0\nStep-by-Step:\n1.

Get ready: Even out your skin tone with foundation, if needed.\n4. Less is more: Use a circular motion to apply highlighter to your cheekbones, and up-and-down motions for your nose and forehead, chin and cupid's bow.

Color OLED operate in 14 V, it means you need a dedicate step-up circuit, but it is not a problem if you simply use with a break-out board. LCD in most case can direct operate in 3.3 V, the same operating voltage as ESP32, so you can consider not use break out board to make a slimmer product.SoftwareSoftware support on the other side also influence your selection. You can develop ESP32 program with Arduino IDE or direct use ESP-IDF.

I just HAD to be Ninja Turtle and I just HAD to come to that decision two weeks before Halloween. Nice job, self.Reference materials, tutorials, templates, and appropriate creditI wanted to go with the Nickelodeon TMNT version, not only because kids would be more familiar with them, but also because I figured the hand and feet fabrication would be easier to replicate in EVA foam.While searching online for a slew of reference photos, I quickly found an existing Nickelodeon TMNT Instructable by nbehling. The Instructable is great and gave me lots of design and fabrication inspiration. You'll notice that I replicated his leg design.The wild card for me was the turtle head. The truth is ... I'm not very good at mentally dissecting compound curvatures in order to know how to rebuild a shape. I can visualize the exploded view of square and rectangular construction (houses, furniture, etc), as well as simple shapes like a dome or sphere, but a realistic character head is currently out of reach. I decided to search for existing templates and found some great Pepakura files posted by Nintendude. You'll notice that I translated his patterns to work with foam.Building MaterialsThe majority of this costume is constructed using EVA foam floor mats (both the puzzle and rolled style), which I acquired from Harbor Freight. 1/8\" craft foam was acquired from Michael's (the craft store ... not my neighbor who borrowed a screwdriver, which he failed to turn. Damn you Michael!!).

After a few changes and notes, the prototype was dissected and used to make poster board templates. The top of the arm and two fingers are one piece. The prototype helped determine that this would be stronger than having a glue joint between the palm and fingers, which is the point of flex. Two layers of 1\" foam strips were laminated to the finger tips, cut flush with the finger sides, and a bevel added to the front for shaping [Fig. 1-5]. The thumb is a separate template and piece so that it can be cut to the appropriate length and positioned during a fitting. The same technique is used for the tip, but the sides are boxed in using small sections of foam for the sides and 1/8\" foam for the bottom [Fig. 6]. The prototype proved that a strap didn't provide enough support and control for the thumb, which will make more sense very shortly.The second part of the arm is a 10 1/2\" square piece of foam with a semi-circular notch removed, which allows your arm to bend at the elbow. One side gets glued to an underside edge of the arm top, bent into an arc, and then glued to the opposing underside edge [Fig. 8-9]. Just be mindful of the notch placement and glue the second arm up as a mirror image [Fig. 10].1/8\" craft foam was used for strapping. A loop for each finger and a larger loop for the palm. These help keep the foam hand tight to your own hand and make it possible to curl the fingers. Placement and length will depend on the size of the individual hand [Fig. 11-12].Once the hand was complete, I was able to put it on and mark not only the distance of the thumb from the finger, but also the angle at which to cut the foam. The thumb was then glued in place and I laminated a strip of 1/8\" foam to the interior face to reinforce the seam [Fig. 13-14].", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F0D/SUO9/J98RM1PZ/F0DSUO9J98RM1PZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQP/7PGZ/J98RM1Q0/FQP7PGZJ98RM1Q0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7J/7WJ9/J98RM1QO/F7J7WJ9J98RM1QO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1E/QJLV/J98RM1RA/F1EQJLVJ98RM1RA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTO/JWI9/J98RM1RL/FTOJWI9J98RM1RL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPI/A4AX/J98RM1RT/FPIA4AXJ98RM1RT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVO/VGGJ/J98RM1RV/FVOVGGJJ98RM1RV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJE/OXQQ/J98RM1RX/FJEOXQQJ98RM1RX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX3/YL7H/J98RM1S8/FX3YL7HJ98RM1S8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNQ/G38B/J98RM1S9/FNQG38BJ98RM1S9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJK/ZQQC/J98RM1T7/FJKZQQCJ98RM1T7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5G/6AKS/J98RM1T6/F5G6AKSJ98RM1T6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMM/I77L/J98RM1T8/FMMI77LJ98RM1T8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4T/YOJP/J98RM1TK/F4TYOJPJ98RM1TK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F36/C8KH/J9JFEK2P/F36C8KHJ9JFEK2P.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: The Arms and Hands"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "As with the arm, I made a prototype leg to work out the bugs and make templates. I used my shoe to assist with sizing while determining the dimension and shape of the sole. My curved cuts left a bit to be desired, so I cleaned up the shape using the oscillating belt sander.The leg shape is cut from a single piece of foam with the seam in the back. There is a notch in the front top for knee movement, the ankle is open,  and a good portion of the back is left open.  This design results in unhindered mobility - very easy to walk and even crouch down.The sides of the foot are built up using 2\" wide strips of foam. The mats aren't large enough to do this with one piece, so I determined a splicing point and used two - a full strip around the back and then a shorter strip to fill in the front. A second full strip was then added to the front to reinforce the splice points, add rigidity, and provide more backing material for upcoming toe cuts.I wasn't sure how to get the proper toe shape, so I pinned the leg to the foot and made a few attempts with contractor paper until I got it right. The toe edge gets a bottom bevel and the ankle edge gets a top bevel [Fig. 8].  To keep the parts centered, during assembly, I started in the middle and worked out towards the ends. A fillet of hot glue was added to the inside of this seam, which is probably overkill, but it makes me feel better.To secure the turtle appendage to my foot, I used nylon strapping and plastic buckles, which can be purchased online, but I've also seen them at Lowes. After a few tests, I found the best anchor point to be the back center and glued to the sole.  I used barge on the faces and then flooded the edges with hot glue. A walking test revealed a tendency for my toe to raise up, so I added some foam blocking to eliminate that possibility [Fig. 13].The leg was glued to the foot in the same manner as the toe - center and work your way to the edges.  You could leave the ankle open, but I chose to fill the void with a softer/more flexible foam so that when I wrapped the leg in spandex, I didn't end up with any unsightly indentations.  I used hot glue for this because barge was just too tricky.Lastly, the toe locations were laid using a seamstress tape to offset them equally from the center and then cut them out with a razor knife.  This is where that second row of foam earns its paycheck by providing enough depth for the cuts, while leaving backing material to which spandex can be adhered.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F7U/NY2L/J98RM1YS/F7UNY2LJ98RM1YS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGQ/ZCGE/J98RM1YY/FGQZCGEJ98RM1YY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOI/KSTI/J98RM1YT/FOIKSTIJ98RM1YT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F75/SF0T/J98RM1ZC/F75SF0TJ98RM1ZC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9B/TDGR/J98RM1ZN/F9BTDGRJ98RM1ZN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVE/OF4A/J98RM1ZO/FVEOF4AJ98RM1ZO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8H/AHVH/J98RM1ZW/F8HAHVHJ98RM1ZW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7P/01F1/J98RM201/F7P01F1J98RM201.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9H/4JJN/J98RM20D/F9H4JJNJ98RM20D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEF/V4TE/J98RM20J/FEFV4TEJ98RM20J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F79/A6AP/J98RM20E/F79A6APJ98RM20E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJG/63Y8/J98RM20H/FJG63Y8J98RM20H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDX/J3C5/J98RM214/FDXJ3C5J98RM214.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FII/NJ0K/J98RM215/FIINJ0KJ98RM215.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWA/8IH1/J98RM218/FWA8IH1J98RM218.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTX/H8OH/J98RM21D/FTXH8OHJ98RM21D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F35/E4WV/J9EGY3SX/F35E4WVJ9EGY3SX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB0/DRHI/J9EGY3PY/FB0DRHIJ9EGY3PY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FES/1PCD/J9EGY3RG/FES1PCDJ9EGY3RG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHN/4Q27/J9EGYH9G/FHN4Q27J9EGYH9G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNX/A3L4/J9JFEK4Q/FNXA3L4J9JFEK4Q.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: The Legs and Feet"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "As previously mentioned, I used Pepakura files to help my wrap my mind around this cranium.

The bottom section could be pressed flat and cut from one piece [Fig. 3], while the top section just needed two darts cut in order to be flattened [Fig. 4]. That reduced the thirteen pieces from the Pepakura file down to four.Two new parts were cut out and glued together in order to ensure they maintained the desired shape. A haphazard mock I shall call \"Frankenhead,\" was used to enlarge the bottom hole so that my head could actually squeeze inside [Fig. 6]. Once that was achieved, I dissected the head, made poster board templates, and cut four new parts out of foam.Note: Remember to flip templates if/when you need left and right/mirrored parts.I glued up the top and bottom of the head separately and then joined the two sub assemblies - as opposed to left and right hemispheres.

It's probably been done before, but it works so well, it be a pity not to share.I used 2\" wide strips of foam - one running over my head -  side to side, and one running behind my head - side to side.

You wand the back strip to cradle your head.  Too long and the fit is too loose/big ... too short and the fit is too tight/small.The strips are glued together where their ends meet and the entire assembly is glued inside the foam head, but only at the top center location.  The beauty of having the sides free floating is that you can add a piece or pieces of foam as a shim to snug up the fit.  With no shim, the sides have room to flare out a bit, so this foam head can accommodate several human head sizes.A small block of softer foam was added to the front - inline with the my forehead.

Picture showed billboard ... description said billboard ... they were NOT billboard.  They also fell apart in my hands almost immediately.  Without the luxury of time, I push on with the standard lenses and formulated an alternate plan.I found an adequately, pupil sized washer and traced it onto some masking tape, which in turn was adhered to packing tape.  The packing tape was folded over on itself, so not sticky, and in effect became a large sticker.  I cut out a few circles, separated the masking tape from the packing tape backer, obsessively placed them on the lenses, and then pressed them down.  Two light coats of plastic primer followed by three light coats of white spray paint ensued [Fig. 1-5].While the white paint dried, I made a second mask with a larger washer.  This time I stuck the packing tape to paper instead of folding it over on itself, which was faster and easier.  In this instance, the circle cut out is the waste portion so that a ring of color can be sprayed without tainting the sclera portion of the eye.  Three light coats of blue spray paint, two light coats of spray lacquer to lock it in and prevent finger prints (learned from experience), and then carefully peel off the masking tape.  The blue bled onto the white a bit, but only noticeable close up [Fig. 6-20].Before painting the lenses, I used them to trace the eye locations onto the head.  It could be done afterwards, but, but I wanted to cut out the holes while paint was drying.  The holes were roughly (very roughly) cut and then sanded to the line with a Dremel and sanding drum [Fig. 11-12].Note: The holes are just a tad smaller than the lenses so they can be glued to the foam exterior.  If you recess them, they will have a sunken look by the time you add the mask.Overall, this approach worked, but the lenses kept fogging up, which blocked all visibility.  Billboard/perforated lenses would've been ideal and I'll probably end up drilling out the pupil to eliminate the issue.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FAW/FHKH/J9EGXIOT/FAWFHKHJ9EGXIOT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKV/OWV2/J9EGXIZE/FKVOWV2J9EGXIZE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY0/PUZ9/J9EGXJ89/FY0PUZ9J9EGXJ89.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFD/FMLV/J9EGXJDP/FFDFMLVJ9EGXJDP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4H/GIF0/J9EGXJGU/F4HGIF0J9EGXJGU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIX/IIT7/J9EGXJJC/FIXIIT7J9EGXJJC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQO/RQ2Q/J9EGXJPB/FQORQ2QJ9EGXJPB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFB/DUGL/J9EGXJSI/FFBDUGLJ9EGXJSI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6J/89H4/J9EGXJUK/F6J89H4J9EGXJUK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUR/OQP1/J9EHFJTK/FUROQP1J9EHFJTK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXC/3S3R/J9EGXMF4/FXC3S3RJ9EGXMF4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW1/UCJ3/J9EGXMIQ/FW1UCJ3J9EGXMIQ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: The Head - Eyes"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Wrapping a spandex mask around the head would've been quick and effective, but visually, I wanted it to have a bit more thickness.  Since I wanted to use 1/8 foam, which would need to contour with the shape of the head, I decided to make a template instead of winging it with several free drawn attempts.To make the template, I covered the head with aluminum foil (trust me on the foil), applied masking tape, and drew a mask onto half of the head.  Once satisfied, I removed the tape/foil, cut out the shape, and transferred it to poster board.  Using this template, I traced out a left and right side of the mask (flip the template) onto 1/8\" foam, cut them out, and glued them together in the center [Fig. 1-5].The mask was skinned with orange spandex. A light coat of Super 77 on the foam held things in place well enough to cut the spandex, wrap it around to the backside of the mask, and lock it in place with hot glue [Fig. 6-10].I did cut excess length at the ends so I could tie the mask in the back and have the spandex freely hang like banners in the breeze.  Sadly, the spandex just rolled up on itself and looked like two oversized penne (type of pasta - not a typo). A better plan may be to cut that excess wider and added a 1/8\" foam core.The mask gets attached to the head in four locations with Velcro (front, each side, and back) [Fig. 13].  Making the mask removable enables switching out for other colors, which correlates to other turtles.

Moving it higher and lower affected the overall look more than one would imagine.  Once I finally decided on a location, I traced the template onto the foam, cut out the mouth with a razor knife, and cleaned it up with a sanding drum to remove any tool marks and round over the edges.For teeth, I used two strips of 1/8\" white craft foam, which were hot glued to the inside of the head.

I decided to start with the chest plate so I could size it to my human body and then use it to help determine the size of the shell.After measuring the distance from my collar bone to a lower distance which concealed my private turtle parts, I drew several layout lines on contractor paper - vertical center, top, bottom, armpit, nipple, navel, etc. These lines were guides for the overall shape - where curves would start, where the belt would fall, and where the form would be separated into 6 tiles. Once I had the final shape, I cut it and and transferred it to a poster board template.  The paper shape was then cut down the middle, one side split into the three separate tiles, and then those transferred to poster board [Fig. 1-4].Note: Once you have your desired shape on one side of the paper, just cut out that half, fold it along the vertical center, and trace it onto the opposing half.Note 2: The chest plate has 6 tiles, but you only need templates for one side. Just flip them to get the mirror image.I fabricated the chest plate as two layers, which will make sense as we progress. A full chest shape was cut from a rolled mat and the six individual tiles were cut from the stiffer puzzle foam. Inside edges of the tiles were rounded over, while the outside edges received a wider chamfer. Battle damage was added using the edge of the sanding drum [Fig. 5-7].The tiles were wrapped with tan spandex, but since it was somewhat transparent and the tiles had markings from an ink pen, I first heat sealed them and then applied two coats of Plasti Dip. Sections of spandex were cut oversize and stuck to the front of the tiles with Super 77. I ensured the spandex followed the contours of the battle damage, wrapped around the sides wrinkle free, and then secured all the edges on the backside with hot glue [Fig. 8-11]The full chest shape received the heat seal and Plasti Dip treatment to cover up ink markings and then the individual tiles were attached using Barge. I'm very pleased with this method as it gives the desired depth to the part and when it's worn, the tiles separate a bit to reveal the black substrate [Fig. 12-14]The chest plate needed a spot of Velcro for attaching the belt. I initially tried to attach it directly to the spandex, but it was short lived. Since I didn't want to trash my work with hot glue, I made an over complicated anchor point using 1/8\" and plexi. I glued a small rectangle of plexi to the middle of a foam strip [Fig. 15] and continued wrapping around to the backside until the foam met in the middle and was then spot glued to itself - think of the letter T. The vertical section of this foam T was fed through a slit in the vertical center of the chest plate.  The two flaps of foam were then glued to the back of the chest plate using Barge [Fig. 17 & 18]. This won't hold a lot of weight, but it's enough for it's intended purpose and unlike the spandex, the Velco actually sticks to the foam.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FMX/P9BQ/J9EGXRE6/FMXP9BQJ9EGXRE6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6J/DC5D/J9EGXRF9/F6JDC5DJ9EGXRF9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZU/TLF8/J9EGXRI7/FZUTLF8J9EGXRI7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3B/L876/J9EGXRJR/F3BL876J9EGXRJR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWU/7XM2/J9EGXRM0/FWU7XM2J9EGXRM0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIV/A5US/J9EGXRMW/FIVA5USJ9EGXRMW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBF/42OK/J9EGXRP6/FBF42OKJ9EGXRP6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX2/MCS9/J9EGXRV2/FX2MCS9J9EGXRV2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDA/TPNN/J9EGXRZ2/FDATPNNJ9EGXRZ2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVV/8UUH/J9EGXRZS/FVV8UUHJ9EGXRZS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUD/IPDL/J9EGXS2E/FUDIPDLJ9EGXS2E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA6/WL2D/J9EGXS75/FA6WL2DJ9EGXS75.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRK/6CL4/J9EGXS8B/FRK6CL4J9EGXS8B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ1/WQOR/J9EGXS8Q/FJ1WQORJ9EGXS8Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL6/QV65/J9EHEXYY/FL6QV65J9EHEXYY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHK/WAXX/J9EHEXYZ/FHKWAXXJ9EHEXYZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB2/9QMZ/J9EHEXZ2/FB29QMZJ9EHEXZ2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS6/7BAO/J9EHEXZ3/FS67BAOJ9EHEXZ3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC0/KP57/J9EHEXZ4/FC0KP57J9EHEXZ4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F66/XHJK/J9IRF4RL/F66XHJKJ9IRF4RL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F82/T3FF/J9JFEK8O/F82T3FFJ9JFEK8O.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: The Chest Plate"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "To get the vertical and horizontal dimensions for the back shell, I temporarily strapped on the chest piece with assistance from a bungee cord and held a tape measure behind my back ... all in front of a mirror. It was truly a magically frustrating exercise.  Contractor paper was once again used as my sketch pad as I progressed through 3-4 versions. I'd draw one half, trace it to the other half, cut it out, check myself out in the mirror, and then make necessary revisions. Once I had a base shape, I glued two floor mats together and cut out a foam base [Fig. 1-3].Note: At this point, I cut the paper template in half vertically and made a poster board template.To support the dome, I made a centered spine.  After deciding on a measurement for the highest point of the dome, which is the center, I drew a gradual taper to the edge.  This pattern was used to cut 4 pieces out of foam, which were then glued into a 2 ply lamination and the top edge rounded using a sanding drum [Fig. 4-6].  For additional dome support, I added 2\" wide foam strips on each side [Fig. 7].For the actual dome, I used rolled floor mat, which is a bit thinner and a lot more flexible than the puzzle style mats. Using the shell base template, I traced and cut out one half of the dome. I knew this piece would be too large, but it would get me in the ballpark and could be easily trimmed.  After beveling the bottom edge with the sanding drum, I temporarily pinned the foam in place, marked true center with a flexible metal ruler, and trimmed the foam [Fig. 9-10]. This newly shaped piece was then traced onto foam to make the opposing side (smooth side to smooth side for the mirror image), as well as on to poster board for a keeper template.This glue up was a bit precarious, so I split it into sections [Fig. 11-12]:1. Center Top - sides to each other and the top of the spine.2. Each side to the 2\" foam strip supports - started at the top and worked down.3. Vertical spine - sides to each other and the top of the spine - started at the top and worked down.4. The bottom edge of the dome to the base - top half .. then bottom half.Halfway through gluing the bottom edge to the base, I decided that there was too much flex in the foam - it was actually dipping down a bit in a few spots. I was aware that previous builders used expandable foam for this purpose, but my solution was fiberglass insulation.  Expandable foam can be messy, it takes time to cure, overfilling was a risk, and I already had insulation.  After stuffing this turkey, I finished gluing the bottom edge to the base {fig. 13-16].Note: Since I cut the first dome half in place, I ended up with a beveled top edge and had to mirror that on the other side.  This left a sharp ridge, which I sanded down with the dremel.  In hindsight, I would not bevel this edge and just alter my template.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWZ/J55O/J9EGXWVC/FWZJ55OJ9EGXWVC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6I/9ZUH/J9EGXWVI/F6I9ZUHJ9EGXWVI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F98/ZAD1/J9EGXWZJ/F98ZAD1J9EGXWZJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWZ/E6H4/J9EGXWVM/FWZE6H4J9EGXWVM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F03/AKHS/J9EGXWWN/F03AKHSJ9EGXWWN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7G/K3KC/J9EGXWYN/F7GK3KCJ9EGXWYN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPO/F1H6/J9EGXWZO/FPOF1H6J9EGXWZO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE7/1XUT/J9EGXWZR/FE71XUTJ9EGXWZR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVS/EX3D/J9EGXX5R/FVSEX3DJ9EGXX5R.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTA/YG15/J9EGXXBP/FTAYG15J9EGXXBP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF6/LGE0/J9EGXXF5/FF6LGE0J9EGXXF5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FML/7WX0/J9EGXXFA/FML7WX0J9EGXXFA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGC/UYDE/J9EGXXKF/FGCUYDEJ9EGXXKF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBY/SJBL/J9EGXXKL/FBYSJBLJ9EGXXKL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3O/DTTQ/J9EGXXKP/F3ODTTQJ9EGXXKP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F45/NKWK/J9EGXXKQ/F45NKWKJ9EGXXKQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO9/0KP5/J9JFEOAG/FO90KP5J9JFEOAG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: The Shell - Basic Shape"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "It seemed logical that the quickest and most accurate way to layout the shell tiles would be to do it directly on the shell.  I covered the dome with masking tape, laid down a few horizontal reference lines, and started scribbling away.  I thought I'd be able to easily peel off the masking tape since it's usually gentle on painted surfaces, but that assumption was proven to be false - learn from my mistake and lay down an aluminum foil barrier prior to the tape (mistake was not repeated on the head).After arduously peeling up each tile and cut them free with scissors, they were used to make poster board templates (four center templates and three side templates, which I just flipped for the opposing side). Each tile received rounded edges courtesy of the sanding drum and an under bevel on the edge adjacent to the base layer [Fig. 2].While testing the fit/spacing of the tiles, it became apparent that the base layer was undersized. The reference photos showed a wider rim around the entire shell, which I lacked. My solution was to cut out segments of foam, glue them them the existing edge, and then conceal the visible seam with a layer of 1/8\" foam. The easiest way to get properly fitting pieces was to trace the shell onto contractor paper [Fig. 3], draw a 1 1/5\" offset from this line, split that larger egg ring into segments, cut out the individual segments, and use them as templates for marking and cutting the foam [Fig. 4]. The 1/8\" foam was then cut to fit and adhered with Barge [Fig. 5-7].Gluing on the tiles was pretty straight forward. I started with the bottom and top center tiles, filled in with the three side tiles (maintaining an equal spacing), and finished with the two center tiles [Fig. 8-9].Reference photos show a V notch between each of the shell's edge segments, so I used a small piece of foam as a consistent marking gauge and cut them out with a razor knife. A few additional notches are cut at the top of the shell to simulate battle damage and then a bevel was added to the outside edge. Additional cuts, chips, and scars of war were inflicted on the foam using the edge of the sanding drum [Fig. 10-13].", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQD/YV91/J9EGXYPN/FQDYV91J9EGXYPN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN7/SJ2G/J9EGXYPQ/FN7SJ2GJ9EGXYPQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8D/EAO2/J9EGXYRJ/F8DEAO2J9EGXYRJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY6/E9Z0/J9EGXYT1/FY6E9Z0J9EGXYT1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAD/52F4/J9EGXYUR/FAD52F4J9EGXYUR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0E/4ZKA/J9EGXYXC/F0E4ZKAJ9EGXYXC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F04/LKDS/J9EGXYYF/F04LKDSJ9EGXYYF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIL/3SYX/J9EGXYZY/FIL3SYXJ9EGXYZY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F17/DZ5A/J9EGXZ1N/F17DZ5AJ9EGXZ1N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLX/EXI3/J9EGXZ3D/FLXEXI3J9EGXZ3D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLM/2E7K/J9EGXZ5X/FLM2E7KJ9EGXZ5X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEM/TGEJ/J9EGXZ70/FEMTGEJJ9EGXZ70.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6S/F0RD/J9EGXZ9K/F6SF0RDJ9EGXZ9K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC4/BGDR/J9JFEKCB/FC4BGDRJ9JFEKCB.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 10: The Shell - Tiles and Edging"}, {"step": 11, "steps_text": "A design for strapping on the shell without using visible straps over the shoulders eluded me for quite some time ... until I found pictures of some high quality costumes used for promotional events, which integrated the sides as part of the shell. One of those head smacking realizations.I started by attaching some foam anchoring points to the base of the shell, as well as a nylon strap and plastic buckle, which would function as a belt and support the majority of the weight. A test run resulted in the nylon ripping away from the form, so I walled the strap in with more foam and added a second lamination to the anchor points [Fig. 2]. More of the flexible rolled mat was used for the sides and instead of making multiple iterations of a part, I decided to glue an oversized piece to the shell, strap it on, and mark a custom fit around my arm and leg [Fig. 3-4]. The two resulting cut outs were used to make a template and that template was then used to cut the opposing side, which I also let run long in the front [Fig. 3-6]. The sides were attached with Barge and then hot glue was liberally applied along the internal seams. After another fitting to determine the front overlap point of the two sides, there were cut to final length [Fig.8].The two sides connect in the front using four plastic buckles, which were attached with Barge on the faces and hot glue around all the edges. A length of nylon was left attached so that it could be adhere to the foam and provide strength (4\" of length, but trimmed as necessary).  My fear was that gluing the plastic alone wouldn't hold up ... I'd go to tighten the strap and they'd pop right off.Note: After cutting the nylon, I burned the ends to melt them and prevent fraying.  I used a torch, but any flame will do..Experience Tip: I glued the female side of the buckles to the foam first, then assembled the buckles and pinned the two sides together in order to get perfect alignment across the board [Fig. 10].Lengths of 2\" wide industrial velcro was applied between the nylon straps - notice both the hook and loop sides [Fig. 12].  The shell was once again strapped on, plastic removed to expose the Velcro's adhesive, chest plate obsessively aligned while floating in mid air ... then pressed against all six magic rectangles - another perfect alignment tip!  Removing the chest plate revealed that the velcro didn't have an ideal bond against the diamond plate pattern, so I reinforced each patch with hot glue.Reference photos show a more substantial edge along the top and bottom of the side panels, which I simulated by beveling a length of foam, cutting off a 3/4\" wide strips, then cutting/gluing them to fit along the top and bottom contours [Fig. 14-16].  The sanding drum was used to round over sharp edges, as well as add the depicted battle damage.  These edges were painted putty/light tan, while the field of the panel was skinned using brown spandex - Super 77 held it in place well enough for all for edges to be secured with hot glue [Fig. 17-18].", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ0/DWKY/J9EGY177/FJ0DWKYJ9EGY177.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1I/FRED/J9EGY183/F1IFREDJ9EGY183.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVB/MF6B/J9EGY195/FVBMF6BJ9EGY195.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYI/5W5H/J9EGY1AL/FYI5W5HJ9EGY1AL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ2/ZDVW/J9EGY1AM/FQ2ZDVWJ9EGY1AM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCS/9QN1/J9EGY1E1/FCS9QN1J9EGY1E1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5T/A4FJ/J9EGY1GR/F5TA4FJJ9EGY1GR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM6/OWG7/J9EGY1IN/FM6OWG7J9EGY1IN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F05/VTRX/J9EGY1JY/F05VTRXJ9EGY1JY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSQ/CPFC/J9EGY1LO/FSQCPFCJ9EGY1LO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGJ/IVRN/J9EGY1P4/FGJIVRNJ9EGY1P4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOW/XSUN/J9EGY1RN/FOWXSUNJ9EGY1RN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2S/QXHD/J9EGY1UK/F2SQXHDJ9EGY1UK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYJ/QX8P/J9EGY1W6/FYJQX8PJ9EGY1W6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSS/GO26/J9EGY1XS/FSSGO26J9EGY1XS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB9/H0BH/J9EGY101/FB9H0BHJ9EGY101.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF7/HNXN/J9EHEYQ9/FF7HNXNJ9EHEYQ9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1R/1SIZ/J9EHEYQ8/F1R1SIZJ9EHEYQ8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVY/2HAC/J9JFEKDZ/FVY2HACJ9JFEKDZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 11: The Shell - Sides and Strapping"}, {"step": 12, "steps_text": "I found several shell color variants.

Once that way dry, I dusted the entire surface with a darker tan.  What I mean by dusting is that instead of the average 6 - 10 inch distance, I widen the gap to 20 -24 inches.  The paint spreads out for partial coverage as opposed to full concealment.  After the first dusting, I wanted more depth, so I added more brown and black to the edges and a blop of putty in the center of each tile.

I figured it would be relatively easy to do with 4 way stretch material and would be a huge time saver since I wouldn't need to wait for paint to dry. I'm sure it was partially due to the learning curve, but I'm certain paint would've been faster.  I don't really have any shortcuts or templates for this step, as I was just making it up as I went.Feet: I started at the top of the foot.  A little Super 77 held the fabric in place while I tacked the top edge with hot glue.  Next, I pulled out the wrinkles, laid down a bead of hot glue in each toe slot, and pressed in the fabric with a putty knife.  The remaining spandex was then wrapped around the sides and tacked in place with hot glue [Fig. 1-5].Experience Tip: Hot glue works very well for securing spandex if you use a small amount - too much and it will look and feel bumpy.  Also, be careful not to accidentally touch your work with the tip of the gun or you will leave a discolored spot.Experience Tip 2: Lay the fabric over the glue and just tap one or twice lightly.  If you hold it an apply pressure, the glue will soak through and discolor the fabric.Legs: Super 77 held the fabric in place on the front of the leg while I tacked down the bottom edge.  I then worked by my way around the sides using hot glue to secure any edge to the foam.  For the back seam, I overlapped the fabric and used Killer Red Tape in order to avoid a noticeable line of hot glue [Fig. 5-7].Note: Any gaps or unsightly seams around the ankle will be covered by brown spandex.Head: I split the head into two hemispheres with the demarcation placed under the mask.  I started with the bottom half - specifically the mouth. Once I had the fabric wrapped and tacked into the mouth, I worked my way around each side and used Killer Red Tape on the back seam. Instead of Super 77, I used pins to temporarily hold the fabric as I worked out wrinkles and tacked down the edges under the mask and inside of the neck.  For the crown portion of the head, I started in the front with the eyes, then the back of the head, and finished by pulling wrinkles out towards the demarcation.  I overlapped this horizontal seam and while it's not the prettiest, it'll be covered by the mask [Fig. 8-12].Experience Tip: Strategically pin in portions of fabric which will either be removed or concealed - the pins occasionally leave visible holes ... especially if you are stretching the fabric to remove wrinkles.Arms: The arms were a breeze. I tacked one edge and then wrapped the fabric around at an upward angle in order to form a palm.  I chose the inside face of the arm as the overlap point and used Killer Red Tape.  At this point, I thought I had the technique down and would be done in no time ... nope. The fingers were a nightmare [Fig. 13-16].Fingers: These were a nightmare.  I used one piece of fabric to wrap what is basically the back of the hand, one for the each finger, and one for the thumb.  I don't even have a clear way to explain the process other than I would glue one edge and then wrap the spandex around the digit - pulling wrinkles, tucking, folding, and tacking as I went [Fig. 17-20].Experience Tip: Strategically keep all of your seams in location which will be covered by the wrist wrap, as well as the finger wrap.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FK7/XIIZ/J9EGXT55/FK7XIIZJ9EGXT55.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSI/1U12/J9EGXT57/FSI1U12J9EGXT57.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMU/AMBC/J9EGXT74/FMUAMBCJ9EGXT74.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFQ/HQ7Y/J9EGXT8Y/FFQHQ7YJ9EGXT8Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRA/8C4T/J9EGXTBA/FRA8C4TJ9EGXTBA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPR/0PNC/J9EGXTCC/FPR0PNCJ9EGXTCC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA5/FZGU/J9EGXTE6/FA5FZGUJ9EGXTE6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYF/23XG/J9EGXTG8/FYF23XGJ9EGXTG8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F52/283X/J9EGXTH4/F52283XJ9EGXTH4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF1/28B9/J9EGXTHL/FF128B9J9EGXTHL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLZ/76I9/J9EGXTJI/FLZ76I9J9EGXTJI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZH/CR4X/J9EGXTLS/FZHCR4XJ9EGXTLS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFK/OMXO/J9EGXTMR/FFKOMXOJ9EGXTMR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZQ/FZ6P/J9EGXTMT/FZQFZ6PJ9EGXTMT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIY/AC9B/J9EGXTOP/FIYAC9BJ9EGXTOP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6N/BFN9/J9EGXTQZ/F6NBFN9J9EGXTQZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1C/DO3H/J9EGXTSD/F1CDO3HJ9EGXTSD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F36/4FCJ/J9EGXTUC/F364FCJJ9EGXTUC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI6/6PJP/J9EGXTVB/FI66PJPJ9EGXTVB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN3/N55R/J9EGXTWB/FN3N55RJ9EGXTWB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX1/57UN/J9IRF3OR/FX157UNJ9IRF3OR.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 13: Spandex Skinning"}, {"step": 14, "steps_text": "For the ankle and wrist wrapping, I used 2\" wide strips of brown spandex, which was cut using a metal straight edge and the roller cutter. The wrapping is pretty simple, but I overthink everything and took my time because I wanted the sides to by as symmetrical as possible.The starting edge of the strip was tacked in place with hot glue and then the spandex was wrapped around the ankle - sometimes over the toe ... sometimes behind the leg ... until all of the necessary green and unsightly seams were buried forever. Each time I ran out of length, I would just tack the next strip onto the last.  This helped give the look of one continuous wrap, which I found to be more realistic [Fig. 3-6].Note: Tack the fabric down as much as possible because it will move. I learned this lesson after the first night of wear when the spandex shifted around.The wrists are exponentially easier than the ankles because it's a solitary loop. Add more glue tacks than you think you'll need, because it will also move around.For the finger and palm wrap, I used 1\" wide strips cut from a white cotton T-shirt. I tacked the starting edge with glue, ran around the digit/palm twice, cut the end to terminate in a low visibility area, and glued down the end [Fig. 7-8].

I found cutting the bevels on a longer length of foam and then cross cutting that into the required length for the pads gave the best results, because it reduced the opportunity for variations in the angle [Fig. 1-2].  I left the single bevel strips wider than necessary, so I could trim them to fit once I had the dual bevel sections dry fit.My glue up strategy was to start with the top and bottom sections, using  a block of plywood to keep the layers parallel [Fig. 4-5].  That approach made aligning the center section pretty much fool proof.  These two layers were then glued to atop a third, which was identical to the middle - one piece at full dimensions.Note: I let the lengths of the beveled sections run a bit long so I wouldn't have to worry about side to side alignment.  It was easy to trim off afterwards.All of the pads were wrapped with brown spandex.  A light coat of Super 77 was applied to the foam to keep the spandex from sliding around too much. A bead of hot glue was extruded into the bottom of one groove and a wide putty knife used to press the spandex into said groove ... maintaining pressure while the glue set.  This process was repeated for the second groove.  The spandex was then wrapped around the sides, wrinkles pulled out, and secured on the backside with hot glue [Fig. 6-7].Each pad needed a strap, so I flailed through some sewing to make rings using more brown spandex.  I was surprised by how difficult it was to sew spandex, but I don't have a serger, nor do I have any fancy sewing machine feet with built in rollers.  Pinning didn't dissuade the fabric's desire to perpetually bunch, but my old pal masking tape helped reacquire the advantage!  Tape on one side resulted in minimal bunching ... tape on both sides had around 1% bunching [Fig. 10].  I know this isn't \"proper sewing technique,\" but who am I to argue with results ... especially when time is running out?  Once I had the long sides sewn, I added more tape, folded spandex over on itself right side out, and closed the loop with some subpar zig zag stitching [Fig. 11-12].Note: Right side out makes it possible to hide the ugly seem when the rings are glued to the pads.The spandex straps were secured to the back of the pads using hot glue.  A bead of glue down the vertical center and press the ugly seam right into it [Fig. 15].  A second bead for the other side of the seam and roll the fabric into the molten stream.  The look is finished by gluing the rings to all four edges of the pad, which also conceals any unfortunate seams.The reference photos show small rectangular patches on the pads (two on each side), which I assume would be for reinforcement. I didn't really need the strength, but I wanted to stay true to the look, so I cut 3/4\" x 1 1/2\" rectangles out of 1/8\" foam.  These were spray painted with a base coat of putty and then dusted with dark brown and a bit of black.  They were secured to the spandex with hot glue [Fig. 16-19].Each pad is attached to it's respective limb using a medium sized patch of Velcro [Fig. 20].Foam DimensionsElbow Pads: 7 1/2\" width x 6\" height Knee Pads: 5\" width x 5 1/2\" heightFabric Ring DimensionsElbow Pads: 5 1/2\" x 15\"\"Knee Pads: 6 1/2\" x 22\"", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FGE/Y5H7/J9EGXUXX/FGEY5H7J9EGXUXX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA6/NYU5/J9EGXUXC/FA6NYU5J9EGXUXC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7N/CFCR/J9EGXUXN/F7NCFCRJ9EGXUXN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD2/TSS0/J9EGXUZ3/FD2TSS0J9EGXUZ3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4U/6FX3/J9EGXV06/F4U6FX3J9EGXV06.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR8/70WU/J9EGXV5P/FR870WUJ9EGXV5P.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGU/BXBB/J9EGXV0Y/FGUBXBBJ9EGXV0Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1K/C1E8/J9EGXV4N/F1KC1E8J9EGXV4N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0D/CMOI/J9EGXV77/F0DCMOIJ9EGXV77.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4V/O76A/J9EGXVA5/F4VO76AJ9EGXVA5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1Z/YQ2W/J9EGXVCF/F1ZYQ2WJ9EGXVCF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTO/Z267/J9EGXVCH/FTOZ267J9EGXVCH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4Y/D3OM/J9EGXVDS/F4YD3OMJ9EGXVDS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV7/ZVR2/J9EGXVEU/FV7ZVR2J9EGXVEU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXA/I0S2/J9EGXVGL/FXAI0S2J9EGXVGL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY4/8CVN/J9EHEYHB/FY48CVNJ9EHEYHB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKV/XUXC/J9EHEYGF/FKVXUXCJ9EHEYGF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLQ/ABGR/J9EHEYGG/FLQABGRJ9EHEYGG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6F/DQHZ/J9EHEYGV/F6FDQHZJ9EHEYGV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWG/X58P/J9EGXVHJ/FWGX58PJ9EGXVHJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDY/XE5N/J9JFEKE8/FDYXE5NJ9JFEKE8.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 15: Elbow and Knee Pads"}, {"step": 16, "steps_text": "The belt is made using brown vinyl wrapped around a 1/8\" foam core to give it more heft.  The foam strip was cut to a width of 4\", while the vinyl was cut to 8 1/4\" - this provides enough material for wrapping around the sides. The foam was adhered to the middle of the vinyl so that once wrapped around to the back, the horizontal seam would fall in the middle [Fig. 3-5].Note: The backing material of vinyl soaks up a lot of Barge, so be prepared.Note 2: I purchased one yard of vinyl, so I was forced to have a vertical seam/splice point. If you don't want the seam, get two yards.  My final belt length ended up being 68 1/2\".Note 3: You'll notice I staggered the splice point of the foam vs. the vinyl.Each turtle has a different style of belt - Michelangelo's has built-in holders for his nunchaku. Fabrication of these holders started with an EVA and packing foam core. Foam rectangles were cut to the dimensions of 2\" x 4\" (four out of EVA and two out of the packing foam). Marking 1\" in from each edge will give you the center point for the required holes. A section 1 1/4\" galvanized pipe was used to punch the holes in the EVA, while 3/4 copper pipe was used to punch the packing foam - the edges of the pipes were sharpened using the oscillating belt sander. The foam was glued into inedible sandwiches, radial slits cut in the softer foam so the nanchaku could fit, and EVA blocks added to the ends to keep the blocks from distorting/squishing [Fig. 7-9].While gluing up the belt, I also made two smaller sections for the nunchaku holders - 3 1/4\" wide foam with 3 1/2\" wide vinyl. The foam cores were glued to the center of the vinyl sections, which was then wrapped around the two shorted sides [Fig. 11].  It was at this point that I learned of vinyl's superpower - its impervious to almost every adhesive in existence. The contact cement was partially holding, but the parts separated easily, so I added hot glue, which didn't do much better. I decided to test adhesives on some scrap (results below) and ultimately decided on a combination of VHB tape (Killer Red Tape) and metal rivets.The holders were pressed down against the work table so that the side flanges could be trimmed down to 1 1/4\" [Fig. 12]. A 5/8\" marking gauge was used to pinpoint rivet location and a leather punch was used to make the holes [Fig. 13-15].  The holders were then used to transfer hole locations to the belt with an awl and then punched [Fig 16-17].  Killer Red adhered the foam core to the vinyl and rivets were used for the vinyl to vinyl connections [Fig. 18-20].  These pouches will hold the nanchaku and though Killer Red is strong, I'm not confident in its ability to support the weight and sheer force long term.Note: I intentionally placed the first pouch over the vertical seam in the belt.Note 2: After attaching the first pouch, I laid the belt across the back of the shell in order to make the location of the second pouch - no measuring ... no guess work [Fig. 21-22].Reference photos show small rectangular patches on the pouch flanges, so I used this detail to conceal the rivets.  They are nothing more than 1/2\" x 1\" vinyl rectangles stuck onto Killer Red and then placed on the belt like high bond stickers [Fig. 23-25].  Larger patches (3/4\" x 1 7/8\") were  placed on the belt in accordance with reference photos and industrial velcro was added to each end.Note: The edges of the vinyl patches were white - a wash of diluted black paint was brushed on and wiped off to make everything blend.  I also took the opportunity to paint the visible faces of the foam cores black.The belt attaches to the shell in three locations, as well as the front chest plate location - those can be scene in The Shell - Painting step of this Instructable.The nunchaku were made using 3/4\" PVC pipe and couplers, 1/2\" PVC sheeting, eyebolts, fender washers, lock nuts, and plastic chain - finished with spray paint and wrapped in vinyl.

We really liked the LEDs since they are unique and make the kids easy to see when they are running around at night.  We decided to do something that lights up again, but weren't sure what. It was my daughter that suggested Pac-Man, since she had recently played the Namco gem at a bowling alley a few weeks prior. That suggestion was all we would need. It was a great idea and we had to make it happen.Note: Please excuse the lack of great process photos.I hadn't initially planned on doing a write up while I was making this.

Choose the CharactersWe chose Pac-Man characters for the family. Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, and the ghosts Blinky and Pinky. I wanted it to be accurate and authentic to the original 8-bit characters so I began by looking up the original game sprites.These help ensure we are getting the correct pixel pixel layout and shows each frame of the animations. For instance you can see the different frames of the ghost legs and Pac-Man's mouth in the sprites above. I then laid out each frame of the animations in Excel so we know where the number of LEDs and the overall layout of each board. The individual numbers of the LEDs are needed later for programming the Ardunio board.Number of LEDsThe Ghosts cover 170 pixels, Pac-Man is 137, and Ms. Pac-Man is 151, which means we needed 628 LEDs for the pixels. (170+170+137+151) Size of PanelsYou can see by the layout in Excel that the Ghosts are 14 pixels in height by 14 pixels in width. Pac-Man is 13x13 and Ms.Pac-Man is 14x14.Once we knew the width and height by pixels we have to decide how big we wanted to make the panels.  I wanted them all to be the same size relative to one another, so each pixel would be the same size on each costume. The strings of LEDs we purchased had a distance of about 3\" (75mm) between LEDs. This gives us the high end of how big we can make each pixel. To scale them properly we started by making sure it would be the right size for the smallest family member, my son. I measure him and held up some cardboard cutouts to see what was the largest size he could still comfortably put his arms over and still walk. We ended up at 22\" as the size of the ghosts in height and width, but you may want to do a different size. That set our scale of our pixels at 1.57\" square (22\" / 14 pixels, for the Ghost).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F77/MWCR/J9JFW1Z8/F77MWCRJ9JFW1Z8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFR/S5P5/J9JFW1LJ/FFRS5P5J9JFW1LJ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Planning"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "We wanted the costumes to be relatively easily to wear and not too terribly cumbersome, so we opted for light materials rather than durable ones.

You can either send it out to be cut by a company that does laser cutting, or you can go the manual route and print the PDF and lay it out on the cardboard and cut it by hand.The base is made from 1/8\" cardboard sheets purchased from the local art/hobby store. Our laser cutter has a 32\"x18\" bed so I had them cut the sheets down to that size. PanelThe panel is made up of a few main parts: the base, the slats, the cover, and the strap. The base holds the LEDs, the slate provide the pixels and overall stability of the panel, the cover diffuses the light, and the strap makes it portable. ModelingTo make the files for the laser cutter I modeled the base using Rhino. I modeled the all the parts of the panel very accurately in an effort to let the laser cutter do as much work as possible. I made each panel so that each vertical and horizontal fin would slide into each other and they would notch also into the base. Setting it up this way allows the parts of the panel to slide and notch together without the need for much glue, while also ensuring we would get perfect squares for the pixels. Notes:  The notches and joints have a 1/64\" clearance on both sides to let the cardboard slide together nicely. The slots end up being 5/32\" wide (1/8\" + 1/64\" + 1/64\").I have added the 3d model in DWG format to the files for those interested.Laser CuttingAs mentioned before our laser cutter is 32\"x18\" so the CAD files I made to do the laser cutting are set on that size. I have added the .dwg file for the Ghost costume. You can use it to laser cut your own, or you can print it out and use it as a template to hand cut the cardboard. If you are going to do it by hand you can easily lay this out and cut strips of cardboard. You can could measure it out yourself, the pixels are about 1.5\" square and 2\" deep with a 12mm hole in the middle for the LEDs. You can also use the provided PDF as a template for cutting. Notes: We used 12mm LEDs and that's what size the holes are. The LEDs went in nicely, but since it is cardboard they got a little loose, especially if I had to take the LEDs out and put them back in. If I were to redo it I would make those holes slightly smaller.AssemblyThe base had to be cut in two pieces since our laser cutter bed's small dimension is 18\", which is smaller than the 22\" x 22\" dimension of the base. I used good ole duct tape at the join to keep it together initially. This is really to keep it in place while adding the LEDs and slats. Once the slats were added to the base they provided the real support and stability. Each slat is labeled by scoring either \"H#\" or \"V#\" for Horizontal (H) and Vertical (V) and which number (#) in order. The slats slide together nicely since we added additional 1/32\" clearance. My first tests left a lot less room where they slid together and made it impossible to put it all together. Once the were all slid together we put the slats on the base. They notched in where the plus sign shaped holes in the base are. Once it was on the base I duct taped the slats to the base on the ends. Then I added a small bead of hot glue the top left corner where the slats meet to keep them in place and ensure they wouldn't slip.The notches for the slats extend through the base so there is a small tab on the back of the base. I also added a bead of hot glue to these tabs to keep the slats securely on the base. After thoughtAs you can see in the 3d model diagram I did not plan for an enclosure on the back of the panel. This was  a mistake! I noticed this a couple of hours before tick-or-treating and I hastily cut 2.5\" cardboard strips and added them to the back of the panel. to give something other than the LED wires to rest against the body. This helped, but really it should have been fully enclosed. When walking around with the panels with the back open the LEDs tend to get pushed in. You can see in some of the pictures where the pixels are no longer really pixels, but point lights. This is where the LEDs were pushed or fell in. I stopped the family a few times to fix these over the night or tick-or-treating. Note: If you are going to make these, plan for a back panel to enclose the LEDs. Don't make the same mistake.

In my case distance between the individual LEDs on the pre-strung bundle is about 3 inches (75mm). This meant the pixels had to be adjacent to one another when laying them out. For the starting point just make sure it is close to where you can mount the Arduino and power supply.Placing The LEDsFollowing the pattern laid out in Excel we push the LEDs from the back into place in the cardboard.Note: The layout is mirrored since the excel layout it looking from the front, and we are pushing them in from the back. The 0 LED is on the left in Excel and on the right in the picture of the base from the back.The LEDs have a small flange that keeps them in place.

Then use a USB to DC adapter to plug into your lights which should now be wired with the female DC adapter. I made a mistake and used a 8xAA Battery Pack with an On/Off switch that I had from the previous year's costumes. It was only while writing this did I realize it has a 12V output and I was using 5V LEDs. (I am no rocket surgeon but I think this is bad). Since I had the battery pack around I just picked it up and plugged it in and everything worked and I didn't second guess it  \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00afInterestingly enough the battery packs I used gave us only about 2 hours of on-time. After figuring out that they were the incorrect power supply for the panels I tested the panels with the correct 5VDC portable phone charger and they lasted much much longer. I tested a 2200 mAh and a 7800 mAh portable charger and the panels ran for 3h 40m and 12h 43m respectively. This means with a cheap \"lipstick charger\" you can get nearly 4 hours of on time. Note: The on-time I got from my test were with the ghost costumes (170 LEDs) running at 40 brightness out of 255 (The brightness is set in the code section)LEDsI used strings of 12mm WS2811 individually addressable LEDs for outdoor signage. I bought them on Amazon and they came in strings of 50. Since I needed over 600 I bought the 500 pack which came with a bit of a discount. WiringThe wiring of the power to the lights and then to the board is done as shown in the diagram and photo. The first LED on the string has a power-in connection. There are two wires (hot/red and ground/white). These are wired to a female power jack adapter. The power supply is plugged into this adapter. The 5V, GND, and DATA from that first LEDs 3pin JST connector/input port are connected to the 5V, GND, and 3 PIN connections on the Arduino board. Make sure you check your string of LEDs before wiring it up. My LED wires were Red(5V), Green (DATA), White(GND), but yours may be different.Notes:When using the USB to power the Arduino, unplug the 5V connection, but leave the GNDDo not mix up the 5v and GND - that can fry your board.

If you don't know how to do this there is a great  article on Arduino's Website: Getting Started with ArduinoFastLEDI used the FastLED library for these. Its easy to use and easy to find examples to help figure everything out. It was useful that they use Web Colors so you can set any LED to any color by using the name. My Code Below is the code for the Ghost, I have also uploaded the Arduino code file.   The  basic outline for the logic is to fill all LEDs with the main color,  then change the color of, and turn off the individual sets of LEDs to  make each \"frame\". Once we have a set for each \"frame\" of the animation,  we loop through them at X speed X number of times to make up the whole  animation. There may be a smarter way of doing this, but this is how I  did it and it worked for me. Notes:  You can turn the brightness up and down it will have an effect on how long the batteries last.

The foam is softer and can be squished without losing its original shape. Paint the piece black. Other colors may work, but the desired effect is to make the character look empty inside or filled with bugs. Since burlap wont let enough light through to show bugs, black worked best.

difference.\u00a0 I\u00a0wanted my iris to be concave to cause light to play on it like a real iris.\u00a0 Since I\u00a0chose to work with plastic, I decided to heat the plastic just enough to be

Shaping the Eye"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Painting is not as daunting as it seems.\u00a0 Talent and experience help but there are some basic techniques that will get reasonable results, and those results will improve with practice.\u00a0 If you have never painted before I\u00a0recommend practicing on a paper plate or the back (unslick) side of a piece of poster or bristol board first until you feel comfortable with it.\u00a0 The technique I\u00a0use is a method of brush loading which causes the paint to blend in ways which would otherwise be very difficult to achieve.\u00a0 \nWhen you have house paint mixed, it is very important to have it well mixed, in nature there are very few continuous colors.\u00a0 I usually mix a base color and then use dabs of other shades and load my brush with multiple colors at once to drag and swirl them to mimic nature.\u00a0 The simplest form of this is to load one side of your brush with one color and the other side with another.\u00a0 The action of applying the paint causes the colors to mix in the middle revealing a multitude of different shades which would take hours to blend otherwise.\u00a0 If you wet your brush before loading it you will intensify this effect.\u00a0 Using a relatively dry brush will give you a narrower band of blend.\u00a0 Using these methods it is important to thoroughly clean out your brush between each application as the paint from previous strokes will cause your colors to become muddy and dull.\n-To do my irises I\u00a0used a semi dry brush technique, to load my brush I\u00a0pressed the side of my brush into the wet paint, then pressed the other side of the brush into another shade or color.\u00a0 I\u00a0repeated this, building up layers of paint with similar effects.\n-Since the patterns in the eye radiate outward from the center, the pupil, I\u00a0made all brush strokes radiating out from the center in this manner.\n-in between each layer, I used my hair dryer on a warm medium setting to speed the drying of the paint.\n-using the brush I trimmed down, I pulled it through blobs of color adding detail.\n-I\u00a0then used my sand paper to sand down through the layers, revealing the swirls of color which\u00a0are similar to those seen in a real eye.\n-A tiny light dab of paint applied it interesting spots can provide a place for another addition of realism. \u00a0I dabbed a little paint here and there and then using the colored chalk and my knife I scraped off some chalk dust. \u00a0Once it had adhered to the paint I blew the excess away.", "step_imgs":

irises I\u00a0had painted, I\u00a0was still wanting a little more realism.\u00a0 After some serious brain racking I\u00a0figured out a way to get what I wanted.\u00a0 I've not seen this method used before so as far as I know I\u00a0came up with it. \u00a0I'm sharing/publishing my method here so that others who wish to make their own eyeball art can use it as well.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 After spending much time looking at extreme closeup pictures of eyes, I realized that one of the reasons fake or artificial eyes end up looking kinda flat is because real eyes aren't. \u00a0There are myriad little imperfections cords and striations that make up the iris.\nWhat to do:\n-take your unwaxed white dental floss and, using your scissors cut small pieces which are a tiny bit longer than the distance from the center of your iris indentation to the outside of your iris. \u00a0Its a good idea to cut way more than you think you'll need since you have to apply them while the paint is wet and spending the time cutting more may allow your paint to dry, causing you to have to apply another layer of paint and possibly messing up a decent looking color foundation.\n-Figure out what color you want your eyes to be and mix a base color that is slightly different than what you want. \u00a0I figured out that a fairly darker shade seems to work pretty well.\u00a0\n-Now mix a shade that is only slightly darker than what you want. \u00a0Mix more than you will need since you don't want to run out and end up needing to match a shade, its a pain.\n-Apply this shade liberally, especially in the little pupil well. \u00a0Leave a tiny bit of the darkest color showing through. \u00a0Add some around the outside of the pupil.\n-Now, I carefully placed the end of the unwaxed dental floss pieces into the edge of the pupil well and flexed the fibers outwards and using the end of the paint brush I sharpened and a wooden match stick I pressed the fibers into the wet paint at the outer rim. \u00a0I then spread the outside edge of the fibers leaving some irregularities and making pits through to the base color.\n-The floss is kind of shiny so I mixed a wash of white and another of a light shade of the color of the eye. \u00a0To make a wash you start with a small amount of paint and some water in a section of your paper plate or\u00a0palette, whatever you are using. \u00a0Basically its like making paint the consistency of \u00a0strong tea, hot chocolate or strong coffee. \u00a0Then I just lightly touched the end of my brush to the fibers in the iris. \u00a0Surface tension does the rest causing the fibers to loose their shine.\n-Now is a good time to use the trimmed down brush, the one with 8 or 10 bristles to add a few color highlights. \u00a0It will fit between strands of floss and can really add additional realism.\n-If you can find an 18 millimeter hole \"drill\" for foam board it will make the next portion easier, if not just use the exacto. \u00a0Carefully cut any fibers which extend past the edge of the iris avoiding fingers and avoiding making deep gouges in the plastic of the eye. \u00a0A foam board \"drill\" is just a piece of sharpened metal tube which will cut all of the fibers at once.\n-Once your paint is dry taking the 400 grit or higher sand paper sand the small stray brush strokes off the surface of the eye which should be white.\n-The last item in this step is the pupil. \u00a0You will want a paint or nail polish which dries to a matte or flat finish. \u00a0If you don't have this you will need to carefully scrape the surface of the pupil to remove the shine. \u00a0The pupil in a real eye is a hole and doesn't reflect light, therefore the pupil in our eye should come as close to this as possible.", "step_imgs":

iris, the whites of a set of eyes are important to providing realism. \u00a0First of all, the white of an eye isn't really completely white. \u00a0Depending on the person it may have a red tint from irritation, drugs or alcohol abuse, it might have a slightly bluish tinge from certain hormone levels or enzymes present in the body, it might be yellow from decreased liver function and excessive bilirubin as in IV drug users with liver disease, or they may have a brownish tinge with green and gray spots if they are a zombie. \u00a0In most cases the whites of eyes will also have at least some blood vessels present.\n-Carefully and quickly put on a base coat of white acrylic paint. \u00a0Thinner paint will run together hiding brush strokes but will require more coats. \u00a0Thicker paint will have better coverage but may end up not giving a smooth finish. \u00a0For the base coat a consistency about equal to 2% milk is pretty good. \u00a0Be careful not to get it on the iris as it will wick up into your iris and possibly mess up a lot of work and make you say words that will get put on your permanent record.\n-Using the hair dryer to speed drying will make this go quicker. \u00a0The seam in my bolo hair bows were a pain. \u00a0They kept wicking up the paint. \u00a0I finally applied undiluted paint to the seam and then sanded it smooth filling in the crack. \u00a0Once this was done I continued to apply several coats of white acrylic paint. \u00a0\n[edit] Discovered a better way to get the whites looking even more realistic and it makes them even easier to achieve good results.\n-Once the white acrylic base is dry, lightly sand any brush strokes. \u00a0You don't need to be too fanatical about it though. \u00a0\nI bought a bottle of white nail polish, real high dollar stuff it was $3.98. \u00a0It has high solids and dries very quickly. \u00a0Having high solids it covers a multitude of sins (and brush strokes and lines and oops etc...)\n-Cut short sections of red yarn, about 3 inches or around 8 centimeters, its not critical. \u00a0Then pull the sections of yarn apart. \u00a0Now start picking these apart until you have 15 or so strands separated.\n-Apply the white nail polish liberally from iris to the bottom of the eye, working your way round the eye as you go.\n-By the time I get all the way round the eye the polish I applied is already starting to set. \u00a0A little extra and some careful blending gives a surface that is beautifully smooth.\n-Now working quickly I embed the strands into the wet nail polish, then using care and trying to make it look like webs of blood vessels I placed it against the wet polish. \u00a0I helped the strands into place using the pointed end of my sharpened paint brush. \u00a0bringing the strands together like the branching of a tree when possible.\n-A little blood red nail polish applied to the lower parts of the \"tree\" shapes helps with realism and depth.\n-Now using a disposable container I mix a few drops of white, a few drops of the semi-transparent opalescent yellowish color and a fair amount of clear. \u00a0My goal was to cause the \"blood\u00a0vessels\" appear to be just visible in the surface of the white of the eye when they are small and the larger\u00a0capillaries to be more visible. \u00a0\n-I allowed this to dry, then successive\u00a0coats of clear polish help to\u00a0embed\u00a0the fibers into the surface of the white of the eye.\n*(a special not here, I tried using an enamel meant for model cars in one of the trial and error sessions which didn't work out, it didn't work well at all, the clear acrylic nail polish and following top coat caused the enamel to get a crackle finish which looked like...

Black and White photography is not simply a result of old technology of a bygone era. Black and white is a technique that we can still employ today to enhance our photography. With black and white photography, we are allowed to see the world beyond colors. With black and white photography, we can control moods. With black and white photography, we can highlight details we normally would not see in color. Ultimately, with black and white photography, it is a technique that can enhance our ability to tell our story through imagery. However, unlike color photography, many of us have trouble creating artistic or compelling black and white photos. Thus, this will be a beginner's guide to black and white photography. In this Instructables, we will learn to think in black and white, learn how to set up our camera, look at some examples of how we can use black and white photography to enhance our craft and lastly, we will look at some post processing tips. Techniques and opinions in this guide should not be taken as hard rules for black and white photography or photography in general. There are no absolute rules in photography, only suggestions. Experiment and see what works for you. Discover your own style.Requirements: \t\tPoint and shoot digital camera or DSLR \t\tA basic understanding of photography principle \t\tA computer \t\tPost processing software (Photoshop, Lightroom, Aperture, Gimp, iPhoto, etc) \t\tand most important curiosity to learn", "title": "The Art of Black and White Digital Photography", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/The-Art-of-Black-and-White-Digital-Photography/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Before we start taking photos of things we think will look good in black and white, we need to be able to think in black and white. How do we do this? The following are a few areas to think about before you should click your shutter button.Light Learn how light works. Photography is the art of capturing light. Without light, there would be no photography. The basic light principles have been the same since the first cameras came about. A medium, either film or a sensor captures light changed over time. Seeing how light is hitting the subject wil affect contrast. Brighter environments then to provide lighter tones of gray to white, and the opposite is true, less light appears darker or black in black and white photography. Remember you can control light with your shutter, aperture, and ISOColor Black and white photos are not just black and white, there are many shades or tones of gray. Thus, when thinking about black and white compositions, remember that colors will be implied and exist. Colors could be used to your advantage. Color tones could be altered when converting to black and white. With the example image, the green moss is not present in the photo due to it being a dark shade of green. so the green blends in to the rocks. If the photo was colored, the rocks would not be as striking as the green moss will become more of a distraction.Contrast In black and white photography, there are no colors. Everything is presented as white, tones of gray and black. Try to see the world or find subjects with in terms of contrast. Contrast is defined as the difference between the tones. Photos with high contrast means there is a lot of white and blacks, but very little shades of gray. Low contrast photos appear mostly black or white with some grey. Most photos are just normal contrast with a mix of black, white and grey tones. How do we see this contrast played out in the color worked? Many photographers prefer high contrast black and white photos as they create a stronger subject. However, lower contrast photos can also be useful in softening the subject. The photo example is a high contrast photo. High contrast photos tend to provide very striking outlines of the subject. The black rocks are being outlined by the white mist of the water. Composition wise, the black rocks in the mist creates an atmosphere of mystery.Simplicity My opinion is less is more with the photo composition. Try not to clutter the photo with too many details. A single strong subject is easier on the eyes when creating a message or story. This is more true for black and white. A beautiful and vivid landscape will be various shades of gray in black and white and may be more confusing in black and white.Post Processing Have an idea on how you plan to process the photo since what you see when you take the photo, might not represent what you want as your final result. Have these things in mind and composing a better black and white photo will be easier. These are not all the things to consider about black and white composition, but its a start to get you thinking in black and white. Remember to practice and figure out what works for you.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FRW/DP4Z/GTW60BPV/FRWDP4ZGTW60BPV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Thinking in Black and White"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Take Color Photos Do not be tempted to just set your camera to black and white in the settings. Take the photos in color. Why? First, this will allow you more practice to visualize your composition in black and white without the aid of what your camera telling you how a monochromatic photo \"should\" look like. Second, by taking the photo in color, you preserve all the color tones, white balance and exposure. This will allow greater range of post process editing compared to editing an already black and white photo that came off that camera. When you take a photo in black and white, all the color tones will be discarded leaving less information for the post processing software to use. If you do not intend in editing your photos, then you can shoot in black and white.Shoot in Raw If your camera supports Raw format, use that format instead of the jpeg format. Just as shooting in color, raw format preserves more of the photo's information. Raw format is essentially the raw data collected from the camera's sensor with all of the camera's settings. This will allow a greater range in post processing. Jpegs are compressed photos, so many of the image's information will be lost during jpeg processing done by the camera. There are plenty of websites out there that shows how many stops of light or amount of color tones are lost during jpg compression compared to the raw format. All dslrs and some high end point and shoot cameras will allow this format. The downside to shooting Raw is that not all photo editing software supports raw formats. The image example was shot in raw and was a tad underexposed due to the window. Because raw formats preserve more sensor information, I can fix the exposure in Lightroom with the recovery slider. With this correction ability from Raw, we can see the contrast between the bright window and the dark stairs. Now that we have an idea of how black and white photography works, what are some things we can do in black and white photography? Read on to find out.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FAK/BSL3/GTW60BPS/FAKBSL3GTW60BPS.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Setting Up the Camera"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Low key and high key are two popular techniques people use in black and white photography.Low key photos are mainly black or of darker shades of gray. The small bits of white in low key photos draw the viewer towards the subject. In this example, the harsh light hits the wall, and the light reflection reveal to us the contours of our subject. This is an easy way to create interesting photos at night without the need to run high ISOs or slow shutter speeds.High key is the exact opposite of low key. High key photos are predominantly white or lighter shades of gray. The darker areas draw the viewer to the subject for high key photos. High key in the example can be used for abstract art as a predominately white photo can be devoid of details. The focus can be on the abstract lines or patterns that are darker.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWW/0XCN/GTW65SRV/FWW0XCNGTW65SRV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2J/9250/GTXK84CP/F2J9250GTXK84CP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Using B&W to Create Low Key and High Key Effects"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Black and white photography at times can reduce elements that are distracting in our composition by controlling the light and colors. Black and white can also hide noise problems due to high ISO usage. Here are a few examples of what I mean. The first photo is a night of San Francisco from Pier 7. If you do a search of pier 7 on google, you will find a lot of photos showing the skyline and the pier. Some of these photos may appear cluttered especially at night with all the colors and light from the building. However, I wanted to take a photo that showed more of the pier. By underexposing and converting to black and white, the distant skyline fades into the background, but the light from the foreground lights up the details of the pier. You can see the planks on the pier and the slabs of wood used on the benches. The without the skyline as a distraction, we can easily see the leading lines created by the lights. In the second photo example, this is a photo of San Francisco from Sausalito. The clouds are moving in as if rain is coming. For this photo, i wanted the clouds to be the center of attention. By converting to black and white, we can really see the clouds pop out. Normally, when we observe a scene where it is about to rain, we see the colors of the water, the colors of the buildings, bits of blue sky peaking through the clouds. When we remove the colors and convert to black and white, we see contrast. The strong contrast between the rain clouds, white clouds and the sun cutting through the sky creates a situation of high contrast. The high contrast gives the clouds that stunning pop in black and white. For the third photo, we can use black and white to hide color noise. The photo was shot at ISO 1600. So there was some noise. By converting it to black and white, the color noise becomes a fine grain reminiscent of film. This can be a great way to create elegant low light photos while giving it a film feel.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FIV/0QX1/GTW60BPX/FIV0QX1GTW60BPX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F66/QJX1/GTQVPAW7/F66QJX1GTQVPAW7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0K/ICPW/GTXK851O/F0KICPWGTXK851O.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Using B&W to Reduce Distractions"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "While we saw that black and white photography can be used to reduce distractions, we can also use black and white photography to increase emphasis towards the subject. This is particularly useful with high contrast. The dark shadow of the coffee cup against the brightly lit chair allows us to focus on the cup even though the cup is off to the side of the photo. In the second photo, the great contrast between the white cat fur, the black eyes and the black background draws the viewer towards the cat's eyes and face. In this photo, a side light is coming in from the left side of the photo lighting the cat's white fur while the rest of the subject and background was dark. FYI, the cat was hiding behind a desk in the dark. This is somewhat a low key photo as well.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZM/KE72/GTQVPAW6/FZMKE72GTQVPAW6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FST/2LZE/GTW2B6ZJ/FST2LZEGTW2B6ZJ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Using B&W to Emphasize Subject"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Photography\u00a0is not\u00a0exclusively\u00a0used to present the\u00a0obvious. \u00a0Using black and white effectively, we can add some mystery to our photos. In our first photo example, I took this photo in a San Francisco park. \u00a0As the darker trees fade into the white fog, the changing shades of gray into pure white adds a sense of mystery to the photo. Whats beyond the fog? is a cliff or is it more trees? If this photo was in color, we might be more focus on the trail and the colors of the trees and not notice the encroaching mysterious fog. \u00a0To enhance this photo some more, i reduced the exposure. \u00a0If we took the photo in color with a reduced exposure by a stop or two, we might have color detail lost in the dark areas. \u00a0This can be hidden in black and white photos and be used to our advantage. In our second example, using a low key effect, we add mystery to the car. The glow of the headlights draws our eyes in and the ambient lighting outlines the car's body, yet it is dark and we wonder what the car is up to. The low key look with the glow of the headlights gives the car a menacing feel. We are not sure whats going on, but we are curious about the car. \u00a0Additional vignetting was adding in during post processing to help create more focus and mystery.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FE9/3RE0/GTW60BPT/FE93RE0GTW60BPT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9W/FWK4/GTW60BPP/F9WFWK4GTW60BPP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Using B&W to Create Mystery"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "With only black and white contrasts, we can reveal the details, textures and patterns that was lost in color. We see the first example photo is of the beach. Specifically, ripples of sand. While walking around, we will normally notice these ripples, but in color, these ripples do not stand out as much. What we see in color are shades of yellow from the sand. In black and white, the darker gray shades stand out a lot more than color. This contrast can be further enhance with post processing. We see from the photo, the ripples are very prominently displayed. We see here, the patterns, details and the textures of the sand was brought out with black and white processing. In the second photo, we see tentacles. The high contrast of the suction cups reveal to us the roundness of the cup. When devoid of colors, we do not notice the rest of the tentacle but only the cups. The rest of the tentcle fades into the gray and black. In the third photo, by controlling the lighting, we can see the textures on the face. The light helps use create areas of high contrast where details are revealed.

The example photo was taken from Lightroom, similar controls could be found in other post processing software. We will go through each setting and what you can do with it to improve your black and white photos. The Lightroom settings you see correspond to the night photo of the Palace of Fine Arts. The photo was taken in Raw format with a Canon Powershot s95 point and shoot.Histogram The histogram shows the distribution of tones. The left side is black, and the right side is white, the middle is gray. In the example, most of the photo is of darker shades. You can use this tool to monitor your distribution when you start editing.Treatment The treatment is the type of photo you are editing, either in color or black and white. I prefer changing the treatment to black and white. You also create a black and white by desaturating, but thats not truly black and white as the color information is not being discarded. Some programs call this feature \"gray scale\".White Balance While the photo is black and white, adjusting the white balance will still affect the photo. As with color photos, adjusting the white balance will alter the tones of gray. You can play with this to adjust your gray shades or tones if you like. I did not adjust WB in my example.Exposure Similar to color photos, adjusting exposure alters the lighting in the black and white photo. Exposure has a lot of ability to alter the contrast of a photo. Using the exposure can easily allow you to enhance low key or high key photos. I liked the overall exposure so I did not adjust the exposure in my example.Recovery Recovery allows you to bring back highlight detail. This can be great if your camera over exposed something you didnt want to over expose. This works even more effectively in black and white in my opinion than in color. Recovery at times in color seems understated, but in black and white, you can see the details come back right away. Since this was a night photo, and I wanted to display some of the details of the Place of Fine Arts, I adjusted the recovery to bring back some details due to the bright lights.Fill light and Blacks These two sliders can help you add more light or blacks to your photo. Both of these can greatly increase or degrease the contrast of the photo. As you can see, I adjusted both the blacks and fill light to increase contrast.Brightness You can play with this to brighten up your photo. I do not usually move this slider too much in black and white as the photos can easily wash out.Contrast This slider is self explanatory, increase contrast on the slider will increase contrast in photo. I increased the contrast to the maximum to really allow me to show the details of my subject.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FUR/7RZT/GTXK84V8/FUR7RZTGTXK84V8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4M/TWJ9/GTXKDD48/F4MTWJ9GTXKDD48.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Basic Post Processing"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "In conclusion, we see that light, colors and contrast play a large role in how our black and white photos work.

The pinhole glasses are not such a medical wonder, they were presented as, but maybe you can relax your eyes, wearing them for ten to fifteen minutes. At least it is an interesting experiment.Please be sure to wear your pinhole spectacles only for training and not while doing dangerous things like driving a car, where you can hurt yourself or others.

It will then send an alert via text message to a relative, care taker or nurse  at the front desk of a hospital. It gives the user enough time to cancel  the alert in case it was mistakenly triggered. The wearable was  designed thinking on elderly patients that might fall and injure  themselves needing assistance right away. While alert buttons and apps  are a good solution it requires the individual to report the fall which  might not be possible in cases where the person is left unconscious or  is unable to trigger the device. We later added two other possible modes  in case the device wanted to be used on babies or individuals suffering  of seizures such as epileptic patients. Smart Companion welcomes the user  by lighting up all LEDs and emitting a welcome setting sound. One can  chose any of the three settings (elderly, baby or health condition) by  clicking on one of the four button\u2019s on the board. A light will  illuminate to indicate which setting was picked and a text message will  be sent notifying that the device is now set for such setting. When the  individual falls the accelerometer data will trigger all LEDs to be  turned on red in the wearable and send an alert to the specified device.  Other methods of alerts can be set such as sending an e-mail, a pager,  etc. By setting up an  Azure free account data was posted to the cloud, all servers were configured which included the namespace servers, the storage and aggregators which would  then capture and analyze the data.", "title": "Smart Companion Fall Alert: a Health Monitor Our Elderly", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Smart-companion-fall-alert-a-health-monitor-our-el/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "For this project you will need:Hardware1) USB cable 2) Particle Internet Button or similar LED ring with accelerometer3) PhotonSoftware:1) An account at Particle.io  https://build.particle.io2) An account at IFTT http://ifttt.com/3) An account with Azure if you wish to upload information to the cloud for later use ", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FAS/2UKW/IHCBUKBU/FAS2UKWIHCBUKBU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQP/BV5Q/IHCBUKBT/FQPBV5QIHCBUKBT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAT/60YY/IHCBV33I/FAT60YYIHCBV33I.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: List of Materials"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The Photon will be the part that will make your Internet Button or any other LED ring shield with acceleremoter connected to the Internet to be able to upload information to the cloud or connect it to other devices if needed.

If your storage and namespace are in different locations you will be charged for cross colo data transportation. 3) If you are using Windows you can also set up a dashboard/website following the steps at https://github.com/BretStateham/connectthedots/blo... after you do the prep work. 4) Once you have your namsepace, storage and other boxes set up in Azure you will need to create a webhook.json. In your machine create webhook.json, since I am used to using console I followed these steps while on a console/terminal window.$ vi webhook.jsonCopy paste the following json file. Update the XXX under URL with your namespace name that was created in Azure. Updae the XXX key with your personal Azure key. If you are unsure of where to find the Key please review notes on https://github.com/BretStateham/connectthedots/blo...{  \"event\": \"ConnectTheDots\", \n \"url\": \"https://XXXXXXX-ns.servicebus.windows.net/ehdevices/messages\", \n \"requestType\": \"POST\", \n \"json\": { \n \"subject\": \"{{s}}\", \n \"unitofmeasure\": \"{{u}}\", \n \"measurename\": \"{{m}}\", \n \"value\": \"{{v}}\", \n \"organization\": \"{{o}}\", \n \"displayname\": \"{{d}}\", \n \"location\": \"{{l}}\", \n \"timecreated\": \"{{SPARK_PUBLISHED_AT}}\", \n \"guid\": \"{{SPARK_CORE_ID}}\"}, \"azure_sas_token\": { \n \"key_name\": \"D1\", \n \"key\": \"XXXXXXXXXXX\" \n }, \n \"mydevices\": true \n}\n\n5) From the command prompt, get in the same folder as the webhook.json file you downloaded, and run$ particle webhook create webhook.json\n$ particle webhook listFrom your Azures account restart your aggregator (step 9 on https://github.com/BretStateham/connectthedots/tree/master/HOLs/Azure/AzurePrep ) and you should then start getting data posted to your cloud instance in Azure.
