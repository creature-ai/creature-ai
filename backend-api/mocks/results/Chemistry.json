Distillation without an Oil bath can lead to cracks in the flask potentially causing an explosion. Sulfuric acid 98% is an extremely powerful acid wear thick Nitrile gloves (Min) to protect yourself from skin contact. Acid burns, especially at this concentration, really hurt. Making ester often requires concentrated organic acid which is corrosive and toxic. Wear a face shield. For the esters, it should be done in a well-ventilated area. For the reflux and the prep of the herbal soxhlet extraction always check on it 10-15 minutes and do not leave it on for long periods of time (Max 6 hours a day).Most ethanol you can buy 70 percent is pretty good however in some cases when you make ester (Ethyl acetate, Ethyl formate, etc) you require Ultra pure ethanol. 70% ethanol can be salted out easily.Here is a video on how to convert 70 percent ethanol into 95 percent min ethanol by salting out.Here another Video from Troll face on salting out yes for many soluble alcohols (Methyl, Ethyl, and Isopropyl) as primary alc you can use this method for very pure alcohol.How to use a Soxhlet extractor.

frustrating!\u00a0 It has been covered in countless instructables regarding etching on metal using the ironing method.\u00a0 Regardless of what etching solution you use the process is the same.\u00a0 Sadly I don't really think my methods improve much on others methods other then perhaps I skip parts of the process they use.\u00a0 The biggest tip I can offer however may seem like a bit of redundancy and is learned from messing up this very instructable, it will be covered in step 6 once you have applied the toner to the metal.\u00a0 Always learning I guess.\u00a0\nChoosing your medium\n\t\tFind some \"cheap\" high gloss paper.\u00a0 This is actually trickier then it sounds as the whole point behind most high gloss papers is to provide a surface that produces excellent photo reproduction.\u00a0 So, its designed to absorb and hold the ink on the paper.\u00a0 In reality you are wanting a high gloss paper that does not absorb and or hold the ink.\u00a0 Now of course I am not really talking about ink at all, here we are using toner.\u00a0 But I digress, paper... I have tried a variety of papers with mixed results.\u00a0 All of the high end gloss photo papers worked somewhat ok.\u00a0 Sections of toner would transfer, but some sections no matter how much heat or pressure applied would transfer the toner.\u00a0 This resulted in splotchy transfers.\u00a0 I then tried using the coated paper found under sticker sheets.\u00a0 This worked well for the transfer, but the initial printing due to its ultra slickness left lateral tracking lines of toner.\u00a0 Lastly I tried something similar to magazine print.\u00a0 It was the cover sheet advertising loose leaf paper from staples.\u00a0 Found when you buy small packs of loose leaf paper, its the top colour sheet advertising staples brand paper that is vacuum sealed in the plastic pack.\u00a0 The only trouble is you get one sheet per pack.\u00a0 This is what I used for the photo.\u00a0 When I went through the process it left an icky white fuzz of dissolved paper, later I discovered this actually a good thing.\u00a0 I used another brand for the Daves name.\u00a0 The toner transferred awesome and left no paper residue.\u00a0 i thought it would turn out even better, boy was I wrong.\u00a0 The additional paper helped resist the etching solution.\u00a0 Suffice to say the photos pure black sections are ultra smooth.\u00a0 Where as Dave's name is actually quite mottled.\u00a0 Of course most people think this is intentional and I let them think that...\n\t\tThe kind of toner used varies just as much as the paper.\u00a0 I have found the best toner is always just the old school black kind found in old photocopiers.\u00a0 I have a colour laser printer at work that prints beautifully and transfers toner well for the ironing method.\u00a0 But it doesn't resist the etching solution all that well.\u00a0 Unfortunately i discovered this while doing this very instructable.\u00a0 Both the photo and the wording degraded more then I liked.\u00a0 If this is the only toner you have available, limit your time in the dip tank later on, and or check it often = which is what I should have done - doh!\u00a0 In my initial etch of the tattoo pedal I used toner printed from a old photo copier found at my local Shoppers Drug mart.\u00a0 It was looked and felt layered on, this is what you want.\u00a0 The script on the tattoo plate held up amazingly well, to actually feel the depth of the etch just can be expressed in a photo.\u00a0 Anyway enough prattle, lets begin.\n\t\tInsert paper into printing machine of choice\n\t\tSend image to printing machine, ensuring it is a reverse image\n\t\tRetrieve image and look for irregularities in the print job\n\t\tRepeat at nausea.... Why?\u00a0 I don't care if you are new to this or have done it a hundred times, errors will occur.\u00a0 It is much better to have a couple extra sheets lying around if the first one magically goes on perfectly, then to have to go back in the middle of the game to print out more sheets.\n\t\tAt this point your tonerized is susceptible to smearing, treat it gently.\u00a0 Of course this make the next step tricky, but worth it.\u00a0 Flip your image over and lightly trace in PENCIL the perimeter of the image.\u00a0 You will use this tracing when you line up the image on you plate as the toner will be facing down.\u00a0 You will not regret this step!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2Y/04RU/GWF6EK2J/F2Y04RUGWF6EK2J.LARGE.jpg",

is nice and smooth and your ready to apply the toner?\u00a0 Lets get started\n\n\t\tHeat up your iron, I set mine between cotton and linen - ensure you are not using steam.\u00a0 If your iron doesn't let you turn off steam, make sure to drain it first of any water\n\t\tlay out a towel on your work surface\n\t\tlay your plate on the towel - the towel helps the plate from moving around\n\t\tCarefully lay your image toner side down on the plate, lining up the image where you want it.\u00a0 Aren't you thankful you traced in pencil on the backside now?\n\t\tOthers usually put something over the image at this point.\u00a0 I don't bother.\u00a0 Just lay your iron over the image gently, try not to move your image.\u00a0 Let the iron just sit there for 4-5 minutes.\u00a0 This will cause some of the toner to stick to the plate effectively gluing it on.\u00a0 Gently begin to move the iron all over the image in lazy circles for several minutes with light pressure.\n\t\tNow increase the pressure moving laterally back and forth and side to side for several minutes,\u00a0 Always keeping mind you could shift the paper which is not good!\u00a0 Doesn't hurt to hold down the edge of the paper with a gloved hand to keep it from shifting.\u00a0 Your essentially burnished at this point, soon you will begin to see your image through the paper, but not always.\n\t\tIts patience time.\u00a0 Turn off your iron and walk away for 1/2 hour to let it cool.\u00a0 Do not plunge it into cold water to speed up the cooling process.\u00a0 You can develop steam jackets that can lift your toner you just worked so hard to apply right off the plate.\n\t\tOnce its cool enough to handle comfortably toss it in a bucket/sink of room temperature water.\u00a0 Resist the urge to use hot water to speed it up.\u00a0 Once again, walk away for 1/2 hour.\n\t\tBy now your paper should be nice and soggy but dont just try to peel the whole paper off.\u00a0 Instead using just your finger tips rub the paper.\u00a0 After a minute or so, the paper should begin to ball up under your fingers.\u00a0 Keep going, abrading the paper on with your finger tips.\u00a0 After 5 minutes or so the paper should be disintegrated and your image now right side up will be revealed.\u00a0 It will most likely be nice and dark with the odd speck missing.\u00a0 Those missing speck can be touched up easily enough with some paint.\u00a0 however if large portions are missing or lots if intricate detail will have to be painted on, I hate to say you may have to start over.\u00a0 Re-sand and start

noticed that your image has gone from a nice dark colour to a whitish fuzz, this is fine and actually desirable.\u00a0 Your sections that have no toner where toner is supposed to be is not desirable though.\u00a0 You can use a variety of touch up methods at this point.\nOptionsIron another image.\u00a0 I decided to iron on the picture first, then go back and apply my lettering.\u00a0 In the pictures you will notice the image and the words are of a different colour, this is because I used a different kind of paper that left no fuzz.\u00a0 In theory you could iron in small sections as well, though I think this may prove problematic.\u00a0Paint.\u00a0 This is the method of choice for touch ups, in addition to reinforcing your toner.\u00a0 This is what i should have done for the image and Dave's name.\u00a0 It is what I did on the tattoo pedal, and the results were clear at the end.\u00a0 Now you may ask yourself if this is redundant, or why bother using toner at all?\u00a0 Well, if you are that good of a painter be my guest.\u00a0 Myself, I have found over the years I have fell out of practice of painting free hand with any level of quality.\u00a0 However painting over the existing black toner is simple with a nice thin enamel and a quality fine tipped paint brush.\u00a0 You can use model paint or even nail polish just as long as it is an enamel paint that has been thinned a little.\u00a0 Model paint and nail polish especially are to thick to paint with any fine detail.\u00a0 So paint in any missing parts and while your at it, go over your toner sections as well.\n\t\tWax or Vinyl.\u00a0 I have seen others paint on wax or even use sections of sticky vinyl cut out and applied.\u00a0 I really can't judge it as I have not tried it.\u00a0 I don't know if I would use though as the solution literally boils with a exothermic reaction.\u00a0 Quite a bit of heat is generated so it has the potentially to melt off the wax or break down the glues holding the vinyl on.\nLastly, perhaps you have a section of toner applied that now you wish you hadn't.\u00a0 No problem.\u00a0 Either use a small file, you own nail or even a small piece of sand paper to scratch off the toner.\u00a0 Don't worry if you muck up the plate with scratches as that whole section will be eaten smooth later on in the dip process.\n        ", "step_imgs":

cast effect that can only be appreciated in real life, pictures just don't do it justice.\u00a0 But each to his own.\u00a0 Either way you will have to apply paint to the edge of the metal and the entire backside of the plate to protect it from being eaten away.\u00a0 In theory you could apply the frame using the toner method, but that seems like a lot of extra work that take minutes with paint, and you would still need to paint the edges at least.\u00a0 I found the easiest method was to have my plate raised on something that would allow my fingers the space to grab the plate from top and bottom of the middle to flip it after.\u00a0 First I painted the frame.\u00a0 The carefully flipped it over resting it on the middle of the plate.\u00a0 Then i painted the edges and

pedal\n\t\tMuriatic acid all though not the strongest acid out there should be treated with respect.\u00a0 When I bought it, it came in a 1.5 litre bottle that was wrapped in a second layer in the form of a heat sealed plastic bag.\u00a0 I decided to open the bag with just bare hands thinking it was all sealed.\u00a0 Whoops, a tiny trace amount of the acid got on the side of my thumb and I immediately felt it going to work.\u00a0 The pain was incredible as it quickly dissolved a few milometers of my epidermis about the size of a pencil eraser head, with odd looking striations edging out from the initial wound.\u00a0 The wound took about a week to heal and hurt almost the whole time.\u00a0 USE SAFETY GEAR!!!, just imagine what that would have done to my eyes - very scary shit indeed - sorry for the potty mouth\n\t\tMistake No.2 - When you mix up your chemicals, never walk away from it.\u00a0 I mixed my solution, dropped in my plate and watched as nothing much happened.\u00a0 Sure, some little bubbles started to form on the bare aluminum and rise up like weak club soda, but not the reaction I was looking for.\u00a0 I was expecting a flurry of activity where none was taking place, so I left the detached garage where I was working and went back inside to look at the formula thinking I had done something wrong.\u00a0 I thought at this rate it will take hours! That's when I read the exothermic reaction takes a minute or two get started.\u00a0 It hadn't been 5 minutes when I walked back out side and promptly heard a continuous whooshing sound coming from the garage, and noticed a copious amount of yellow tinged gas streaming out of the open garage door - which leads to my next mistake.\n\t\tMistake No.3 - When someone says to do a certain type of work with plenty of ventilation, really you should be doing it outside! Not in a small shed with one small door open as your source of ventilation.\u00a0\u00a0 I was lucky as I had taken my full face gas mask with me inside.\u00a0 I used to work in a paper mill where you are exposed to all sorts of lethal gases.\u00a0 I ran into the garage, plucked the way to shallow tub of boiling acid up with some tongs and took it outside where I promptly dumped a bucket full of snow in it to dilute the reaction.\u00a0 After much cleanup and fanning out of my garage the dangers were over.Aside from that, etching the family portrait went off with out a hitch!\n\t\tEnsure your tub is wide enough to just hold your plate laying down, but ensure it is at least 5 inches deep to contain splashing boiling acid!\n\t\tPlan where you are going to do the dip, the chemicals when mixed produce toxic fumes but its when you introduce the aluminum that the real nasty gases are produced.\u00a0 Make sure your area is extremely well ventilated - ideal is outside, which is where I did it.\u00a0 This time...\n\t\tGet your safety gear on prior to starting, its not going to help you when you are on the ground with your melting out of your sockets and your lungs have withered away like deflated balloons!\u00a0 At the absolute minimum be wearing splash goggles and rubber gloves.\u00a0 Really though, a full face gas mask with appropriate filters is best.\u00a0 Your face is protected, and you can breath still - breathing, that's a nice perk\n\t\tOnce you are all Darth Vader-ed up you can mix your chemicals.\u00a0 The ratio is 2 parts 3% Hydrogen peroxide to 1 part muriatic acid - in that order!\u00a0 Never add the peroxide to the acid as it can cause an unstable reaction", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F03/AR4U/GWF5U4BI/F03AR4UGWF5U4BI.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Mix"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "\n          Ready to dip your plate?HEY, WHY NO PHOTOS OF THIS STEP?

This is an automobile part, normally attached to an exhaust manifold to reclaim power for the engine. This is not entirely important for our purposes, what is important, however, is that it has a fan and a compressor, which make up the heart of a jet engine. The turbo needs to be obtained first, as its dimensions serve as the basis for the other parts of the system, such as the combustion chamber, and the flame tube. This is the part that the system is made around as it has a turbine in the back end, which the heat from the flame tube feeds directly into and a compressor which keeps air flowing into the chamber, and going through the holes of the flame tube, so as to keep the ratio of air to fuel proper for combustion. Above is a diagram of the airflow through the jet engine.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F1Y/QQQF/HVP6GXOX/F1YQQQFHVP6GXOX.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Acquiring the Turbocharger."}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The step that follows acquiring a turbo is to determine how the combustion chamber will be built. The combustion chamber consists, in essence, of three parts: the outer housing, the flame tube, and the end piece that allows the part to be bolted to the turbo. The flame tube needs to have a diameter of twice the turbo intake. This can be found by measuring across the turbine on the intake side of the turbo. In general the intake side is the half of the turbo with a more metallic shine and is less corroded. The flame tube needs sets of holes to distribute the fuel into the combustion chamber. The overall area of these holes must add up to percentages of the area of the turbo intake. These percentages, for three sets of holes, are 30% for the first set, 20% for the second set and 50% for the third set. For our turbo the diameter of the intake is 1.5 in. and therefore the area is 1.76 in^2. 30% of that is 0.53 in^2. This first set of holes should have the most holes, for even fuel distribution, so somewhere between 10-30 depending on the size of the turbo. A larger turbo intake would allow for more holes, as the area that is used to determine the size would be larger. For ours we are using 10 holes, at 1/8 in each. This was found with 0.53 / 10 = 0.053. 0.053 = pi R^2 = 0.129 in = R. This number is not exactly practical to use so we are going to go with a close approximation of 1/8 in, as that is .125 only 4 thousandths difference. For the second set of flame tube holes 20% of the area of the intake is 1.76 /100 X 20 which is .35. We are using 4 holes at 11/64 each. This is done with the same math as before, .35 / 5 =0.0875 0.0875 = pi R^2 = 0.166 which would be about 4/25th. This is again not a standard drill bit size, so instead we would be using an 11/64th which is about 0.17. The last set of holes is at 50% of the turbo intake area, and these are drilled out to fewer and larger holes, so as to allow a large flow of fuel into the chamber. Same math as the previous two sets  50% of 1.76 which is 0.88. for the last section we are using 5 holes at 1/4. 0.88 / 5 = 0.176. 0.176 = pi R^2 = 0.246 rounded up to .25 which is 1/4.

The house is just a steel tube 1 or 2 inches larger in diameter than the flame tube. The two tubes are connected by a flat steel ring on the side that goes into the turbo. The other side of the combustion chamber is closed off with an end cap, a flat steel circle, that closes off both the flame tube and outer cylinder. To connect the combustion chamber to the turbo a steel reducer needs to be fabricated. This goes on the part that would normally be attached to the manifold of the car. The way we did this was by first cutting the piece that attaches to the turbo out of 1/8 inch steel, and drilling holes for the the threaded bolts coming out of the turbo to go through. we also cut a hole in the center that lines up with the hole in the turbo, naturally, as it allows necessary air flow. With this piece completed. The reduction part can be added, we made this by cutting four equal pieces of 1/8 inch steel with a 3.5 inch bottom length and a 1.5 inch top length. By welding these pieces into a pyramid, and attaching the recently created flat mounting piece, a reducer that is made to attach to the turbo can be created.

The plate on the reducer should fit over the threaded rods coming from the turbo, and nuts can be threaded on over them to tighten it in place. The last part of the assembly is to connect the outlet of the compressor end of the turbo to outer casing of the combustion chamber. This functions to force air into the flame tube holes, and enables combustion in the flame tube, which is forced into the turbine of the turbo. The spinning of the turbine also spins the intake fan, and allows the system to continue running. We used plumbing black pipe for this, as it was readily available at home improvement stores, and can be purchased in threaded sections. The parts that connected to the outlet of the turbo, and the inlet of the chamber were welded on. The pipe piece that connected into the chamber needed to be ground into a shape that would fit flush against the side of the combustion chamber outer tube.

The fuel will go into the back end of the combustion chamber, via a valve located in the center, inline with the flame tube. The Ignition system is a small spark plug, from either from a small gas engine, or automobile. A battery to power the spark plug is needed, and if a liquid fuel with a pump is used, then a power supply for the fuel pump is also necessary. For our system we used a 12 volt battery, and a simple push button to spark the system into combustion.

Here's the link: https://www.instructables.com/id/The-Harmless-Bomb/Here's how you can make it the way I made it in 9 easy steps:Gather up about 100 ml Hydrogen Peroxide (6% w/v), a pinch of Potassium Permanganate and a small, but tough 400 ml plastic bottle. (You can mess around with bottles of different sizes).  Then fill about one-sixth of the bottle with Hydrogen Peroxide.  Then, take a pinch of Potassium Permanganate and add it to the Peroxide.  The moment you put the crystals in the bottle, you closed the cap of the bottle and screw it tightly. (This takes a longer time to read than actually doing it). MUST BE DONE EXTREMELY FAST. AVOID ANY TIME LAG.  The moment you close the lid, give the bottle a shake. An intense reaction between the two will occur:   Reaction: KMnO4 + H2O2  --> K2O2 + MnO2 + H2O + O2 (unbalanced) The H2O and O2 released in the bottle will increase the pressure because the volume remaining constant, the moles keep on increasing.  After that, you'll see that the bottle has stiffened up to its fullest. If you've taken a tough bottle, don't worry, it won't burst. Keep the bottle on the ground.  Now, with your left foot, pin the middle of the bottle to the ground. Place your right foot on the neck of the bottle.  With a sharp pull, pull your right leg towards yourself, in order to open the bottle with your foot.Now, with a BANG!, at a supersonic speed, the bottle cap will hurl ahead!

This is not a build for the timid. Only build in a well ventilated area.After several years of various experiments, I came upon a workable battery chemistry that is light, safer than Lead-Acid, and easy to make.  My original intention was to create a battery that could be manufactured in low-tech environments with limited supplies, and I think I came very close to that ideal with this battery.After searching the google patent database, I do not believe this idea to be patented.  I decided that I could not ever stand to fight the big companies in court if anyone tried to challenge a patent on the material, and I couldn't defend the patent either - as that requires lots of legal representation and great expense. So, in the interest of having my little battery get in the hands of people who need it most - I decided to open source it.  I decided to completely share how I built this little guy, and replicate it here with a fresh cell - proving that the technology works.Composition: Aluminum/AlCl + Hcl + TiO2 + MgO2 + Graphite + Urea (+ mineral oil)Voltage: 2.10v OCV, the body of work from 2.05v down to 1.80v very similar to lead acidMy current battery appears to still be conditioning, and seems to hold slightly higher voltages for longer each day.  I don't know the eventual lifespan or final voltage of this battery, so this is still an unknown.  But the behavior seems to reinforce a 2.1v resting voltage, which might eventually be as high as 2.25v.NOTE: Danger. Be cautious, and wear protective eye wear and disposable gloves. While the battery is ultimately composed of chemicals that are far less nasty than Lead, they are still dangerous.  Hydrochloric Acid can burn you, your children, pets, your clothing, the desk - just about anything around you. Chlorine/Oxygen Gas Hazard: Charging this battery can cause a release of oxygen, which can cause fires. Over charging this battery can cause the release of Chlorine Gas (Cl2) which is nasty stuff. Only build in a well ventilated space, and do not leave an unattended battery charging.Environmental Note: Do not dump out your battery outside or in the sink. Dispose of battery solutions at your local Hazardous materials collection times.  Again, this battery is far less nasty than many, but there's no reason to pollute your local watershed.

Nickel-Iron batteries are very popular for solar projects.  They were patented by Thomas Edison and Co around 1900.   They hold a 1.2v charge, were nearly indestructible, able to be deep  discharged and overcharged, and have lifespans in the range of 50-100  years. Drawbacks included a high rate of self discharge, weight, and  electrolyte maintenance. The first electric cars at the time ran on  these 1.2v batteries, and both fell out of favor with the introduction  of internal combustion engines.  Today, thanks to a resurgence in  offgrid/microgrid ideas, these batteries are back in favor - being  manufactured here in the US and in China.  They are expensive, and made  of plastic instead of all steel - and I doubt their 50 year lifespan..  but that aside, what's the interesting thing here? No patent.  Who  cares, people will buy them and the big companies don't care about appealing to offgrid types.  Once I  had a good long think about it, I didn't really see the need for a  patent for a battery like this.  I couldn't defend a patent in court against a mega-corporation if they wanted to steal the idea anyway, they'd bleed me dry in no time.  The patent system as it exists today isn't for the small inventor, it's for corporations to wage battle against each other and maintain their competitive edge.  This battery isn't super efficient, it's cheap, simple, lightweight and relatively benign.  Which makes it perfect for someone in the middle of no-where to use to keep a light on.I'm a software developer, and have been for nearly 20 years. I developed software for primarily windows-based systems for the first 8 or 10 or  so, and then progressed into primarily web-based projects for the rest.   Open source software has allowed me to focus on building the solution  on powerful software stacks without having to worry about piracy, or  licenses, or running out of money before the project even starts because  we need the latest versions of the entire OS stack.  Go find a  community with similar needs and an existing stack, and start building.   Give back to the community, and build open products and solutions for  others to use.  So, this is me giving back.So go, build batteries, and make the  world a better place.  This is my gift to you.This instructable is meant to be the  springboard for other experimenters who might wish to help the community  develop this battery, share in the general knowledge in its  construction, and make the world a better place.

It worked, but suffered greatly from self-discharge, in a matter of minutes.  It showed promise, but went away too quickly.  After much experimentation, I discovered the TiO2 and MgO gave the battery a \"depth\" of charge, likely due to electrodeposition of the metals within the electrolyte... more later in the \"Theory of Operation\" section.Graphite - fancy or simple, graphite is graphite.  My base cell actually used a block shaped piece of artists graphite, you could use whatever - even mechanical pencil leads... all the way to expensive graphite blocks or activated carbon blocks.  Carbon is your friend.Powdered Titanium Dioxide is used in white paint, food coloring, and all kinds of household products. It is, as far as most uses around the house are concerned, inert. I sourced mine from a pottery supply company online.  You could easily find it in large bags from cake or soapmaking suppliers.  Versatile stuff.Magnesium Oxide is used as an antacid, becoming Magnesium Hydroxide when mixed with water. It is somewhat caustic.Our goal is to combine these with HCl, and facilitate their reaction into TiCl and MgCl and have them play with the AlCl as our electrolyte.  I'm not sure this actually happens in the base cell until we have a Deep Eutectic Solvent (more later) formed with the urea.Aluminum Chloride is kind of nasty.  Wear gloves.  I did not purchase mine, but made it by dissolving Aluminum foil in diluted HCl. The next step will detail how I did this, and why it was stupid to do it indoors.  If you purchase AlCl anhydrous, know that you must be very careful not to spill it, and to wear a mask - it's very bad for your lungs.  Water: Any extra water will eventually have to be electrolyzed out before the battery will come to full potential. some water is necessary to slow down the AlCl reaction if you make it yourself... so it just takes longer to condition the battery.Hydrochloric Acid is nasty stuff.  Be careful with it.  I purchased 200 plastic eye droppers to measure and dispense. It reacts with water in the air, in your nose, your throat and lungs. Ventilation is your friend.  I purchased the acid at my local hardware store, generally used for cleaning brick or concrete as \"Muriatic Acid\"Urea is a main component of urine. I did not use urine.  I used a spreadable \"de-icer\" that is composed mostly of urea.  Also, it has a pretty blue color.  Some gardening centers may also sell urea as fertilizer.  This is the hydrogen bond donator for our DES.  This was a later addition in my original working battery, but I'm going to add it upfront when making the electrolyte for this one.  Gloves are probably a good idea.UPDATE 9/9/2015Borax (Sodium Tetra Borate) is a water softener that can be purchased in your laundry aisle, it also works as a flux in soldering, and seems to assist the power retention and output capabilities of the battery.AGAIN: Most sidewalk salt is just salt, KCl or NaCl - these are not substitutes for the urea.  If you can't find this stuff (say in a warm climate), look in a garden center for a urea fertilizer. You could always make it yourself, but thats a whole other instructible involving urine.Gloves: Heck, just wear gloves all the time - you can buy a box of 50 for a few dollars.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F3M/LXNE/IDYKDIGQ/F3MLXNEIDYKDIGQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F96/6FJZ/IDYKDIHV/F966FJZIDYKDIHV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHX/W6F7/IDYKDIGV/FHXW6F7IDYKDIGV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRN/4N2Z/IDYP2311/FRN4N2ZIDYP2311.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZR/6SN2/IDYP23WL/FZR6SN2IDYP23WL.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Components: Graphite, Titanium Dioxide, Mangesium Oxide, HCl, Aluminum Chloride, and Urea"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "I'm American, so I feel compelled to tell you about safety... especially with the possibility of our younger viewers messing with this stuff (Only attempt with a responsible sober adult nearby, hopefully YOU are the responsible sober adult).

Baking soda will nuetralize acid while you run for the shower.  It will also neutralize spills... eventually.  Keep pouring it on and rinsing off until you stop feeling like a clumsy fool.

In an acidic solution, you're going to corrode the living crud out of anything you use as the positive terminal.  It's going to literally fly apart.

I've considered Manganese Dioxide for a positive electrode, but I'm not sure it will \"stay put\", I'll leave that experiment to someone else.  Because we \"eventually\" convert all the Hcl to various chlorides, it is possible that an aluminum or other cathode (+), but that would require some additional experimentation. copper, iron, manganese dioxide are all good candidates.I'm using pyrolytic graphite, specifically scrap from glassmaking.  I'm going to be trying \"graphite gasket\" material eventually as well.Powdered graphite?  I haven't tried it, but I don't see why not. Getting it to stay put is probably the challenge, or compressing it into a block, or mix with JUST enough epoxy to hold it together.Carbon Fiber/other forms of carbon:  In some early experiments, non-graphite carbon flakes off into tiny bits of black evil stuff that cloud the electrolyte, and possibly cause the battery to stop working.  it wasn't exactly a success. Perhaps a \"conditioned battery\" could have a carbon fiber or sheet added, so the charging isn't outgassing a destroying the electrode.the JBWeld here is also an experiment.  I've used gorilla glue and  silicone to protect my metal leads, and it worked well - but I wanted to see if something stronger would work.  if you leave your metal leads exposed, they will corrode.  If they are made of steel, you also risk releasing chromate, which is nasty stuff.NOTE: I'm not sure if the JB Weld failed, but the bubbling of the electrolyte completely dissolved the steel wire in just a few hours - I replaced with a graphite stick.

I made the initial mistake of doing it indoors the first time, and it took quite a while to vent my lab.I made my original AlCl over the course of several weeks, 1 Cup of water in a pyrex container (or Ball canning jar), 5mL of HCl, and lots of little strips of Aluminum.

I'm using Aluminum screen for  my anode(-), and I want to see how it reacts in the paste, or if the  addition of AlCl keeps the anode(-) from being dissolved by the acid.I  started adding HCl (5ml at a time), but realized that the TiCl wants to  react with the humidity in the air to make a toxic vapor.  So, I added  100ml of bottled water instead, then proceeded with 4 x 5mL droppers of  Hcl into the jar. The powders formed a thick paste. I closed the jar (loosely) to allow the reaction to  proceed.  The jar became warm.  I left the jar for 24 hours.I  added 1/8 cup (~50mL) of urea granules (SafeTPet), and heat the mixture  in a microwave until it begins to melt.  If you use a microwave, know  that the urea will start giving off ammonia gas if you leave it too  long. Only short pulses.  And clean that sucker out before you make  popcorn... or get a dedicated \"mad science\" microwave for your lab. Once I can see the solvent is liquid and mixed with the TiO2, I proceeded to construct the cell.It only took about 30 seconds in the microwave to have much of the granules dissolve into the paste, which changed consistency from an extremely thick paste to a \"watery\" pale blue. The jar was extremely hot, be careful.  While some of this might just be urea reacting with the Hcl residue, it's our starting point for constructing the battery. In a proper lab, without having to resort to additional water, and just building the battery, it would likely not have the length conditioning step that mine requires to get rid of all the excess water.TiO2 will convert to TiCl4 in the presence of HCl, but water will cause it to revert back to TiO2 as Hcl.  I think the MgO stays as MgCl, and the urea will form Ammonium Chloride, but I've noticed - once the water has left the system (via evaporation or hydrolysis), the resulting solution forms a gel, and no longer electrolyzes - consistent with a DES.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FD7/GO6A/IE08MEIK/FD7GO6AIE08MEIK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIU/NJJV/IE08MEQU/FIUNJJVIE08MEQU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYH/GN1X/IE08MES3/FYHGN1XIE08MES3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNA/Z6DA/IE08MEW8/FNAZ6DAIE08MEW8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFN/XWYV/IDZSJ4QQ/FFNXWYVIDZSJ4QQ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Making the Electrolyte (Deep Eutectic Solvent)"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "In this experiment, I'm using Aluminum window screen for my anode(-) and also using Tyvek as a membrane between my graphite cathode(+) and the aluminum.

He would sell something called \"battery oil\", which was just mineral oil (baby oil without any scent added), which sealed out the atmosphere, but allowed generated hydrogen or oxygen gasses to bubble out.The only problem I see, is that you can't really mess with the battery once you add this... you risk your electrodes getting coated in oil and being rendered useless.So mineral oil is a final step.  Once you're satisfied with the construction, you add the oil.

Then, fed up, I left it at 12v all day - and it suddenly improved.  After a good 12v charge, I could do slower 3v change/discharges and get a lot more power out of the thing.  Also, this was when I noticed that it stopped bubbling, or only bubbled occasional small single bubbles.  These are oxygen from the Titanium (or magnesium, or aluminum) Oxides being electrolyzed. A slow charge doesn't seem to make much of these.So, it takes a while to get most of the water out of the mix.  This can be done fast or slow, but you're going to have to expend a lot of energy doing it.  Having pure Chlorides to start with would change this.  For now, it's a reality.So, Conditioning: Run it up (3-12v until it stabilizes), run it down to something like 1.5v - repeat.  At first you kind of have to run it down lower (0.9v to 1v) to get it set up for better charges later.  In general, 3v for 8 hours @ 1 amp will charge it nicely.  I have no idea how many cycles it takes to get it right.  My little version of this one seems to still be improving, and it's probably upwards of 100 cycles right now.  I may try a standard NiMH charger and see what happens.I still do not know the best voltage.  -1.63v is the voltage to deposit aluminum, -1.67v for titanium, -2.37v for magnesium. which give us ~3.34v for titanium  ~3.26v for aluminum and 4.74v for magnesium.  I wouldn't hold my breath on electrodepositing magnesium.  BUT,  a 3.34v@1amp charge takes a long time.  I suppose I should invest in a power supply that can push 3 or 4 amps at that voltage.Honestly, this step is probably the thing I could use the most help on. Any ideas are appreciated.UPDATE (9/9/15): If it doesn't want to condition, or doesn't hold power - try reversing the voltage -12v or so for 10 minutes, followed by long 3.5v charge - there seems to be a passivation layer that can build up that must be overcome.  This might be something to do in general long-term maintenance as well.NOTE: Water will electrolyze at our charge voltages (which are somewhere in the neighborhood of 2.5 - 3.11v), Chlorine will start bubbling out if you run the battery at too high of a voltage.  If you smell any Chlorine in the room, turn the voltage down until you find the sweet spot. Also, a Well Ventilated Room.Voltage on the cell *seems* to want to hang out at 2.5v, which is our theoretical sweet spot - but Most of my experiments seem to settle over several hours to around 2.1v, hanging out for a long time around 2.0v .. discharge seems to really happen between 2.0v and 1.8v.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 9: Conditioning the Battery"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "My initial experiment used a graphite/clay artist's graphite, rolled/cut aluminum foil, with maybe the surface area of a button cell battery in the electrolyte.

I don't need batteries sitting charged for a month, generate/store/use within 24 hours.To this end, I can do an 8 hour charge with that small cell 3v@1amp , and then light a 1.7v red LED and 1k resistor for about 5 or 6 hours... not exactly good, but that's part of the reason I'm building this bigger one..

The anode definitely affects the final voltage, as does the ratios of Urea/Hcl/Metal Chlorides ...

Lastly, Methoxide, the substance produced when you mix your catalyst with the methanol, is an extremely toxic nerve agent. It can do some serious bodily damage.

You will get arrested and get in a pile of trouble if you just take the oil. Avoid burnt oil, as this will not react to make biodiesel. Most fast food places burn their oil. -A catalyst: NaOH (sodium hydroxide) or KOH (potassium hydroxide)  The difference? well, KOH dissolves better in the methanol and NaOH tends to make the final byproduct (glycerin) more congealed.

A good way to store utensils is to separate them into materials, i.e. rubber, scrap metal, scrap glass, chemicals, etc. The more meticulous one is, the easier it will become to locate needed materials for a procedure. \u00a0Safety First!: There are certain safety rules you must follow, and these should be present within a given procedure. As a general rule, \u00a0ALWAYS Use chemical gloves, an old coat, and safety goggles. Do not drink or eat during a procedure. Use closed toe shoes (no sandals). Also, experiments producing gas should be done outside or under a ventilation directing device. Remember that a safety shower and wash station is readily available in the home in the form of a shower, sink, or hose. \u00a0Please watch this video, as it is very comprehensive on home chemistry safety: \u00a0Home Science Safety VideoAcids/Bases: An acid contributes hydrogen cations (protons) to a solution, whereas a base donates an electron pair (this is a simplified definition). When diluting an acid,\u00a0\u00a0pour the acid into water (or base). \u00a0A video introduction on acids and bases (30 min).\u00a0Waste:\u00a0The lab must be meticulously clean while not in use. There must be two separate waste receptacles: one plastic pail for hazardous waste (i.e., broken glass,\u00a0flammable\u00a0substances ) and another for regular waste. For hazardous chemicals, methods of disposing are usually on the labels of bottles. If in doubt, do some research on local recycling and collecting centers.\u00a0Labeling: Make sure to always label chemicals stored in vials correctly. A rigorous approach would require that molar concentrations and safety information also be\u00a0labeled. \u00a0Also label storage compartments with their contents (see picture). These compartments would vary depending on the scope of each lab, though a good rule is to store tools and spare parts separately. \u00a0Environment: It is always a good idea to build your lab near a window or well ventilated area. Make sure that you save space by using organizers as depicted in my mini lab setup. Good lighting is important when carrying out experiments. It's also a good idea to have a designated area outside of your house for experiments which may require it. Always know what you are doing in an experiment, as it may not be stated explicitly that gas products may form.\u00a0Lab Aesthetics: A poorly conceived lab will just look like clutter. It is important to make it stand out - it will add a very nice vibe to your house. You should store large containers out of sight and only have a few chemicals on display.

I spent an hour and a half to get QD's just using baking soda. The sucrose would only decompose to Glucose and Fructose at high temperatures for extended periods of time. When simple sugars are in a basic solution, they can form the quantum dots. So using the acid and heat, I made lots of free fructose and glucose, but then I had to make the solution basic again. So we added baking soda to neutralize the acid, but that isn't enough, when acetic acid and baking soda mix, they form sodium acetate which acts as a weakly acidic buffer solution.

If not, I can certainly give you a few:The application common to all my fellow hobbyists and DIYers is purifying water, since we all use water numerous times daily. If you need to purify water and remove contaminants from it, you could do so by distillation. This might be done for drinking or use in a humidifier. Keep in mind that, while we can purify by distillation with a simple apparatus like this, that a fraction of the impurities will still remain. Many hobbyists who construct devices for distillation, however, are doing so with alcohol in mind. When working with alcohol, though, there are more complicated factors that I, being one who doesn't drink, am unfamiliar with. If you do want to distill alcohol, check whether or not it's legal where you are and then consult an experienced guide. Also, be sure it won't cause your distillation tube to degrade - many companies post free solvent/plastic compatibility charts like this one online - and find a heat source that doesn't involve an open flame. (I'm sure you knew better, but a reminder couldn't hurt.) But why do I want to build a distillation apparatus? Amateur chemists often find commercial suppliers for reagents in everything from garden to automotive supply stores, and sometimes these finds require concentration, purification, or separation. In my case, I've been interested for a while in polymers and I'd love to make my own - I know of plastics made from borax and glue, milk (its protein casein), corn starch, agar, and gelatin Ethylene glycol is readily available as antifreeze, but other chemicals are added - I want to isolate ethylene glycol because of its dual hydroxyl groups, which I'm hoping will be useful in polymerization.   I mentioned before that herbalists might use distillation because essential oils can be distilled to concentrate them. As with brewing, I'm not involved with any of the details of essential oils, so it's your responsibility to double-check safety and legality here.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: Motivation"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "To start, we need to think about how distillation works. In short, we're using the facts that different liquids will boil at different temperatures to separate liquids, or to separate them from dissolved solids. It's not quite that simple, but the approximation works well enough for our purposes - if the purity isn't high enough after one distillation, we can simply do it again. Anyway, once the distillate has evaporated and most of the other components of your mixture are left behind, it's forced through the distillate tube into the condenser, as that's the only path available. While there it is cooled by the condenser bath and returns to its liquid state, and gravity then pulls it down through the tube into a its new container, separate from the other solutes.In reality, each liquid is independently competing against its own gaseous phase. In a pot of water at room temperature, through Brownian motion molecules are constantly flying free from the liquid into the gaseous atmosphere, but just as many water molecules are diving back in. Overall, there is no change, and we say that the system is in dynamic equilibrium. However, if we put the pot of water on a lit stove, the additional thermal kinetic energy of the water molecules means more are able to break free. Eventually, enough are in the atmosphere that as many come back in as are let loose and we reach equilibrium again. We quantify this in terms of vapor pressure, which is the pressure a vapor exerts when in equilibrium with its condensed (usually liquid) state. The boiling point is simply when the vapor pressure reaches the pressure actually exerted by the surroundings (atmospheric pressure, unless the container is sealed). For that reason, above the boiling point equilibrium no longer involves any liquid - it would all be gaseous. Imagine we're trying to distill isopropyl alcohol (boiling at 180.7\u00b0F) and water (212\u00b0F) - at 180.7\u00b0F, when all the isopropyl alcohol has evaporated, much of the water should also have evaporated at equilibrium - see this Wikipedia page. We can work the system, however, by repeating the distillation process to continue removing about the same proportion of the remaining water. I'm not sure if there's any benefit to trying to work quickly before equilibrium is reached since you'll have less of both fluids in the gas phase, not just less of the one with the higher boiling point, but that may also help.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 2: Scientific Explanation"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Now it's time for the list of materials and a little thought behind each:Distillation vessel - This is the container for your sample you want to distill. Size and shape may matter depending on your heat source - I wanted to keep it simple and use a stove, so the natural choice was a plain old pot. Other thrifty options are a fishbowl or vase if you want glass or a coffee or paint can if metal's your thing. Each has pros and cons. Glass is very inert, has low thermal conductivity, is transparent, and can crack if heated too quickly. Metal is usually stable but can be corroded more easily, has high thermal conductivity, is opaque and won't crack when quickly heated.Lid - I used a glass lid with a ventilation hole I found for $1 at Goodwill. This makes it easy to remove and return the lid if I want to add something to the distillation vessel, and I can see inside. The ventilation hole makes it extremely easy to add the condenser tube - if you can't find one, you could try unscrewing the handle and putting the tube through the screwhole. I wasn't worried about the lid cracking as I turned up the heat because it's not taking heat directly from the stove's flames. It will still be subjected to the high temperatures inside the vessel eventually, though, so it still needs to be able to withstand them.Distillate tube - I don't quite know what mine is made of since I picked it up at the Habitat for Humanity ReStore. I tested it and it seems to work fine, and in fact I was able to take advantage of the way it becomes formable under heat. If you have a metal tube, that would probably be even better since it could dissipate heat more quickly. Plastic and metal (if it's thin enough) can both be wound up inside the condenser too. If your sample is reactive, you may have to find a glass tube and pick a longer container for a condenser. Be warned that in my case the tube began to droop (i.e. it started to melt, but the fire wasn't hot enough for it to melt completely) near the distillation vessel, and some plastics may release undesirable chemicals when heated. I definitely will be improving this design with a metal tube.Condenser bath - I used a plastic jar from Costco's mixed nuts since that was the right size, on hand, and easy to work with. Since we'll be keeping this cool (in comparison to the distillate, at least) I'm not concerned with its stability under high heat.Drainage tube - This tube doesn't need to be anything special; it'll be used to let out warm water and only needs to be flexible and longer than the condenser is tall. That way, we can stop drainage by simply bending the tube upward so gravity holds it in. Alternatively, if you want to be fancy and happen to have a nice manually controlled valve, you could just use that instead.Caulk - I found a tube of kitchen and sink caulk already open in our workshop - lucky me! This is how we'll seal holes we drill in the condenser for the tube. All it needs to be is watertight, so if you don't have this and can find something else that prevents leakage, go for it.Distillate receptacle - When your distillate comes out of the condenser, it'll need somewhere to go. Your choice again depends on the distillate, for as usual, you don't want the distillate and container to react. You may need to think about other properties of the distillate as well - for example, will much evaporate at room temperature and pressure?", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 3: Materials List"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Let's get to building it! The first step is shaping our distillation tube. If yours is metal, bending it should be straightforward - you won't have to worry about it bouncing back into its original shape. If you're using plastic that can be repositioned when heated like I am, you can use some binder clips and twist-ties to wrap it up the way you want and then put it into a pot of boiling water. Mine kept its new shape after about two minutes in the water. This step may not be absolutely necessary, but it certainly makes the tube easier to work with, and it's convenient to do if you were already hardboiling eggs anyway. (I don't know where the tube has been, so I was sure to cook the eggs before the tube.)Afterward, I found that it would have been better to have more unwound tube on the ends so that I would be less restrained when positioning everything.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F7L/VG8Q/I7D5WVJY/F7LVG8QI7D5WVJY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH2/Z1XL/I7D5WVJX/FH2Z1XLI7D5WVJX.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Prepare the Distillation Tube"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Next it's time to secure the tubes inside the condenser bath. I simply found bits that roughly matched my tubes' sizes and drilled holes where I wanted them. It's best to put the drainage tube in first since the distillation tube will be in the way otherwise... unfortunately, I didn't decide to add one until after I put in the distillation tube, but it still worked out find. Put the drainage tube somewhere low, since only water above the tube will be able to drain out. I wouldn't put it on the bottom, though, because that would be problematic when you want to set it down somewhere. I kept mine long enough that I could simply tuck it into the top when I'm not draining it.This was my first time working with caulk, so if you're new to it I encourage you to seek more experienced sources. All I can say is that you want to be sure you have a good seal on it; it's best to get both the inside and outside of the condenser. I used disposable gloves so I could push it into crevices manually and be sure it was well-sealed.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FPJ/TV3O/I7D5WVN1/FPJTV3OI7D5WVN1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F71/3JS3/I7D5WVQ1/F713JS3I7D5WVQ1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6Y/Y4GH/I7D5WVQ2/F6YY4GHI7D5WVQ2.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Start Adding the Tubes"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "You want the distillation tube to be in contact with the water which will later fill this container as much as possible, so if you used a flexible coil like me or something similar, try to situate it such that it's not bunched up but instead has some space between turns. Also consider the height of your distillation vessel - ideally you won't have to set your condenser on a pedestal to connect everything together. As the gas condenses back into a liquid, gravity will be responsible for pulling it down through the tube, so be sure you also have the tube going downward all the way, including the spout at the very end where the distillate will eventually exit.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 6: Add the Other Tube"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "When you're all done, what better to do then test it? The boiling temperatures of the components of your sample will determine the temperatures you need to work with, which in turn may influence your choice of heat source and condenser bath fluid. You'll need your heat to reach the boiling points and you'll need your condenser to be at a temperature lower than that - in each case, the greater the difference, the more quickly you can do things, although you should keep the temperature of the distillation vessel under control so you can boil off one fluid and then another rather than just boiling everything off. To get an idea of some common flame temperatures, see Wikipedia. For my purposes right now, a stove flame and tap water (with some ice to keep the temperature lower for a longer time) are perfectly sufficient.Retrospectively, I'd like to have given it a longer distillation tube so my condenser wouldn't be as close to the heat source as it is. I also would like to add a thermometer so I can infer what should be boiling and what should be mostly liquid from the temperature. In keeping with the made-from-scratch spirit of this project, I'd go for a barbecue or oven thermometer that can read temperatures up to 500\u00b0F.There's more to be done and I plan to build another with the insights I've gained from this first try. Nonetheless, it worked, for using a 9V battery and multimeter, I tested it the water's conductivity by measuring the current before and after distillation and found a decrease by a factor of ten!

I hope you enjoy! --Amateur chemistry can be educational, fun and rewarding; however, it can be intimidating to begin, especially with the cost of professional laboratory equipment. Fortunately, this is amateur chemistry, and we can use amateur equipment, a process which not only saves you money but also helps you to understand what's going on! In this Instructable I'll demonstrate how I built a distillation apparatus for only a few dollars.Distillation is useful for a wide range of hobbyists and makers - in addition to amateur chemists, their users include brewers, survivalists, herbalists, and more. Because I don't plan to use mine with flammable, solvating or volatile chemicals, I used scrap material and cheap parts that wouldn't be suitable for all purposes. Read on to get a feel for how things work.Friendly safety reminder: If you want to use this, be sure you check everything out first to make sure your application doesn't involve issues I didn't address in this Instructable. I listed what I thought of in the steps, but of course I couldn't have thought of everything. For each substance you plan to distill, be sure to check the specific safety cautions with those who have experience with it.", "title": "Enhanced Easy, Economical, Ecological Distillation - Apparatus 2.0", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Enhanced-Easy-Economical-Ecological-Distillation-A/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "You probably already know why you want to build a distillation apparatus. If not, I can certainly give you a few:The application common to all my fellow hobbyists and DIYers is purifying water, since we all use water numerous times daily. If you need to purify water and remove contaminants from it, you could do so by distillation. This might be done for drinking or use in a humidifier. (Before drinking, it's up to you to know your apparatus' capabiliites and limitations!)Home alcohol distillation probably is the first thing that comes to most of our minds. I'll say right now, though, that although this Instructable may give you ideas, it isn't suitable for alcohol. Alcohol is both flammable and a solvent, which I'll address in a later section. Furthermore, it may or not be legal depending on where you live. In the U.S., for example, distilling requires a federal license even if it's exclusively for personal use, and additional details vary by state. More importantly, alcohol is a drug that holds a wide array of risks and side effects.But why do I want to build a distillation apparatus? Amateur chemists often find commercial suppliers for reagents in everything from garden to automotive supply stores, and sometimes these finds require concentration, purification, or separation. In my case, I've been interested for a while in polymers and I'd love to make my own - I know of plastics made from borax and glue, milk (its protein casein), corn starch, agar, and gelatin. Ethylene glycol is readily available in antifreeze, but other chemicals are also present - I want to isolate ethylene glycol because of its dual hydroxyl groups, which I'm hoping will be useful in polymerization.I mentioned before that herbalists might use distillation because essential oils can be distilled to concentrate them. As with brewing, I'm not involved with any of the details of essential oils, so it's your responsibility to double-check safety and legality here. I can say right away, though, that essential oils are flammable, volatile (i.e. they tend to vaporize even when not heated) and have biological effects.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: Motivation"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "To start, we need to think about how distillation works. In short, we're using the facts that different liquids will boil at different temperatures to separate liquids, or to separate them from dissolved solids. It's not quite that simple, but the approximation works well enough for our purposes - if the purity isn't high enough after one distillation, we can simply do it again. Anyway, once the distillate has evaporated and most of the other components of your mixture are left behind, it's forced through the distillate tube into the condenser, as that's the only path available. While there it is cooled by the condenser bath and returns to its liquid state, and gravity then pulls it down through the tube into a its new container, separate from the other solutes.In reality, each liquid is independently competing against its own gaseous phase. In a pot of water at room temperature, through Brownian motion molecules are constantly flying free from the liquid into the gaseous atmosphere, but just as many water molecules are diving back in. Overall, there is no change, and we say that the system is in dynamic equilibrium. However, if we put the pot of water on a lit stove, the additional thermal kinetic energy of the water molecules means more are able to break free. Eventually, enough are in the atmosphere that as many come back in as are let loose and we reach equilibrium again. We quantify this in terms of vapor pressure, which is the pressure a vapor exerts when in equilibrium with its condensed (usually liquid) state. The boiling point is simply when the vapor pressure reaches the pressure actually exerted by the surroundings (atmospheric pressure, unless the container is sealed). For that reason, above the boiling point equilibrium no longer involves any liquid - it would all be gaseous. Imagine we're trying to distill isopropyl alcohol (boiling at 180.7\u00b0F) and water (212\u00b0F) - at 180.7\u00b0F, when all the isopropyl alcohol has evaporated, much of the water should also have evaporated at equilibrium - see this Wikipedia page. We can work the system, however, by repeating the distillation process to continue removing about the same proportion of the remaining water. I'm not sure if there's any benefit to trying to work quickly before equilibrium is reached since you'll have less of both fluids in the gas phase, not just less of the one with the higher boiling point, but that may also help.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 2: Scientific Explanation"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "This is of course not an exhaustive list, but it gives you a good idea of some of the things you need to be aware of.Some chemicals involved in your particular application may weaken or eat away at parts of the apparatus. In general, it's good to be thinking of what sort of characteristics your fluid has. For example, is it acidic, or maybe a solvent? Plastic is a cheap and convenient material, and differents types of plastic will be affected by the fluids passed through them in different ways. It's not hard to find free solvent/plastic compatibility charts such as this one online.As I stated earlier, heating a liquid to vaporize it as is done in this apparatus won't separate the solution perfectly and you can always expect to have some contamination by other liquid. How much of a problem this is depends on your intended use.Depending on what materials you use, what chemicals you distill, and what temperatures you attain, contaminants may also leach from your apparatus. For example, many plastics are known to leach chemicals, and copper also is liable to leach.Even after being condensed, some distillates may have a tendency to evaporate if they're not properly contained. While in some cases this simply means you're losing some of the product, in others it could be worse. Some distillates can be hazardous to your health via inhalation. Others may be flammable, a risk which is amplified by our use of a heat source. If you're using a stovetop, propane torch, etc. this is especially important, but don't forget to watch out for other possible unintended ignition sources as well.Sometimes a bit of heat provides the necessary activation energy to initiate chemical reactions. If you're using chemicals for which this is a concern, you probably have enough knowledge or experience that you're already aware of the danger. Nonetheless, be sure you consider whether or not anything in the solution you wish to distill is reactive.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 3: Safety Considerations"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "As I usually do, I used whatever was available and would do the job. Below I list the parts and explian how they'll be used so you know how to make one with alternative parts.MaterialsSteel coffee can - This is the vessel that contains your solution you'd like to distill. It'll be heated directly, so I opted for steel; I needed to be able to drill through it and insert a nipple easily, so I chose a coffee can. Lid - The lid simply prevents the evaporated gas from escaping into the atmosphere, so I just found one that fit my can. This time, you don't want one with a hole.1/4\" nipple - This connects the can to the first segment of the condenser tube. If you find a condenser tube of a different size, then your nipple would need to be a different size to match. Only one end needs to fit the condenser tube; the other can be any size.1/4\" sink tubing - For the first part of the condenser tube, which will be attached to the heated distillation vessel and close to the heat source, I wanted something that I could be confident would stand up to the heat it would face. I'm fairly certain there's a plastic tube inside the steel braiding/covering/whatever-it's-called, but these things are made to transport hot water, so I wasn't worried about it melting. On account of the nut-like screw-on endings, its inner diameter is about half its outer diameter, which is important for the next segment.1/4\" tubing - This is the second segment of condenser tube. It will hold the small tube and the coolant, which will probably just be ice water. It needs to fit in the nut-like ending of the sink tube. The closer the fit, the better. Small flexible tube - Because this tube carries the distillate coming out from the sink tubing, it should fit into the smaller inner part of the  sink tube. Again, the tighter the fit, the better.1/4\" valve or spigot - This allows for easily controlled drainage of the coolant when it warms up and needs to be replaced.ToolsDrill bits - We need one size to make a hole in the can for the nipple and another that's the size of the small distillate tube.Caulk - The caulk will fill in gaps where connections are made with tubing, including where the nipple connects to the can, so it needs to be heat-resistant.Funnel - I only use a funnel to make filling the large tube with ice water easier.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 4: Materials and Tools"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Two problems were apparent in my last attempt - first, the tube began to droop and deform under the heat, and second, the tube's slope wasn't great enough for gravity to pull the condensed distillate out unless it was fairly full. The two-segment condenser is my solution to the first problem. As it stands, the first condenser tube (the sink tube) is only cooled by air, which could be improved with a simple heatsink from aluminum cans or foil or by simply wiping it with a cool wet cloth periodically. My main concern for this first tube, though, was just to put some distance between the plastic tubes and the heat source, and it does the job nicely.For the second problem, merely finding a taller condenser bath than the plastic nut jar  I used last time so I could give the distillate tube a steeper declination would mean I'd have a much larger apparatus. That could be somewhat inconvenient, and I had already had some trouble dealing with how everything must be positioned in my previous apparatus. As I thought about how to deal with this, I had a new idea: why not put one tube carrying the distillate inside another carrying the ice water?

Finally, make sure the balloon isn't on fire. \u00a0I have a sink near the test site where I can place the balloon into a water bath. \u00a0It might also be a good idea to place a bucket of water beneath the test site so that if the balloon does catch you could simply cut the string and allow it to fall into the water.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FO5/WGCM/GWAU6PT2/FO5WGCMGWAU6PT2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5F/ZK2N/GW89M34Q/F5FZK2NGW89M34Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7N/ZL9D/GW88U2TT/F7NZL9DGW88U2TT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTI/F5KB/GW88LATZ/FTIF5KBGW88LATZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Experiment Part 2...

An equal amount of water along with 10g of sodium hydroxide is added and the mixture boiled for an hour. This causes the diethylhexyl phthalate to hydrolyze into phthalic acid and 2-ethylhexanol. After the solution cools it will phase separate into an aqueous layer containing disodium phthalate and an organic layer containing the alcohols.\nRetaining just the aqueous layer, 25mL of 12 molar hydrochloric acid is added to precipitate the phthalic acid. Chilling may be necessary. The supernatant is discarded and the residue of wet phthalic acid is purified and converted into phthalic anhydride by heating it to 300 Celsius. First the water boils off and then the phthalic anhydride evaporates and condenses on the sides of the beaker. At this point a flask of cold water is placed over the beaker to allow the phthalic anhydride to deposit on it. Periodically the phthalic anhydride deposits are harvested until no more can be obtained.\n45mL of sulfuric acid along with 13g phthalic anhydride and 19g of sodium nitrate are stirred together with the temperature slowly ramped up to 110 celsius. Once the temperature is reached the reaction is held for one hour to nitrate the phthalic anhydride to 3-nitrophthalic anhydride. Heating is then removed and the mixture allowed to cool back to room temperature. The gelled mixture is then transferred into 150mL of ice-cold water and vigorously stirred until all the chunks are broken up and nitrogen dioxide gas is no longer produced. Then the mixture is allowed to settle overnight. Then it is vacuum filtered and washed with two 50mL portions of water and allowed to dry under the forced air stream.\n1g of the 3-nitrophthalic acid is combined with 616mg hydrazine sulfate (https://www.instructables.com/id/Make-Hydrazine-Sulfate-by-the-Hypochlorite-Ketazin/) and 1.4g sodium acetate trihydrate (https://www.instructables.com/id/Make-Hot-Ice-The-Complete-Guide/) and 1mL of water. The mixture is boiled with a heat gun until dry. Then 4mL of polyethylene glycol (dot 3 brake fluid) with a boiling point higher than 230 celsius is added. The mixture is heated to 220 Celsius for ten minutes.\nThe mixture is allowed to cool to below 80 Celsius and then transferred into a large beaker with 100mL of water. 10g sodium hydroxide and 13g sodium metabisulfite are dissolved into the mixture. 5g of torn aluminum foil is then jammed into the beaker and held down with a flask while another flask of cold water is placed on top. Vigorous hydrogen evolution and self-heating will occur as the aluminum foil reacts. The mixture is allowed to reflux until it stops on its own. Additional aluminum foil is added and the process repeated until the mixture has no further change in color.\nThe mixture is filtered and the residue washed with an additional 50mL of water. The filtrate is then separated from any floating organic products. In a separate container a solution of 200mL of water and 25g of sodium bisulfate is prepared. 100mL of acetone is added and the filtrate is directly added to the mixture with vigorous stirring. Stirring is continued until there is no further change in the consistency or volume of the slurry. The supernatant is decanted off and allowed to evaporate.\nThe cake of luminol is mixed with 100mL of water and thoroughly washed to remove any remaining salts.

These are not the only starting materials that could be used to synthesize a fatty acid mixture (FAM), and maybe these are not the best choice of materials either.\u00a0\nI got interested in FAM by reading this tutorialhttp://opensourcenano.net/projects/project1/\nwhich shows how to make fatty-acid coated magnetite nanoparticles, and I found it while while searching for recipes on how to make ferrofluid.\u00a0 The FAM made via the recipe linked above is made using ingredients you might find in your kitchen, like: olive oil, vinegar, and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) drain cleaner.\u00a0 A PDF copy of their paper is attached below.\nIn fact a kitchen themed method for making FAM is a better method in many ways.\u00a0 Vinegar is less acidic and thus safer to work with than HCl based toilet cleaner.\u00a0 That's the main advantage. Also the raw ingredients should be cheaper, given that they are more raw, i.e less processed.\u00a0 You could probably find oil, vinegar, and lye in a pre-industrial (or even a post-industrial) society.\u00a0 Also the kitchen method produces a valuable by-product: glycerol.\u00a0 These more natural ingredients probably smell better too.\nHowever for the purposes of this instructable, I am going to assume that I'm living in some sort of dystopian over-industrialized consumer society, where the only available ingredients are ones sold as products intended to be used for something else.\u00a0 Another interesting feature of this hypothetical dystopian consumer society is that not only does the television/government tell you what to buy, but they also dictate how you must use these products once you get them home.\u00a0 In many cases the appropriate use for a given consumer product is to literally flush it down the toilet.\u00a0 Then go out and buy some more! Ha!\nWhich leads me to the best part:\u00a0 This instructable may be a violation of Federal Law (in the Former US)\u00a0 provided it constitutes a use of The Works(r) brand toilet bowl cleaner in a manner inconsistent with its labeling.\u00a0 A screenshot of http://www.theworkscleans.com/toiletcleaner.html is attached as a picture, the 4th in the stack, complete with misspellings.\u00a0\n;-)\nSeriously though kids, the most dangerous part of this 'ible is probably not the danger of running afoul of\u00a0 the guys who wear jackets with three letters printed on the back.\u00a0\u00a0 Most of the danger in this 'ible comes from the fact that you're working with hydrochloric acid.\u00a0 The Works(r) brand toilet bowl cleaner is 20% HCl by weight, or about 6 mol HCl per liter.\u00a0 It's kinda nasty stuff.\u00a0 You definitely want to wear eye protection.\u00a0 And gloves too. \u00a0 You should also wear gloves and eye protection in the event of you using that Works(r) stuff to clean stubborn lime scale deposits in your toilet.\u00a0\u00a0 And that could happen too. You'll have some left over. \u00a0 The recipe presented in this 'ible only uses like one quarter, 200 ml of a 800 ml ,bottle of The Works(r), per 127 gram bar of Ivory(r) soap.\nFinal note of this intro: I am still kind of a noob on the subject of chemistry, especially with respect to lab work. My knowledge is incomplete, and my garage is not a professional laboratory, yet I believe that what I'm doing in this 'ible is reasonably safe. Some persons reading this 'ible may disagree with my assessment of risk, and I love reading comments that say what I am doing is unsafe, immoral, illegal, or that I'm just plain doing it wrong.

The key to drilling steel by hand with a 1/16\" bit (or with a drill press for that matter) is patience.  Drill at low speed, and apply very little force.  Use cutting oil if you have it.  If you drill too fast, or apply too much force, you can easily bend and break the bit.  A good indicator that you're drilling at the right speed is that you're getting nice long chips.  If you're seeing powdery chips, drill slower.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FUC/QCTE/INS198RJ/FUCQCTEINS198RJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNM/S094/INS1996M/FNMS094INS1996M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGI/NAJU/INS199EZ/FGINAJUINS199EZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFS/N0L0/INS199HB/FFSN0L0INS199HB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR8/K7UY/INS199N4/FR8K7UYINS199N4.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Creating a Simple Flame Pipe"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "A bit more plumbing is required to connect the hose to the effect.  The hose should have a 3/8\" male flare fitting.  Flare fittings are great because they're self-sealing and don't require any teflon.  We need a couple of adapters to attach this to our effect.  See the image for details.The gas in the effect is actually at atmospheric pressure, because it's venting through the holes, by design.  As such, teflon on the fittings isn't actually required.  But it's good practice to teflon wrap all your connections.  Tips for teflon wrapping the joints:Use plenty of tape, 3 - 4\" per connection.  It should wrap around a couple of times at least.Wrap the tape against the direction of rotation of the male part.  In other words, think about the direction you'll be rotating the male part to screw it in, and wrap the teflon in the opposite direction, so that when you're done wrapping the \"tail\" of the tape is pointing away from the direction of the rotation.  This will ensure that when you start screwing it in, the tape will tighten with the threads, instead of being loosened by them.Wrap the tape with about 1/8\" overlapping the end of the joint, and smooth it out with your fingers a bit before screwing in the joint.If you've done it properly, you can screw in the joints hand tight and not have an leaks.Once you're done assembling the effect, wrap it in steel wool, and tie it around with wire.  I've used single stranded copper wire, which I have lying around my electronics bench, but bailing wire works fine as well.

As I had removed this I had to come up with another way.   The best way to figure out which solder mounts will turn your smoke detector on and off is to do some testing.  Start with the test on/off switch.  Touch a wire to this and any part that the ionization chamber was connected to.  Does it turn on and off when you remove the wire?  If so, you can just use this as your switch.  Unfortunately mine didn\u2019t so I had to do some experimentation.2.       With a piece of wire, I connected different parts of the circuit board to see what would turn on and off the fire alarm.  Below is how I did mine but as I mentioned previously, you probably have a different one to me so experiment until you come up with a way.  It took me about 5 minutes to work out one and it isn\u2019t hard.  3.  So what I did was attach a wire from the solder mount of the test switch to one of the legs on the IC.  there was a hole in the circuit board where one of the legs from the IC was sticking out.  that was the one I soldered the wire to. 4.  Next I attached a wire to a solder point that the buzzer was solder to and another wire to a negative solder point.  when I touched these 2 together the buzzer would come on.  Now I had a way to turn it on and off5.       Actually, while experimenting I worked out a way to change the pitch of the alarm.

You need four electrodes.\nAs you will find out, the carbon rods are brittle and break easily. So treat them gently.The easy way (pics 1 through 6):\n\t\tTake a 4,5 Volt \"flat battery\" (see pic 1).\n\t\tWith a small saw, cut off the plastic cap (where the poles of the battery stick through) and remove it (Pic 2 and 3).\n\t\tInside the plasic case, you'll find three zinc-carbon cells. They're connected with copper wire. Cut the wires and pull out the three cells.\n\t\tWith a fretsaw, carefully saw loose the very top of the cells. See pic 4.\n\t\tYou can now gently pull out the carbon core from the zinc-carbon cell (pic 5). If you're not gently enough, the carbon rod can break. See pic 6.\n\t\tWith cutting pliers, remove the zinc rim around the plastic cap on the rod's tip. Leave the plastic cap on top of the rod.The less easy way (pics 6 through 8):\n\t\tTake a AA (or C or D) sized zinc-carbon battery\n\t\tWith cutting pliers, cut loose the metal directly below the plus-pole of the battery (pic 6).\n\t\tIn the pile-batteries, the core is stuck into the shell. You'll have to break away the core's surrounding with the cutting pliers (pics 7 and 8). Not so easy, but it can be done.\nRepeat this until you have four carbon electrodes.\nTest the electrodes. With crocodile clamps, connect one electrode to the plus-side of a battery, and an other electrode to the minus-side of the same battery. Put the electrodes in salted water, but don't let them touch each other. You should see bubbles forming against the electrodes: Hydrogen and oxygen!More about electrodes...\nWhen choosing material for electrodes, you cannot use any conducting material you want, unfortunately. The ideal material for this use is platinum, and platinum electrodes are commonly used in labs. BUT... platinum is a very rare and valuable metal, and a set of lab-quality platinum electrodes will set you back at least $80,-. On eBay platinum electrodes that can be mounted on skin are sold for about $5 a set, but I haven't figured out a way to use them in an electrolyte (that is, in the salted water around the electrodes in the jar).\nSecond best choice for electrodes is Graphite / carbon, which is cheap and commonly available. Pencil-leads work fine as electrodes, but the cores of zinc-carbon batteries are much better suited for the job (the are made to act as an electrode, unlike the pencil leads).\n        ", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FKC/NBC5/GI0TGFX6/FKCNBC5GI0TGFX6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0O/YDPQ/GI0TGFX7/F0OYDPQGI0TGFX7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZT/OGHQ/GI0TGFX8/FZTOGHQGI0TGFX8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1U/ZAKU/GI0TGFX4/F1UZAKUGI0TGFX4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSM/D8R1/GI0TJBH4/FSMD8R1GI0TJBH4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPH/8EHR/GI0TGFX3/FPH8EHRGI0TGFX3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4Q/1F0B/GI0TGFXD/F4Q1F0BGI0TGFXD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNL/32M3/GI0TGFXC/FNL32M3GI0TGFXC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYG/VZ72/GI0TGFXA/FYGVZ72GI0TGFXA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUZ/93TA/GI0TGFXB/FUZ93TAGI0TGFXB.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Make the Electrodes"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "\n          The jar's cap is the vital part of the Ballistic Bubble Machine.

Oxyhydrogen is a very volatile gas and can escape through the smallest of slits. Sealing the tube and electrodes (with silicone gel) is vital to the working of the Ballistic Bubble Machine.\nSee picture 1 for a close-up on the lid.Preparing the cap (pics 2, 3 and 4):\n\t\tLay out the holes for the electrodes and the tube.

These elements will form H2 and O2 molecules, which escape from the water in bubbles.\nThe funny thing is, that when the hydrogen and oxygen-bubbles are put together again, they won\u2019t re-unite into water-molecules all by themselves. They must be given a little \u2018push\u2019 to do that. When 'pushed' (for instance with a spark or a flame), oxygen and hydrogen will bond again as water-molecules, with a loud crack and some heat as a thank you.Rocket fuel\nThe heat that is produced when hydrogen and oxygen are combined to water, makes rockets launch. The large clouds that appear when rockets launch, are made of pure and plain water. The large tanks that are mounted under the space shuttle contain hydrogen and oxygen seperately.

The questions and answers below are a sort of cascade: The answer to the first question gives rise to another question, and so on...Q: Where does the crack come from, when the bubbles are lighted?A: What happens during the crack is an extermely fast reaction between one oxygen (O2) molecule and two hydrogen (H2) molecules. During this reaction, two water-molecules (H2O) and energy are formed. The energy that \u201cemerges\u201d during the reaction causes the crack you hear.\nIn shorthand, the reaction looks like this:\n1 O2 + 2H2 \u2192 2 H2O + energy\nIn a picture, it looks like pic numer 3.Q: Why is the reaction so extremely fast, then?A: The reaction can happen so fast, because in the gasbubbles there is exactly one oxygen molecule present for every two hydrogen-molecules. So after the reaction, there will be no oxygen or hydrogen left. Such a mixture of gasses is called a stoichiometric mixture. In dutch, it's called an \"explosive mixture\".Q: So where does this \"explosive mixture\" of hydrogen and oxygen come from?A:\u00a0The oxygen and hydrogen come from the water inside the jar. Water is a \"compound\" of two atoms hydrogen and one atom oxygen: H2O. In the jar, the water-molecules are decomposed into hydrogen and oxygen.

Usually these include a large amount of small diameter, flexible copper refrigerator tubing. While these stills can be quite effective, there is just something a little hokey about them. Especially the part where you run a large amount of expensive copper tubing through a bucket of standing water to cool the condensate. Then there's the issue of a high surface area on the interior of the tubing, which makes small volume distillations difficult to impossible. Plus they're bulky, unwieldy, and they look like a meth lab. I do have to give the authors of these projects some credit however, since DIY is typically about getting the job done, form follows function, etc etc. BUT... I say there is a better way. By using a small amount of 1/2\" and 3/4\" copper pipe, it is possible to build a lightweight, compact, collapsible, interchangeable, universal distillation apparatus for anything you could possibly hope to distill. The apparatus featured here is capable of efficient low to medium volume distillations and could in principle be scaled for use in high volume applications. It is constructed from relatively inexpensive parts which are available at any hardware store. UPDATE 10/27/2011: If you find the start-up costs for this project to be prohibitive, I recommend this instructable. I was inspired to build a distillation apparatus during an organic chemistry lab where we were required to identify an unknown organic solvent by IR spectroscopy. The samples they gave use weren't pure and we had to distill them first so the IR machine could get a good spectrum. This apparatus is modeled after the one I used in that lab. In the lab the apparatus was made of lab quality glassware. Since I don't know how to work with glass, and I DO have experience remodeling houses, I decided to combine my experiences to make an affordable, clean, safe, glass alternative distillation apparatus. So. Now I've got your attention.

I really hate this part. Can't I just ask you guys to be smart and leave it at that? Ok, here we go! SAFETY: This project requires the use of tools and equipment that may be HAZARDOUS if handled improperly. Soldering of copper pipe requires the use of an open propane flame that can cause severe burns and fires. Never point a propane jet at anyone or leave one unattended for any period of time. HOT metal looks like COLD metal. Distillation is a method of separating liquids that are in solution together, often as a form of purification. However, only proper, professional testing can positively identify the constituents of a given distillate. If you are purifying comestibles, DRINK AT YOUR OWN RISK. UPDATE 10/27/2011: DO NOT use lead solder. DO NOT use this to distill hydrogen peroxide or any other potentially explosive chemical. DO NOT allow blockages to form in the distillation pot outlets. DO NOT use radioactive materials as fractionating column filler. RESEARCH aluminum and decide for yourself whether it poses any danger. LEGALITY: In my own backwards country where the vestiges of prohibition are still rampant, it's illegal to manufacture certain distillates without a permit for the still in question. We'll just leave it at that. I don't think it's a problem to distill anything else, but I haven't checked so don't take my word for it. If you're in a country that allows it, then I highly suggest the HomeDistiller where you will find the finer points of ethanol production described in beautiful detail. The same principles apply to ethanol used for fuel, but as mentioned in the comments section, a still must still be registered to distill fuel. Still. UPDATE 10/28/2011: Please visit TTBgov for more information about US law regarding the use of a distillation apparatus. Basically, they make it impossible for a regular person to distill liquor. Producing fuel ethanol is somewhat do-able. All other distillations are ok.

ISBN 978-1429219563.Imagine you have a big stack of differently colored marbles. For whatever reason, you want to sort your marbles into different piles based on their color. So you begin to go though and pick out the colors one by one. If you have a small number of marbles this won't take long. But now imagine your marbles are about a billionth of a meter in diameter and there are so many of them it would make Avogadro, er, I mean your head spin. Well, it wouldn't be very practical to go through with a very small tweezers, picking out all the marbles that are the same color. Indeed, color loses its meaning at those scales anyway. So we have to use some other method to sort them, hopefully a method that doesn't involve much manual sorting. I'll return to the realm of not insulting your intelligence now. Distillation is a method of separating two or more liquids by taking advantage of their differences in vapor pressure. Vapor pressure is the pressure exerted by the gas above a compound. All compounds have vapor pressure, even solids. Granted, the vapor pressure of steel is much less than that of, say, water. Given this fact, it would be fairly easy to separate water from steel, yes? Vapor pressure is exerted by ice. This means ice can evaporate, and in fact this is what causes freezer burn. But what if we have two liquids that have relatively similar vapor pressures (but still different) and we can't just use some sort of filter to separate them? Let's say we have two liquids A and B. A and B have a vapor pressure at room temperature of 22Torr and 40Torr, respectively (Torr is a unit of pressure). Let's say we have exactly the same amounts of A and B in a container. This means that the composition of the liquid is 50%A and 50%B, but the vapor ABOVE the liquid has a composition of 22/(22+40)=35%A and 40/(22+40)=65%B. There is significantly more of compound B than compound A in the vapor! By the way, this is probably a horrendous oversimplification of the proportions, and I COULD flip though my O-chem book to find the correct relation, but I'm sure you get the general idea. Now, if we can collect this vapor and turn it into a liquid, we would have a liquid of composition 35%A and 65%B. We would be one step closer to separating our compounds. In fact, we CAN collect the vapor and turn it into a liquid by cooling the vapor down so that it condenses. And as luck would have it, as we remove vapor, it is replenished constantly by the liquid below. Unfortunately, this process will be EXTREMELY slow because the vapor pressures are so low and very little vapor can escape from the liquid in the container in a given amount of time. It could take days or weeks to separate them. If only there was a way to raise the vapor pressure... Well there is. And we do that by adding energy, in the form of heat, to the system. By adding heat, we can raise the total vapor pressure within the container to exactly 760Torr, but no further. This is because 760Torr is the pressure of the Earth's atmosphere, and it is at this point that the liquid in the container begins to boil. Now we can collect the vapor above the liquid and it will be replenished VERY quickly. The boiling will actually push the vapor out of the container, and as long as we channel the vapor through something cold, thereby reducing the vapor pressure once again, we can condense it and collect it as a liquid with a high concentration of compound B. This is what a distillation apparatus does, and one distillation step is referred to as a \"simple distillation\". A mixture of liquids is placed in a pot that is heated to boiling. The temperature of the vapor is measured by a thermometer at the top of a vapor column, as an indication of relative purity. Condensate (distillate) is usually collected over a certain temperature range, which is indicative of the purity of the result. The vapor travels through a condenser that cools the vapor, returning it to a liquid state that is a different composition from the starting liquid. If we do this over and over again, we'll eventually get a liquid that is nearly pure B, and almost no A. Note that purification actually takes many repetitions of distillation. Well, that's kind of a pain. What if we want to completely purify something very quickly? That's where fractional distillation comes in. A fractional distillation column is a device wherein MANY distillations occur in ONE step. The fractional column is a long tube that is packed with a material high in surface area but low in volume. Glass beads, chambers separated by plates, and various shredded materials work well as packing. As vapor travels up the column, a temperature gradient is created (higher temp on bottom, lower temp on top). This causes vapor to condense on the packing as it rises. The condensed material is higher in purity than the starting material. Then more vapor travels up the column, heating this condensed liquid to its new boiling point and vaporizing it, with the vapor being one step higher in purity than the last step. As the composition skews further toward B, the boiling point drops, reinforcing the temperature gradient as the material travels up the column. This occurs many times as vapor travels up the column, with the lower vapor pressure liquid separating out and dripping back down the column and flowing back to the original container. Fractional columns are often referred to as reflux tubes for this reason. The use of a perfect fractionating column would result in very sharp jumps in temperature readout on the thermometer. As each pure compound is exhausted in the container and the next lowest boiling compound climbs the column, the temperature will rise quickly, indicating the change in compound. Performing a distillation using a fractional column is referred to as \"fractional distillation\" and results in a highly purified liquid. This project allows for the use of both types of distillation, since many raw products to be distilled contain organic solids that can contaminate the packing of a fractional column, and MUST be simply distilled first to remove these impurities.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FRV/KL6C/GU2F3TJC/FRVKL6CGU2F3TJC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKU/SFZF/GU2QYP2C/FKUSFZFGU2QYP2C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWZ/4X9C/GU1UZ2SP/FWZ4X9CGU1UZ2SP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFI/S1V8/GU1I4IRG/FFIS1V8GU1I4IRG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZM/33BC/GU2F3THP/FZM33BCGU2F3THP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Distillation Theory."}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": " First of all, an apology: I really despise the British Imperial system of measurement.

You have a pile of raw materials sitting in front of you, patiently waiting for you to turn them into something amazing. Get to it. Cut the pipe to length.

One 12\" long 3/4\" pipe. You need to put a slight bend at one end of the 18\" long 1/2\" pipe. This is tricky, and it's what the 1/2\" couplings are for. Use the metal file to file away the pipe stops on the inside of one of the couplings so it can slide freely over the 1/2\" pipe. Place the slide coupling about 3\" from the end of the pipe. Place the other coupling on the end of the pipe. Now find some way of bending the pipe gradually WITHOUT KINKING IT. This is hard to do. Kinking it will result in liquid build-up behind this raised section. It's not the end of the world, but it represents a loss of distillate, which is bad for efficiency. Denting the pipe first with a brass hammer where you want it to bend helps. The couplings help prevent the circular diameter from distorting at those points so you won't have problems joining things to those points later. Alternatively, you could use the easily bendable 1/2\" pipe that comes in rolls that is made from soft copper, but this may make the whole apparatus weaker in the end. Using the file again, file away the stops on the 3/4\"x1/2\" adapter so it can slide freely over the 1/2\" pipe. Using the drill, drill two holes in the 3/4\" pipe section, 1\" from each end, on the same side of the pipe. The 1/4\" refer tube needs to fit into this hole snugly.

If you've done your prep work properly, this step is easily the most fun. If you've never soldered copper before, I suggest starting with the columns that will end up vertical, since these don't involve non-standard joints. Use the joint brushes to thoroughly clean the areas to be joined. The copper should be bright and lustrous before you solder. Use the flux brush to apply flux to all surfaces you want to bind together with solder. This means the inside of the fitting AND the outside of the pipe. Then place the pipe inside the fitting, make sure it goes in all the way. Place the part in a vice (wrap it in a towel to avoid marking the beautiful copper) or on the edge of a table. Remember, this copper is about to get VERY HOT. I've found that trying to flux and solder joints that are far from each other in one soldering run is a bad idea. When flux is heated and not soldered it loses is flux-iness. The joint will need to be re-fluxed or the solder won't flow correctly. If joints are literally right next to each other this isn't a problem. Fire up the torch and adjust the knob so that the bright blue cone of flame within the outer flame is about an inch long. Touch the tip of this inner flame to the joint, preferably near the lower surface (heat rises). Touch the solder to the OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE JOINT from the flame. The ENTIRE JOINT must be hot enough to melt the solder for the solder to flow, so this prevents making a bad joint. Slowly melt the solder into the joint until one drop of solder falls from beneath the joint. This ensures you have placed enough solder. If you want a clean-looking joint (no solder blobs), quickly (before the solder solidifies) brush the exterior of the joint with the flux brush AWAY FROM YOUR FACE.

I think it would be best for you to examine the pictures and figure this out for yourself. Most connections are self-explanatory, with a few exceptions. The condenser is the most complicated bit. The 18\" long 1/2\" pipe resides on the INSIDE of the 3/4\" pipe. The 1/2\" pipe is one continuous piece with the 3/4\" pipe sheathed around it concentrically and held in place by the 3/4\"x1/2\" adapters. There is very little space between the two pipe walls by design. It is ESSENTIAL that water be able to easily flow through this outer space between the two pipe walls. This outer sheath of flowing cooling fluid is what allows the whole apparatus to be so compact. Problems arise in assembly because the water is introduced to the chamber by the 1/4\" copper tubes. If the 1/4\" drilling burr or the 1/4\" tube itself protrude too far into the chamber, it will restrict the flow of cooling water by contacting the outer surface of the 1/2\" pipe. Use the file to reduce the size of the burr (you want a little bit there to help the soldering process) and make sure when you solder the tube in place it is just barely going past the inside wall of the 3/4\" pipe. Solder the 1/4\" tubes in place FIRST so you can see what you're doing. Then clean (with sandpaper on the 1/2\" pipe), flux and solder the two joints made by the 3/4\"x1/2\" adapter NEAREST to the the bend in the 1/2\" pipe. Fit the other adapter onto the opposite end but do not flux it. The second adapter is just there to keep the pipes aligned for now. ALIGN the 1/4\" tubes so that they will point UP (in-line and away from the 1/2\" bend). Solder the joints near the bend in the 1/2\" pipe. The 3/4\" and 1/2\" pipes are now bound concentrically by one soldered adapter. Now flux and solder the second adapter. When the assembly cools, make sure the cooling chamber is sealed except for the 1/4\" tubes by blocking one with your finger and trying to suck air out of the other. Then try to blow air though the chamber. If you've got a good seal and good air flow then congratulations, the rest of this is a piece of cake!

I had to remove the nub first so I could center the drill in the resulting hole. Then I tried to solder the back end of the female adapter to the top of the pressure cooker. Apparently copper solder doesn't like to bond to aluminum. I thought about making some kind of escutcheon that I could solder to the female adapter on the inside of the pressure cooker. I gave up on that idea. I tried to use a big metal spike and a hammer to widen the back of the female adapter and that didn't work, I just ended up with a big spike stuck in there. Then I got frustrated so I beat the crap out of the female adapter with a big mallet and it flattened it. That gave me an idea. I got a new female adapter and put it though the hole in the lid (threads facing the outside of the lid) and rested the threaded end of the adapter on the anvil of my vice. Then I placed the ball end of a ball pean hammer on the soldering part of the adapter. Then I beat the ball pean hammer with the big mallet. This deformed the back end of the adapter so it had a lip.

Say you have a mixture of compounds A, B and C, and you want only B. Look up boiling points for all three compounds. Lets say they are 65C, 78C, and 100C. After performing a simple distillation over the entire range and collecting distillate from 65C to 100C, do a fractional distillation. If there is much of compound A, the temperature readout will rise until it hits 65C, where it will plateau. Discard distillate that is produced at this temperature, it's almost pure A. When A has been exhausted, the temp will rise until it gets to 78C where it will plateau again. Collect distillate from range B. This distillate is almost pure B. Then discard from range C.

In this case it will split water into hydrogen and oxygen gas. A dry cell electrolyser is an electrolyser that is completely enclosed; the other type is a wet cell electrolyser which can be two metal plates in a bowl of water. The equipment is fairly simple but the theory behind it is a bit more complicated, if you\u2019re not interested in the theory then skip to step 1. Here\u2019s the theory: the electrolyser uses the different ionic charge on the different atoms in the molecule to split it into its respective charged atoms or molecules, for example, water gets split into Hydrogen and Oxygen because in the water molecule the hydrogen is slightly positively charged and the oxygen is slightly negatively charged. These charges are only very slight, +1 electron volt (ev) for each hydrogen and -2 ev on each oxygen atom. Just for comparison 1 electron volt is 1.6\u00d710\u221219 Coulombs (c) and 1 Coulomb is the charge transported by a steady current of one ampere in one second. The hydrogen is attracted to the negatively charged electrode or Cathode and the oxygen is attracted to the positively charged electrodes or Anodes. At the anodes the oxygen ions loose an electron and bond to form oxygen gas, at the cathodes the hydrogen ions get an electron from the cathode and then bond to form hydrogen gas. This transfer of electrons from and to the electrodes completes the circuit and allows current to flow. A catalyst can be used to make the process more efficient by reducing the energy needed to start the process; the catalyst that I use is sodiumhydroxide in a 1 to 40 mix with deionized water. The water doesn\u2019t need to be deionized but it extends the lifetime of the unit as minerals and other stuff won\u2019t build up on the electrodes.", "title": "Dry Cell Electrolyser", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Dry-Cell-Electrolyser/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The PDF shows the parts of the electrolyser and how they're assembled, however\u00a0I\u00a0will go into this in more detail later.\nThere are several parts and a few tools that you will need.\n10mm polycarbonate\n8mm id 12mm od rubber tubing\n3mm rubber gasket material\n180cm M8 studding\n18x M8 dome nuts\n18x M8 nilock nuts\n4x 1/4in BSP aluminium washers\n2x 1/4in BSP male to male adapter\n2x 1/4in BSP male to 1/8in BSP female adapter\n2x 1/8in BSP to 8mm tube connector\n2x 1/4in BSP 2 way ball valve\n12AWG wire\n17x M7 ring terminal\n15x Flag crimps\nLoctite pipe\u00a0sealant or equivalent\u00a0\u00a0\n13mm spanners\nDrill\nCrimp tool\nWire cutters\nWire strippers\nJig saw\nPermanent marker\nMetal ruler\nSharp knife", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8Q/3G0B/H5TUAYPG/F8Q3G0BH5TUAYPG.LARGE.jpg", "/assets/img/pixel.png"], "step_title": "Step 1: Parts and Tools"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "I\u00a0made the end walls out of polycarbonate as\u00a0I\u00a0had some laying\u00a0around\u00a0and it is a strong\u00a0material\u00a0that is\u00a0actually\u00a0used to make blast and bullet proof screens.\u00a0I\u00a0designed the end\u00a0plates\u00a0according\u00a0to the amount of polycarbonate that\u00a0I\u00a0had but there\u00a0inst\u00a0really\u00a0any limits, the end walls are 240X200mm.

The neutralized filtrate can be disposed of as you would any simple salt solution. Procedures may vary from location to location.\r\nNice Reading While Doing this Experiment-\r\nWhile reading a text book of chemistry, I came upon the statement, \"nitric acid acts upon copper.\" I was getting tired of reading such absurd stuff and I determined to see what this meant. Copper was more or less familiar to me, for copper cents were then in use. I had seen a bottle marked \"nitric acid\" on a table in the doctors office where I was then 'doing time'! I did not know its peculiarities, but I was getting on and likely to learn. The spirit of adventure was upon me. Having nitric acid and copper, I had only to learn what the words \"act upon\" meant. Then the statement \"nitric acid acts upon copper\", would be something more than mere words. All was still. In the interest of knowledge I was even willing to sacrifice one of the few copper cents then in my possession. I put one of them on the table; opened the bottle marked \"nitric acid\"; poured some of the liquid on the copper; and prepared to make an observation. But what was this wonderful thing which I beheld? The cent was already changed, and it was no small change either. A greenish blue liquid foamed and fumed over the cent and over the table. The air in the neighborhood of the performance became colored dark red. A great cloud arose: This was disagreeable and suffocating--how should I stop this? I tried to get rid of the objectionable mess by picking it up and throwing it out the window, which I had meanwhile opened. I learned another fact--nitric acid not only acts upon copper but it acts upon fingers. The pain led to another unpremeditated experiment. I drew my fingers across my trousers and another fact was discovered. Nitric acid acts upon trousers. Taking everything into consideration, that was the most impressive experiment, and, relatively, probably the most costly experiment I have ever performed. I tell of it even now with interest. It was a revelation to me. It resulted in a desire on my part to learn more about that remarkable kind of action. Plainly the only way to learn about it was to see its results, to experiment, to work in a laboratory.\r\n-- Ira Remsen (1846-1927)\r\nThe Chemistry...\r\nOxidation of copper metal with a strong oxidizing agent, conc. nitric acid.\r\nIn a classic experiment, copper metal is turned into copper(II) ion while the nitrogen(V) in the nitrate ion becomes nitrogen(IV) in the nitrogen dioxide gas.\r\nCharles' Law\r\nAs the temperature from the reaction warms the gas, it expands. Later, as it cools, the gas contracts.\r\nNonmetal oxides are acid anhydrides (also link to acid rain)\r\nAlthough the nitrogen dioxide gas is noxious and toxic, it dissolves readily in water and make the solution acidic. This can be shown by adding a little indicator to the water and making the water slightly basic before the copper is added to the acid.\r\nAir pressure\r\nAs the pressure in the flask is decreased as it cools, the outside pressure pushes the water up the tubing toward the flask. The nitrogen dioxide gas is not pulling the water in.\r\nDescriptive chemistry--copper solutions are green and blue\r\nThe colored solutions come from complexes of copper(II) ion in solution. Aqueous copper ion is blue, Cu(H2O)42+ The green must be copper surrounded by nitrates.\r\nReference-http://www.chemmybear.com/demo.htm", "title": "Demonstrating Nitric Acid Acts Upon a Copper Penny Experiment", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Nitric-Acid-Acts-Upon-A-Copper-Penny-Experiment/", "section": "technology", "steps": [], "channel": "Science"}, {"category": "technology", "description": "It has been moved to http://www.youtube.com/CforChemistryHD", "title": "\"Negative X\" How to Make Fire With Water (Zinc, Ammonium Nitrate and Sodium Chloride)", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/quotNegative-Xquot-How-to-make-fire-with-water/", "section": "technology", "steps": [], "channel": "Science"}, {"category": "technology", "description": "The demonstrations of many remarkable experiments include a high safety risk (e.g. the reaction of large pieces of sodium/potassium with water; the reaction of potassium with liquid bromine; the reaction of sodium with concentrated sulfuric acid, etc.).

Knead or swish them in the water for 30 seconds each and ensure that any stains are removed by rubbing. Once finished trace out any patterns with a pencil or knife to ensure that they do not shrink into themselves e.g knitted stiches on a sweater.B.By machineUse eco setting. Always place a decent amount of clothes when you use eco because it uses less water. For example put 3/4 of your normal load and 3/4 of soap compared to your normal just to be safe.

If you forgot to iron out a wrinkled shirt, spray some water with a water bottle with a hole made with a pin in its cap. Spray the cloth lightly and hang it on a hanger after stretching it out.F. Removing Lint. You can either 1. Use your normal lint roller2. Put tape backwards around your roller if its adhesive has come off then remove and throw the tape when done.3. make a permanent one by getting a cylindrical object rolling the tape backwards around it and using that.

Buckminster Fuller\nAloha Yall\nOK. I know you came here to find out my recipe for an extremely (almost free) cheap, easily constructed by joe average fuel saving and emission reduction device that will cut your fuel bill by a huuge amount AND almost eliminate smoke WHILE cleaning your engine components.\u00a0 And you will. In abit.\u00a0\nFirst though, I wish the story to be known. Well ok, my story.\u00a0 If you don't feel like reading this right now, I understand, though I hope you will get curious later.\u00a0 You can get the recipe at\nQuit your yakking and just gimme da\u00a0 #$$%^! recipe. (link recipe)\nThe reason behind this technology and the way I choose to make it massively and easily available is that it has the potential to actually make a difference in air quality worldwide.\u00a0 The use of oil though, notwithstanding the increase in fuel efficiency due to this device, I don't anticipate will decrease. People will simply drive more or blow more leaves.. Remember when we all thought computers making us more efficient will reduce our work? Turns out we just used the freed up time to work more.\u00a0 Like that.\u00a0\nNo, I anticipate the major impact will be a tangible and almost instantaneous improvement of your local air.\u00a0 I mean your local local air like your garage when you warm up the car; the truckpark at your diner; the bus station; the ferry; your construction site; your leafblower (admit it, you have one of these mega air polluters). This is the way I hope it will happen. Some people will notice the results of them and their network implementing an actual proactive act of enviromental remediation by making and installing an emission control and fuel efficiency device in their engines.\u00a0 Perhaps this might, I hope, lead to a change in thinking viz. A) I can actually make a difference (not just claim to be a currently trendy \"green\") B) It is good economics (in your wallet, not on some TV ecopundits's chalk board).\u00a0\u00a0 A massive rethinking on an all planet over local level is needed to change things. That is my goal behind my passing on the info.\u00a0 Maybe people can feel some hope again amid the gloomy outlook being shilled by mass media. Maybe even revival of the idealism and zeal we once had when we were young? (I am referring to my own age group of B/IPPIES (Boomers/ex hippies) and our tarnished hopes here).\u00a0 This is my own motivation.\u00a0 Goes to show you can take the hippie out of the commune but you take the commune(ity) out of the hippie.\u00a0 Some of us simply refuse to cut our hair (even if it is getting a bit thin :-)\nI do get a selfish (sorta)\u00a0 and beautiful benefit doing this.\u00a0 You know how you feel when you help someone or do a good deed?\u00a0 I hope you remember anyway.\u00a0 yeah you do. Otherwise you wouldn't be reading this, heheheh.\u00a0 For me I always got off on coaching Little League.\u00a0 The feeling I get when I do, is, for me, right up there in the\u00a0 feelings leaderboard.\u00a0 This I have figured out lately (from energy cultivation studies-see below) is because FEELINGS ARE REAL AS GRAVITY.\u00a0 Now it don't take much of a genius to figure that the cadillac of feelings is Love.\u00a0 The rest is merely static.\u00a0 It is so simple to me now.\u00a0 I feel great when I coach kids because they love me!!\u00a0 Kids are pure and innocent and their love is pure and innocent and static free.\u00a0 We feel this most easily and acutely. I know I am not wrong when I say - Everybody knows this (yadayadayada rational mind schrational mind...).\u00a0 Oh some of us (too many) go through some period where we let life kick us around so much we think this is not true. Rerealize the truth. Please.\nMy mentors taught me that if I generate useful new information, Universe will bestow benefits and blessings tenfold upon me.\u00a0 This is always been true and remains so.\u00a0 There are many people who follow this credo and I admire them as a class.\u00a0 I wanted to continue to do this.\u00a0 I still have many ideas and developed projects in the works as I enjoy Designing (in the Bucky Fuller definition) and I wanted to get them out there.\u00a0 The real world business bit has never been a pleasure for me. So I decided to just give the designs away.\u00a0 No strings attached. Go for it. Run with it. Make it . Use it. Give it. Sell it. Tell it. Spread it. Link it. Translate it. Mirror it. Facebook it. Google it.\u00a0 Just please mention the E.L.V.I.S. site (as a way of furthering the distribution).\nI want many millions\u00a0 to use this information, build this device, reduce personal air pollution, save lotsa dough, make a business, rekindle hope, feel enpowered, feel just plain good to do something.\u00a0 I want the most love vibes possible.\u00a0 I want to feel, in my deepest soul body the cascade of resplendence. And get wiped out in the laughing tumble cycle of the goodvibes tsunami already approaching. I trust Universe to bestow appropriate blessings upon me.\u00a0 :-D\nI give you the Electrochemical Liquid Vortexing Ionization System.\u00a0\u00a0 E.L.V.I.S.\u00a0\u00a0 Hey I think its cute and memorable while paying due respects to The King.\u00a0 Its actually TM in the Philippines where I currently live on a small island with my family cultivating bamboo, organic food and reefs.\nE.L.V.I.S.\u00a0 TM\nElectrochemical Liquid Vortex Ionization System.\nAn inline catalytic device that electrochemically charges fuel to enhance\u00a0 dispersion through self repulsion resulting in more complete combustion. E.L.V.I.S. reduces soot; dissolves deposits; increases horsepower; cleans emissions and improves fuel economy. E.L.V.I.S. makes your old engine rock like new.\nThe Science\nCertain metals, under special environments can be persuaded to donate electrons (negatively charged subatomic virtual particles). These free electrons will attach themselves to molecules of any conductive fluid or gas with which they are in contact.\u00a0 This causes these molecules to become cationic (acquire a negative electrical charge).\u00a0 Since like charges repel, when this fluid (say hydrocarbon fuel) is atomized into a spray, this tendency results in a more finely and widely dispersed cloud.This allows more contact with oxygen molecules and increases the efficiency of combustion. This increases the total amount of heat energy (BTUs) available,\u00a0 preventing\u00a0 soot (unburned fuel) formation as well as consuming any previous soot.\u00a0 This translates immediately to more clean horsepower from less fuel.\nThese principles of electrochemistry (over a century old) have been applied in devices both common, (ex. batteries), and classified (ex. rocket engines). Jet Propulsion Lab's 1984 report for NASA -\u00a0 NPO 15715 - REDUCING SOOT IN DIESEL ENGINES - on the effect of charged fuel on soot reduction concluded that charged fuel produced less soot during combustion.\u00a0 Their 1998 report, NASA - NPO 20219 - ELECTROSTATIC DISPERSION OF FUEL DROPS TO REDUCE SOOT - comparing electrostatic ionization vs. atomization of fuel concluded - \"Electrostatic charging is superior to mechanical centrifugation for combined soot nucleation reduction and enhancement of evaporation\"\u00a0\u00a0\nExclusive to E.L.V.I.S., the outbound fuel stream is spun into a high speed vortex that braids the liquid inwardly into a higher energy imploded state. When released by the fuel pump this pent up energy causes an extra outward impetus to the fuel molecules in addition to the self repelling effects of like charges.\nElectrostatic fuel ionization technology has been extensively tested and is currently being used by corporations, government agencies and military forces all over the world.\u00a0 Affordable consumer level devices using this principle have not been widely available until the E.L.V.I.S.\nFor all the details go to\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 www.the-elvis.info", "title": "DIY Fuel Ionizer for Real Cheap.

This small ionizing (-) charge primarily effects the fuel stream at the point of atomization (dropletting) at the fuel injector nozzle. An uncharged fuel droplet within the vapor cloud in the combustion chamber tends to clump together creating larger droplets with less surface area of fuel exposed to oxygenation at the instant of combustion. The negatively charged fuel droplets within the vapor cloud will now repel each other causing smaller droplet diameters and a finer mist. That finer mist burns at statistically higher temperatures than a non-ionized fuel stream and significantly improves combustion efficiency resulting in less unburned fuel, soot, smoke and particulate. Reductions in carbon and nitrous based gases are also demonstrated.The efficiency of fuel ionization was demonstrated at NASA-JPL by Bellan and Harstad in 1984 and 1998Electrostatic Dispersion of Fuel Drops To Reduce Soot A numerical simulation shows that electrostatic dispersion is superior to mechanical dispersion. - JPL Labs, Pasadena, CaliforniaElectrostatic dispersion of drops of sprayed liquid fuel has been proposed as a technique for reducing the amount of soot formed during burning of the fuel. It is necessary to disperse fuel drops in order to reduce local concentrations of fuel-rich vapors, because such concentrations favor the nucleation of soot. The present technique can be implemented by use of a previously developed device called an \u201celectrostatic triode\u201d; this device puts like electrostatic charges onto sprayed fuel drops to generate dispersion of the drops. Another technique for reducing the formation of soot is mechanical dispersion through utilization of turbulence. The effectiveness of electrostatic versus mechanical dispersion for reducing the formation of soot has been investigated in a theoretical and computational study.In the study, the mechanical and thermodynamic interactions between fuel drops and the surrounding gases were simulated numerically by use of a mathematical model similar to the models used in previous studies of sprayed liquid fuels that have been performed by the same innovators and summarized in a number of articles in NASA Tech Briefs. The model includes, among other conservation equations, equations for the momenta of the drops. The electrostatic forces were included in these equations for those drops that were considered to be charged. The calculations for the charged drops were stopped at the Rayleigh limit; that is, secondary atomization was not modeled. The results of the numerical simulations were interpreted as signifying that electrostatic dispersion would be superi- or to mechanical dispersion for reducing the nucleation of soot; this finding gave rise to speculation that perhaps a combination of electrostatic and mechanical dispersion might be even more effective. However, further numerical simulation revealed that for the purpose of reducing the formation of soot, the combination electrostatic and mechanical dispersion would not offer a significant advantage over electrostatic dispersion alone. This work was done by Josette Bellan and Kenneth Harstad of Caltech for NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. NPO-20219 \" ...

The screens are preferably made of such materials as 304 stainless steel and copper, and are placed in a cylindrical housing that is preferably made from copper and nickel. The copper and nickel housing is so described because its principal alloy components are those metals, but the actual metallurgical constituency is generally set forth hereinafter. The knitted mesh spiral coiled wire stands, are compacted and composed of various metals, base metals and metal alloys as more specifically set forth hereinafter.cu and al.In another embodiment, a method of creating an electric field for fuel treatment is accomplished by directing the fuel stream, between two dissimilar, short-circuited metals such as copper and aluminum. The electric field effect occurs due to the existence of standard potential differences between metals. The fuel flows between the two metals such as copper and aluminum and is treated by the electric field created by the potential difference of the metal pair. The desirable thin fuel stream and associated high field treatment within the fuel line could also be located and created within the inlet section of the fuel injector body itself. \ufffdTEST\u00a0RESULTSThere is no shortage of data to support the effectiveness of bimetallic ionization in dispersal of fuel particles. The following data is from informal tests using my 15 year old Honda gas scooter and 9 yr old KIA diesel jeep. Each has been on the E.L.V.I.S. since 2006 so we expect there to be cumulative cleaning effects of ionization. This is borne out by their baseline ( E.L.V.I.S. removed) readings which are above norm by about 100%, a result consideredby the inspector as unprecedented even in new engines. When the E.L.V.I.S. was reinstalled for the test, a further significant effect on hydrocarbon content (HC), ie smoke was noted; Carbon monoxide (CO) were also hugely reduced.

INCREASE HORSEPOWER.Yes. As much as 1% has been reported on racing motorcyle engines using ionization technologyHOW DOES THE E.L.V.I.S. PROTECT MY ENGINE AND PROLONG ENGINE LIFE?Soot (unburned fuel) is trapped in the crankcase resulting in oil contamination and breakdown. Soot is also responsible for carbondeposits. Hotter, more efficient combustion reduces soot and its detrimental effects on engine oil. Ionized fuel is repelled by the grounded cylinder walls resulting in no new, and gradual dissolution of previous deposits. Your wear and tear is reduced because your oil works more effectively for longer. Your interval between maintenance and overhauls is enormously prolonged. Your engine runs better, cleaner longer.WHAT ENGINES DOES THE E.L.V.I.S. WORK ON?Gasoline, diesel, 4 stroke, 2 stroke. WHAT FUEL SAVINGS RESULTS CAN I EXPECT?Really depends. Fuel savings from industry and government fuel ionization studies show results from 2% to 40%. HOW SOON WILL I SEE OR FEEL RESULTS?Immediately!. The pickup is appreciably greater. Smoke will be much less. A couple of hundred hours of running time to dissolve the accumulated deposits and then components surfaces will stay clean. HOW IS THE E.L.V.I.S. MOUNTED?Just like an extra fuel filter. Mount it between the existing fuel filter and injector pump or carburator.CAN I MOUNT IT MYSELF?If you can install a fuel filter its the same.

Many can be found in second hand shops, coin shops, superstores like Wal-Mart, or broken things that you take apart. You just have to know where to look. Scroll down and see for yourself!Some of the things we will be looking for are:Coins     Batteries     Spark plugs     Fishing sinkers     Light bulbs     Jewelry    Electronic devices \u2013 cell phones, computers, etc.Why collect? Element collections are not just the playthings of wealthy eccentrics. Whether you are a lover of science, just curious, or want to make a collection of the elements, possessing samples is a great way to bring the periodic table to life. Even a partially completed element collection makes a wonderful educational tool, and can help to spark interest in science and chemistry in children. In fact, I think that every school should have at least a basic one. Collecting elements presents its own unique challenges. For one, collecting them all is actually impossible! Also:Many  are nearly unobtainable due to their high cost.     Some  are toxic, radioactive, or won\u2019t stick around long because they  have short half-lives (they decay into more stable elements).     Ownership  of some is prohibited by law.     Others  are highly reactive, and must be stored under oil or in a vacuum.    My advice is to enjoy collecting, whether you have two samples or twenty. Take your time; element collecting is a long-term project. Also, if you are unsatisfied with one of your samples, keep in mind that you can always buy a better sample later on. Finally, don't forget to tell people about your collection! That way, when other people run across good samples they will tell you about them or maybe even donate them to you.How To Go About It Obviously, you could use the internet and a credit card to buy samples of the elements. Searching for them offline, however, is much more fun, and is a great way to get your feet wet in the hobby. Unfortunately, there are very few resources to help with this kind of collecting. Starting out, I was discouraged by the seemingly vast amount of research and expense involved, and I think many others probably are as well. I hope this little guide will help you join in the fun, even if you are only casually interested. As with all great hobbies, you can learn a lot from element collecting. Here I will share my findings with you.Going further As your collection grows, you can build a shelf in the shape of the periodic table like the one pictured above to display it. People will instantly recognize the shape of the periodic table, and be drawn to it. To build one like mine, which cost me about $16, check out my instructable. Notice that the samples are not labeled, so people have to guess as to their identity! People who don\u2019t care much about science may be impressed when you hand them an element they have never seen before, or have only seen in photographs.A few notes before we begin: The density, or specific gravity, of the elements is measured in grams per cubic centimeter (abbreviated g/cm3 or g/cc). This is useful for comparing the elements to each other or to water, which has a density of one gram per cubic centimeter. The density of aluminum, for example, is 2.7 g/cm3. This means that aluminum is 2.7 times as dense asan equal volume of water. Heavier iron comes in at 7.874 g/cm3, while even heavier lead is 11.35 g/cm3.

However, due to the difficulty of backing up his findings with references to primary sources, he cannot guarantee the absence of errors. Sorry!

Since 1982, it has been composed of a core of 99.2% zinc and 0.8% copper, plated with a layer of pure copper (Please note that not all pennies minted in 1982 have a zinc alloy core, as member lbrewer42 pointed out. If you go with 1983 or later you will be safe).This makes zinc an easy one. Simply sanding off the copper plating of a post 1982 penny reveals the core of bluish zinc underneath, a sample that is greater than 99% pure.All you need is:A U.S. one cent piece (penny) minted 1982 or later      sandpaper or a flat metal file Be patient! It may take you 10-20 minutes to scratch off all the copper on a penny (without power tools), as you will have to file away all of the coin\u2019s embossed details.What about other samples of zinc?Corrosion-resistant zinc plating of steel (hot-dip galvanizing) is the major application for zinc. Zinc plated items you might easily obtain include:Nuts, bolts, washers, and other mechanical fasteners      Acidic fruit and fruit juices often come in galvanized cans ( the galvanization is on the inside)Zinc is used in batteries; here is a link to a tutorial showing you how to take the zinc from one. The zinc you get from a battery will probably be brittle and corroded, as the ammonium chloride inside the battery reacts with the zinc. See the picture above.Picture note: pieces of zinc from a carbon-zinc battery. Zinc oxide is white, and I presume that is what we are seeing here.Pure zinc is rather brittle, so other metals are added to make it more durable. A predominantly zinc alloy, used for small non-structural castings, is found in things like:Die cast toys like matchbox cars.      Some garden hose fittings.Brass is an alloy of zinc and copper.Fun with zinc!Zinc works well for metal casting, as its melting point (787\u00b0F, 420\u00b0C) is relatively low. This means you can sand a bunch of pennies and place them in a stainless steel ladle, then use a torch to melt them. Working with molten metal is dangerous, so take the proper precautions. Other metals that you can melt include aluminum, tin, and lead.On the other hand, if you do not have a torch, you can still melt the little zinc disks by placing them in an empty steel vegetable can, then putting the can on hot coals like those of a campfire. The can is made of steel so it won\u2019t melt, and it\u2019s thin so it won\u2019t draw much heat away from your zinc. In addition, everybody has one! Because I wanted a larger sample of zinc, I melted down 22 pennies this way, though I did get a fair amount of slag (the scum of oxidization that forms on molten metals) floating on top. This was somewhat due to the fact that I didn\u2019t remove all of the copper plating before melting: I only sanded the edges of the coins. See the picture.Zinc, or even just a piece of zinc-plated steel, makes a good electrode when building a battery out of a vegetable or lemon.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FUD/PY3L/IMNOGTB5/FUDPY3LIMNOGTB5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8N/3Y0N/IMNOGSRM/F8N3Y0NIMNOGSRM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXZ/1RBN/IMDOELTG/FXZ1RBNIMDOELTG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Let's Start With Zinc!"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Many people have a few foreign coins hidden in a drawer somewhere, and this is a great place to start looking for nickel. Nickel has been widely used in coins, though its rising price has led to some replacement with cheaper metals in recent years. U.S. coins have never been made of pure nickel, but rather a copper-nickel alloy. The U.S. five cent piece, for example, is made of 25% nickel, 75% copper. Canada, on the other hand, struck their five-cent coins in 99.9% pure nickel during the non-war years from 1922\u20131981 (during the wartime period of 1942\u201345, most or all nickel was removed from Canadian and U.S. coins, due to nickel's war-critical use in armor). Canada also used 99.9% nickel in its higher-value coins from 1968 - 2000.These are just a few of the pure nickel coins out there:Canadian nickels minted between 1922 \u2013 1941 and 1946 \u2013 1981      Canadian quarters minted 1968 \u2013 2000It would be nice to have a more complete list, but it would require a lot of research. If you don\u2019t have any foreign coins lying around, you can always go to a coin shop. My coin shop had a basket of assorted foreign coins on their counter, for sale at 10 cents apiece. When I found a Canadian nickel minted in 1940, the owner of the shop kindly donated it to me. What could be a better sample of nickel than an actual nickel? Nickel, like iron, is attracted to a magnet. This means that nickel coins will be attracted to a magnet, though coins made of copper-nickel alloy and nickel-plated steel will as well. The color of nickel has a very slight yellowish tinge, but this is often only readily apparent when you are comparing its color to that of another metal.What about other samples of nickel?About 6% of world nickel production is still used for corrosion-resistant pure-nickel plating, like on the toenail clippers pictured above.Many electric guitar strings are nickel wire wound around a central steel core, although some cheaper strings are wound in nickel-plated steel wire.Side Note: At one time Canada was the world\u2019s leading producer of the metal. The nickel was mined in the Sudbury Basin, and the nickel is believed to have been deposited (I think the magma thrown out by the impact contained a lot of nickel anyway)by a large nickel-iron meteorite that created the basin.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F29/3NQW/IMNOGT9A/F293NQWIMNOGT9A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJK/NGUI/IMDOELGG/FJKNGUIIMDOELGG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH3/AQFP/IMNOGSJM/FH3AQFPIMNOGSJM.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Nab Some Nickel"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Sadly, most things referred to as tin, including tin cans and tin toys, are not made out of pure tin. Tin cans are, at best, only steel that is plated with tin. The toys are some kind of alloy that may or may not contain much tin. The best sample I have ever found are the tin fishing sinkers pictured above. As you can see, tin has a very bright, shiny white color.You can find tin fishing sinkers anywhere fishing gear is sold. I found mine at Wal-Mart, and paid 1.78 USD for six removable split shot sinkers, the biggest ones they had. If you haven\u2019t been fishing, you should know that you crimp this type of sinker onto your fishing line by placing the string in the sinkers\u2019 jaws and closing it with pliers. This type can also be removed by squeezing the back of the sinker with pliers; this opens the jaws back up. The sinkers are very soft, and I believe them to be commercially pure tin (99.8%).What about other samples of tin?The primary application of tin is solder. One of the most common solders is 60/40, and is about 60% tin, 40% lead. Some lead free solders can contain as much as 90% tin.Tin cans usually have an extremely thin layer of tin on the outside, and other things like the leads of electronic components are coated in tin.Fun with Tin!When a bar of tin is bent, a crackling sound known as the tin cry can be heard due to the twinning of the crystals. You can hear a very small version of the tin cry, at least a tin whimper, with a tin fishing sinker of the split shot variety. While holding the sinker close to your ear, gently (it will take very little effort!) squeeze the back of the sinker with pliers. The sinker will make little pinging or twinkly noises as it bends and the mouth of the sinker opens. Try to convert it to grey tin:If you put tin sinkers in a freezer that hovers near zero degrees Fahrenheit, they should slowly undergo a transformation. The sinkers are made of tin, in the form of metallic or \u2018white\u2019 tin, but in cold temperatures, the atoms will slowly rearrange themselves into a different crystal structure and the sinker will become \u2018grey\u2019 tin. This transformation is often called \u2018tin pest\u2019, as it is undesirable for something made of tin to transform into grey tin. Grey tin has properties similar to a metalloid (for more about metalloids, see the next step, silicon). Commercial grades of tin (99.8%) resist transformation because of the inhibiting effect of the small amounts of bismuth, antimony, lead and silver present as impurities. I put one of my sinkers in my freezer, which is hovering around five degrees. It has been a month and so far no visible change.Even if you get a sinker to transform into grey tin, keep in mind that it is still tin; the atoms are just aligned differently. It may still make an interesting sample.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F36/M6CX/IMDOELRG/F36M6CXIMDOELRG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYB/UZI9/IMDOF7CG/FYBUZI9IMDOF7CG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU1/KM28/IMNOGSN0/FU1KM28IMNOGSN0.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Take Hold of Tin"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Silicon is a dark grey metalloid. Most elemental silicon lives inside electronic devices, making up the heart and soul of such semiconducting devices as diodes, transistors, and integrated circuits. To see the silicon inside these devices, all you have to do is smash them with a hammer. Sadly, though, the silicon portion of these components can be surprisingly small. The picture above shows how much silicon you can expect to find inside a large rectifier diode. These are black cylindrical devices with a white or silver band at one end. They have two leads, or legs. They are easy to find in many kinds of electronics, and microwave ovens usually contain one large one.To open a diode, you will need:A rectifier diode, the biggest one you can find. They are designated by a cr or d on circuit boards. A hammer      A hard surface you can hammer on      Safety glasses      Pliers      Wire cutters or soldering ironOnce you have found a diode, either de-solder the leads from the printed circuit board (if it\u2019s attached to one) or cut the diode free with wire cutters. Then, while holding one of the leads of the diode in the pliers, rest the body of the diode against a hard surface and strike it with the hammer. Make sure you put on safety glasses to protect your eyes from flying diode fragments. Trust me they\u2019ll be flying. It probably won\u2019t take more than a few hits to pulverize the diode\u2019s casing, and then you can pull the broken pieces away to reveal the silicon junction. If the junction hasn\u2019t broken by now, you will have to hit it with a hammer to break it open, revealing two broken hexagonal surfaces of silicon like you see in the picture. The silicon is not pure; pure silicon is not very useful. Silicon makers spice up their silicon with phosphorus, boron, or other goodies. This is called \u2018doping\u2019 the silicon, and doped silicon has very useful (and fascinating) semiconducting properties.Transistors:A similar technique to what we used with the diode can be used when opening large transistors. Transistors always have three leads, or legs. Integrated circuits:Integrated circuits today mostly come in black plastic packages, though in the past they could be found in ceramic packages or even round metal cans. The case of an integrated circuit can be opened (or more often smashed) to expose the chip inside, though the brittle chip is usually broken to bits in the process. I have had the most luck with old ceramic ICs (some computer processors are still made with ceramic cases) and with the old metal can type. With the can type you can simply cut around, and then pop off, the top of the can. What you will see inside is:In common integrated circuits, a wafer of monocrystalline (cut from a large single crystal) silicon (often refined to an extremely high purity of 99.9999999%) serves as a mechanical support for microscopic circuits: thousands of individual diodes, transistors, or even resistors are created in the top few thousandths of an inch by doping. They are insulated from each other by thin layers of glasslike silicon oxide, an insulator that is easily produced by exposing parts of the wafer to oxygen under the proper conditions. The \u201cwires\u201d that connect the components together are then layered onto the surface of the chip.What about other samples of silicon?Photo-voltaic cells (solar panels) are made with thin layers of silicon. A small panel from a calculator or solar stake light might make a good sample, but I am not sure what you are actually seeing when you look at a solar cell.Silicon is not a metal, but rather a metalloid. Metalloids conduct electricity like the metals, although not as well. They are also more crystalline than the metals, making them hard and brittle. The silicon you will find in semiconductors is brittle and chips easily. In nature, silicon is primarily found combined with oxygen, forming silica. Silica is the main ingredient of sand, quartz, and glass.There are ways reduce silica, or sand, into elemental silicon. They involve fiery chemical reactions.

Pictured above are my carbon samples. The four carbon rods are from batteries that I took apart. At the bottom is a section of carbon fiber arrow shaft, cut from a broken arrow. Both represent carbon in the form of graphite. Graphite and diamond are both carbon, the carbon molecules are simply connected to each other differently. This gives graphite and diamond very different properties. For example, graphite is opaque and black, while diamond is highly transparent. Graphite is soft enough to form a streak on paper, while diamond is the hardest naturally-occurring material known. Densities:graphite: 2.267 g/cm3     diamond: 3.515 g/cm3To remove a carbon rod from a battery:Carbon rods form the positive electrodes inside common zinc-carbon dry cell batteries. These kinds of batteries do not have the word \u201calkaline\u201d on the case, but usually say something like heavy-duty, extra-heavy-duty, or even super-heavy-duty. The rods shown came out of a dead 6-volt lantern battery, and their extraction is detailed in the other pictures. For more detailed instructions on battery disassembly, see this tutorial. Once you get the carbon rod out of the battery, it may have a sticky tar-like substance on one end; this can be removed with a solvent (I used gasoline) on an old rag. Any residual black powder (manganese dioxide mixed with carbon, moist with electrolyte) still sticking to the rod can be wet sanded off, using a piece of wet-or-dry sandpaper and running water. A final scrub with warm soapy water makes the rods ready for direct handling and display.Safety Tip: Disassembling this kind of battery is not exactly dangerous, but you will have to protect yourself from the caustic electrolyte inside. Despite being called \u201cdry cells\u201d, the compounds inside are moist with an electrolyte that is hard on skin and will corrode anything metal it meets. You must wear rubber gloves (or at the very least a few layers of plastic grocery bags) over your hands. Another guide to taking apart a lantern battery.Neat Fact: The carbon rod in the battery is chemically inert, and is used here because carbon is a non-corrodible conductor. Every common metal would quickly be corroded away by the electrolyte. Carbon fiber arrow shafts:Graphite can be formed into strong fibers. The fibers are lightweight, owing to carbon\u2019s low density (in this form, which is graphite) of 2.2 g/cm3.My arrow shaft is made of these fibers, with the fibers running perpendicular to each other in layers. Very cool. My shaft says 100% carbon, but I am unsure what this actually means. You can buy arrow shafts, at least around archery season, at Wal-Mart for 3-4 dollars. Other things made of carbon fiber include ski poles, fishing rods, and other high end sporting equipment.What about other samples of carbon?Don\u2019t forget other forms of carbon, like diamonds.Pencil lead is graphite, mixed with a binder, usually a clay or wax-like substance.Fun with carbon!Carbon can be used as an electrode, like in a DIY mini arc furnace.You can also use it to stir molten metals.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5F/WCJZ/IMCFCTSS/F5FWCJZIMCFCTSS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB1/RJ04/IMNOGSUT/FB1RJ04IMNOGSUT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI4/NGOW/IMNOGSV9/FI4NGOWIMNOGSV9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYK/5BDT/IMNOGSVL/FYK5BDTIMNOGSVL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBV/AQ0E/IMNOGSVW/FBVAQ0EIMNOGSVW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Collect Some Carbon"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Believe it or not, you probably have some gold on you right now. Not wearing any jewelry, you say? How about your cell phone? Inside just about every phone is maybe 50 cents to a dollars worth of gold, in the form of a very thin sheet layered onto the circuit board inside. The gold forms the tiny conductive circuit pathways that connect the many different components on the board to each other, a job more commonly performed by copper.Many people have a few old cell phones hiding in their closet. Circuit boards with gold can also be found in computers, portable mp3 players, and many other miniaturized electronic devices. If you are ambitious, you can extract some of the gold from a circuit board, and then possibly melt it into a little nugget with a torch. The amount of gold on a circuit board is very small though, and is probably not worth all the extra effort. If you want to try it, here\u2019s the link.Gold is also used as plating on electrical connectors. The theory is that because gold won\u2019t corrode, it will always form a good connection. Gold plated connectors can be found on some of the more expensive electronics cables, such as audio, video and USB cables. Quality ear buds and headphones often feature gold plated plugs. The gold plating is not very durable however, and will wear off if the connector is plugged and unplugged enough times. For these applications, a more durable nickel plating is often better. Also, keep in mind that not all gold plating is created equal. Some are thin and look like gold, can be advertised as gold, but are actually so thin that they don\u2019t do a whole lot of good except color the object yellow.Gold plated fuses can be bought, and these may be a small and inexpensive way to get a sample of gold. Or you could just clip the plug off of your beats headphones (ha ha).There is also gold plated jewelry.Next we move on to jewelry, and other fine things that are made of gold.24 karat gold is pure gold. As far as I know it is only available as bullion or bullion coins. These are really expensive, however, so we won\u2019t talk about them here. All the other gold you see in jewelry and other luxury items is mostly not pure because pure gold is too soft to make into anything practical. Other metals are added to make it harder and more durable. A karat is one 24th part. That means:20 karat gold is 20 parts gold, 4 parts other metals, or 83% pure gold.      18 karat gold is 18 parts gold, 6 parts other metals, or 75% pure gold.      12 karat gold is 12 parts gold, 12 parts other metals, or 50% pure gold.      10 karat gold is 10 parts gold, 14 parts other metals, or 42% pure gold.            Keep in mind that the karat system is not precise, and the percentages can be fudged a little bit. For example, a 99% gold alloy can be marketed as 24 karat. If you look at the inside of a gold band or ring, a karat mark, usually a number and the letter K, should be visible.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FRW/PBZQ/IMDOEUQT/FRWPBZQIMDOEUQT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8Q/PHYN/IMCFCTT0/F8QPHYNIMCFCTT0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWW/XW4F/IMCFCTSY/FWWXW4FIMCFCTSY.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Grab Some Gold"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "Want an inexpensive sample of silver? Look no further than your coffee maker. Yup, you heard right. Your coffee maker. If you open up a coffee maker, you will find two small thermal fuses that have silver plated cases and lead wires. Thermal fuses are also found in other heat-producing electrical appliances such as hair dryers, water heaters, hot plates, and space heaters. They function as safety devices to disconnect the current to the heating element in case of a malfunction (such as a defective thermostat) that would otherwise allow the temperature to rise to dangerous levels, possibly starting a fire.What about other samples of silver?We have:Silver plated articles     Silver bearing solder     \u2018junk\u2019 silver coins     Sterling Silver articles     Silver bullion coins and barsCoins are a good representative of silver, as it has been a widely used coinage metal for thousands of years. U.S. quarters, dimes, and half dollars minted before 1965 are all composed of 90% silver, 10% copper. Pure silver is soft, so the copper increases the coin\u2019s durability and helps it resist the wear and tear of circulation. Most of these coins are not in circulation any more, but if you are extremely fortunate, you may still find one in your change. Always check your change! First look at the year on the coin, the silver ones are minted 1964 or earlier. Next, look at the edge of the coin. A silver coin is made of one solid alloy, whereas these coins today visibly consist of a sandwich of different metals. Note: The Morgan and Peace silver dollars are 90% silver as well, but you will never find these in your pocket change. All the 90% silver coins, unless they are in very good condition and therefore have some numismatic value, are called \u2018junk\u2019 silver.To get pure silver you have to buy silver bullion, which is mostly sold in the form of coins, rounds, or bars. One example is the $1 silver eagle, a 1 oz. silver bullion coin issued by the U.S government that is 99.93% silver and only 0.07% copper. These coins are never circulated, and each contains an ounce of pure silver. Although the face value is $1, this is not the coin\u2019s actual value. Silver coins and bullion can both be bought at coin shops. Sometimes you will find the junk silver coins at flea markets or pawnshops. The price of silver, which goes up and down, will dictate how much you pay for them. However, keep in mind that you will not be paying the spot price per ounce that is shown on the precious metal exchange. You have to pay a premium on top of the spot price, and this premium may be large or small depending on what form the silver takes. For example, the U.S. silver eagle mentioned above commands a high premium. Before buying silver, make sure you are an educated buyer so you don\u2019t end up paying too much. If you are new to silver, I recommend reading this article on silver investing. It will show you all the different options.Approximate prices as of January 2016, when the spot price hit a five-year low, and was trading around $14 an ounce, at my local coin shop:a junk silver dime goes for about 1.25a junk silver quarter for 3.13, a silver eagle $18.Silver can be a little pricey for some collectors, but remember that silver will retain its value so you can sell it and regain some of your investment if you want to. You might even make a few bucks if you bought low and sold high. Or, when the zombie horde is approaching you can trade your silver for a hatchet and a case of beer. Cheers!Most silver in jewelry is an alloy called Sterling Silver. Sterling Silver is 92.5% silver and 7.5% copper, meaning it is slightly more pure than junk silver coins. If you have something made of sterling silver, it will have usually had the word Sterling stamped on it somewhere. The only exceptions would be if the Sterling Silver article is too small to have a word stamped on it, or the article does not have an inconspicuous place for the stamp (where the stamp would not ruin the article\u2019s appearance). If it doesn\u2019t say Sterling on it, but it has the appearance of silver, it may be silver plate. Silver plated articles are common, and can be found rather easily in second had shops or at yard/garage sales. There you may also find silver plated flatware. A silver plated trinket or piece of jewelry makes a good sample, or even just a plated fork or spoon.It is a good idea for you to familiarize yourself with the appearance of silver. The most distinctive face is a tarnished surface; silver tarnishes black, sometimes with rainbow hues and other colors mixed in. Silver is actually a slightly better conductor than copper, but is rarely used for electrical purposes because of its price.Note: Oneida and W.M.A. Rogers are manufacturers of silver plated articles.Fun with silver!One way I know to test if something is silver is to place it in the yolk of a hardboiled egg.

You would think this would put it out of reach of the humble collector, but you will be surprised to learn that it doesn\u2019t.To look for platinum, we turn to automobiles. Platinum is the least reactive metal. It has a remarkable resistance to corrosion, even at high temperatures. Because of this, it is used to make electrodes for some automobile spark plugs and oxygen sensors. The spark plugs are now common, and can be bought in auto parts stores and often in superstores like Wal-Mart. They are expensive though, so a better option would be to get used ones the way I did. For most people this might mean talking to a mechanic and asking for old spark plugs that come out of vehicles, but I took mine out of junk cars destined for the salvage yard. The plugs by themselves are cool samples, as they have the word platinum printed right on the side. I was unsatisfied with the visibility of the actual platinum, however, so I cut away part of the plug so I could see it better. To replicate what I did, you will need:Platinum Spark plug     Hacksaw     Bench grinder     Hammer     Small flathead screwdriver     Safety glasses and gloves     Bench viseMy samples are Bosch Platinum plugs, which boast on the package that the center electrode is comprised of a slender 99.9% pure platinum rod. I first donned gloves and protective eyewear. Then, using a bench vise to hold the plug horizontally, I used a hacksaw to cut around the outside of the plug and remove the outer electrode. Next, I cleaned up my rough hacksaw cut on a bench grinder. Afterwards, I rested the ceramic insulator against a hard surface and struck it with a hammer, fracturing it. Finally, I was able to pick off the chunks of broken ceramic around the center electrode with a small screwdriver and reveal the platinum. Once again, you can clean up the possibly sharp edge of the ceramic on the bench grinder. To look at a sample prepared this way, people have the body of the plug to hold onto. What about other samples of platinum?I haven\u2019t done much research on other sources of platinum, as I was satisfied with my sample. However, there is still:Jewelry:Platinum finds use in jewelry, usually as a 90\u201395% alloy, due to its inertness and shine.Catalytic converters:Catalytic converters are vehicle emissions control devices, found on the underside of cars. They look a little like a small muffler, and are mounted just behind the engine with the exhaust manifold feeding directly into them. The platinum (or other platinum group metal or metals) helps complete the combustion of the residual unburned hydrocarbons in the engine exhaust. More research is needed, as converters may not contain platinum in a form that is sample worthy.  Oxygen sensors:Oxygen sensors are mounted very close by the converter, also on the exhaust system. They sense the level of oxygen in the exhaust, and tell the engine\u2019s computer controller if the fuel is being burned properly. Some of them have platinum electrodes.Fun with platinum!Want to record a message that will be readable an eon from now?

Maybe some old fishing equipment that no one uses? This is a good place to look for lead. Fishing sinkers have been made out of lead for a long time, due to lead\u2019s high density (70% more dense than iron). Even if you don\u2019t have any lead sinkers lying around, they can still be bought cheaply at any retailer that sells fishing equipment. The package will probably have the word \u2018lead\u2019 printed on it, or at least something like, \u201cthis product contains lead, a substance known to the state of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm\u201d. Sinkers are good samples; they often come in convenient plastic baggies.What about other samples of lead?Lead is a common enough metal, and (as you probably already know) can also be found in:Tire balances     Automotive battery clamps     Lead bullets and shotThe small weights attached to the wheel rims of most cars, called tire balances, are lead, cast around a piece of steel that allows the weight to be clipped onto the rim. You might be able to pry one off an old wheel rim, as long as it doesn\u2019t have a tire mounted on it.90% of the world market for lead is in storage batteries, because nearly all cars use lead-acid batteries for their electrical needs. Inside these batteries, which are big black plastic boxes, are plates of lead hardened with antimony. Also, the battery posts and clamps are often made of lead. The clamps can be purchased in retail stores that carry automotive parts, and make for sizable samples.Lead bullets and shot, which are alloyed with antimony for hardness, are also a good source of lead. Since it is dangerous to remove the lead slug from a live round, or to remove lead shot from a shotgun shell, I recovered bullets for my collection by digging them out of a hillside. The hillside had been used to back a target. As an extra bonus, I was taking lead out of the environment. Fun with lead!Lead is not very fun, a fact that was brought to the public\u2019s attention recently by a water toxicity crisis in Flint, Michigan. Keep in mind that lead is a potent toxin, and can be absorbed through your skin. To limit your exposure, here are a few guidelines to keep you safe:Always wash your hands after handling anything lead, or anything that contains lead - this will keep it from being absorbed into your skin or finding its way onto things that you touch (or worse, into your mouth). The best idea is to handle lead objects with gloves, or put them in plastic baggies so you don\u2019t have to touch them (this is how I keep my samples).Never sand or grind on a piece of lead \u2013 this is the worst thing you could do, because it puts small lead particles into the air that you could breathe.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FEW/YACP/IMCFCTT2/FEWYACPIMCFCTT2.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Locate Some Lead"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "The element tantalum is indispensable for making electronic components called capacitors. This is because capacitors made with tantalum can be made smaller than other kinds of capacitors, while still performing the same function. They are mostly found inside miniaturized electronic devices, including cell phones, computers, mp3 players, key fobs, and countless others. Tantalum capacitors are also more rugged than other kinds of capacitors, making them reliable even in extreme environments like the one found inside the engine compartment of your car.More than 90% of all tantalum electrolytic capacitors are manufactured as surface mounted chip capacitors like the yellow-orange rectangular ones in the picture. Less common are the epoxy-dipped radial-lead \"pearls\", followed by the very rare axial lead variety. Remember that capacitors always have two leads, or legs. They are designated by the letter C, which is often printed on the circuit board right near the capacitor along with that particular capacitor\u2019s number. Again, see the picture.Placing a tantalum capacitor in your collection is a good representative of tantalum, because it is the prime commercial application of the metal. They can be robbed from circuit boards or bought at electronics stores like Radio Shack. To see tantalum metal, however, you will have to burn off the epoxy or plastic case of one of these capacitors. To do this, you will need:Tantalum capacitor - I suggest the biggest one you can find.     Candle, and something to light it with     Needle nose pliers     Wire cutters or soldering iron (to remove a capacitor from a circuit board)     A good work surface, preferably one that cannot be damaged by heat, in a place where you will be able to find something small if you accidentally drop it.            First, clip or de-solder the tantalum capacitor from the circuit board (if attached to one). Then, while holding it in the jaws of needle nose pliers, hold it in the flame of a candle. The goal is to burn off the insulation on the capacitor. As the insulation burns and turns to ash, you can knock a layer of it off and continue burning. At some point the core of the capacitor will be only covered by a black powdery substance. Don\u2019t confuse this layer as insulation, it won\u2019t burn away. This is manganese dioxide. You should stop heating the capacitor core now, otherwise:If you continue to heat the capacitor after most of the insulation has burned away, you can trigger a rapid exothermic reaction similar to the thermite reaction. The manganese oxide will give up its oxygen atoms, which form new bonds tantalum, burning it to create tantalum oxide. The core of the capacitor will ignite, burning with a small flame of its own for a second or two until it glows white hot. It won\u2019t melt though, as tantalum has a very high melting point (5,463\u00b0F). The reaction only lasts for a few seconds, and it scared me the first time it happened. I wasn\u2019t hurt, but handling anything that hot even for a short time is very dangerous. If you can get all the insulation off without triggering the reaction and fusing your sample, you have a sample of tantalum.The core of the capacitor is made of tantalum powder that has been sintered into a nugget around a tantalum wire. The tantalum nugget is then coated with manganese dioxide, a black powdery substance. The leads are then attached and the whole thing is coated in epoxy.Wet tantalum capacitors:\u201cWet\u201d tantalum capacitors, like the ones on the left side of the picture at the top of this step, are rarely seen. Mostly they are used in industrial, military, or even aerospace applications. They have a wet electrolyte, but still contain a sintered tantalum pellet like the epoxy dipped kind, hence they are sometimes called wet slug tantalum capacitors. Some have silver cases, while others have tantalum casings. The ones I found I robbed offof a circuit board, but I can't remember what the board came out of. I googled the number on the case (109D) and found they are the \u201c109D Commercial Style\u201dwith a \u201csilver case, elastomer seal\u201d.

When I first saw it, I thought it indicated that the tube had failed, or \u2018burned up\u2019. However, this is not the case. Barium metal has been evaporated onto the inside of the glass envelope, forming something called a getter spot. The getter helps to maintain a vacuum, because the highly reactive barium metal combines with or absorbs unwanted gases. While the color of barium metal is silvery-white, this rapidly vanishes upon oxidation, giving way to a dark gray oxide layer, which I assume is most of what we are seeing here. Newer getter spots may appear more shiny and mirror like. If the getter is exposed to atmospheric air (for example, if the tube breaks or develops a leak), it turns white and becomes useless. Barium\u2019s reactivity means that it must be stored in a vacuum or under oil.Manufacture of this type of getter:A look underneath a getter spot will reveal a metal trough, usually semicircular, that contained the barium metal during the tube\u2019s manufacture. After the air was pumped out and the tube sealed, the trough was heated with an induction heater (which was held near the trough, outside of the tube). The trough got red hot and the barium became vaporized, instantly reacting with any residual gas, then condensing on the cool walls of the tube in a thin coating, the getter spot or getter mirror, which continues to absorb gas. This is the most common type, used in low power vacuum tubes. Specialized tubes may use a more exotic getter material like zirconium.I found vacuum fluorescent displays in old microwaves. Vacuum fluorescent displays have getter spots, though LED displays are more common nowadays. I found my vacuum tube inside an old TV, which was in an old dump. The transistor was invented in 1947, and by the late 1960\u2019s had almost completely replaced the vacuum tube.A look around a flea market or antique shop may yield old electronics that contain vacuum tubes, or even just the tubes themselves (I have seen both).Vacuum tubes are still used in high-end audio equipment, notably guitar amplifiers.Note: Keep in mind that not all getters use barium. A functioning phosphorus getter looks very much like an oxidized metal getter, although it has an iridescent pink or orange appearance which oxidized metal getters lack.

A big filament is best, and these come from high wattage light bulbs. Light bulbs used in automobiles can also have large diameter filaments, because they use the lower voltages provided by car batteries. The drawbacks of filament samples are that they are small, and to remove one from a bulb you have to deal with the potential hazard of broken glass. When braking light bulbs, I recommend wrapping the bulb in a piece of cloth like material, then smashing it with a hammer. If you do it right, the glass bits will be contained by the material. Then, you can separate the filament from the bulb. Alternatively, leave the filament in and use the base of the bulb as a holder of sorts.Tungsten is quite heavy, just slightly less dense than gold. It would be cool to have a sample big enough that would allow you to feel this property.What about other samples of tungsten?Wikipedia states that:High-density alloys of tungsten with nickel, copper or iron are used in high-quality darts (to allow for a smaller diameter and thus tighter groupings) or for fishing lures (tungsten beads allow the fly to sink rapidly). Some types of strings for musical instruments are wound with tungsten wires. I have a golf club that advertises copper-tungsten weighting. I can\u2019t see it though; I think it is inside the club head.My wal-mart sells tungsten fishing weights, though they cost around 6-7 USD for four and are no doubt an alloy of some kind.TIG (tungsten inert gas) welding utilizes tungsten electrodes. From what I understand, during welding electricity jumps an arc from the tip of the tungsten electrode to the metal to be welded. At the same time another rod, a filler rod, is placed in the heat of the arc, melting it to form the weld puddle. Tungsten\u2019s high melting point (the highest of any metal, 6129 degrees F) means the electrode can withstand the high temperatures of the arc without melting, though the welding process does slowly consume it.

These smoke detectors are very common; you probably have a few in your home. It\u2019s actually quite easy to tell if you do, because they all have the words \u201ccontains radioactive substance Am 241\u201d molded into the plastic. The americium, in the form of americium dioxide, is plated onto a small metal button inside, mounted in a small enclosure known as the ionization chamber. You can open the smoke detector and take the little button out; it isn\u2019t that hard and there is a great instructable on how to do it. What about the radiation, you ask? The radiation emitted is relatively benign, but to be safe I recommend the following:Keep the americium button in a safe place away from kids, preferably in a small childproof container of some kind. Never touch the face of the button that the americium is plated on. If you do accidentally touch the face of the button, wash your hands.Americium is a synthetic or manmade (not naturally occurring) element, the only such element to have found its way into peoples\u2019 homes. Most ionization smoke detectors contain a maximum of one micro curie (abbreviated 1.0 uC) of americium.One curie = 37 billion spontaneous nuclear transformations per secondmicro = one millionth part, so 1 micro curie is equal to 37 thousand spontaneous nuclear transformations per second.Sometimes this same figure is given in becquerels, and One becquerel = one spontaneous nuclear transformation per second.Therefore, each smoke detector contains a maximum of 37,000 becquerels (abbreviated 37kBq)Every second, about 30,000 of the americium atoms decay. When they do this, a chunk of the atomic nucleus breaks off and goes flying through the air. Primarily this is an alpha particle, which is two neutrons and two protons stuck together (the equivalent of the nucleus of a helium atom). This leaves behind a nucleus with two less protons, meaning the atomic number of the decaying atom drops by two: Americium, element 95, becomes Neptunium, element 93. Alpha particles, because they are large and positively charged, only travel a few inches in air and are easily absorbed by a few sheets of writing paper.The half life of Americium 241 is 432.2 years.The older a smoke detector is, the more Neptunium atoms it will contain. Neptunium-237 has a half-life of 2.14 million years. This means that you can use americium buttons to fill both the americium and neptunium places in an element display. Why radiation in a smoke detector? Inside the detector\u2019s ionization chamber, there are two metal plates sitting opposite each other. Attached to one of them is the americium button, which is emitting a constant stream of alpha particles that cross a small air gap and are then absorbed by the other plate. Because alpha particles each contain two protons, which are positively charged particles, a tiny potential difference (and a tiny current flow) is created between the two metal plates. This current can be sensed by the smoke detector\u2019s circuitry. When smoke particles enter the chamber, they absorb the alpha particles and become ionized, breaking the circuit and triggering the alarm.            I bought my smoke detectors in second hand shops, both for fifty cents. You can find them sometimes with the hardware. Just make sure it says it contains a radioactive element. If you buy one this way, you will probably be keeping a radioactive substance out of a landfill.Another way to get a smoke detector is to buy one in a store, though they may be a bit pricey.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FIO/BQOK/IMCFCTS9/FIOBQOKIMCFCTS9.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 17: The Twofer: Americium and Neptunium"}, {"step": 18, "steps_text": "Unfortunately most things, including cast iron and wrought iron, are not iron but in fact steel, an alloy of iron and carbon.

Crude iron metal is produced in blast furnaces, where ore is reduced by coke to pig iron, which contains 3.5\u20134.5% carbon. Further refinement with oxygen reduces the carbon content to the correct proportion (between 0.002% and 2.1%) to make steel.My advice is to not lose any sleep over the purity of your iron sample, but just place a piece of mild (low-carbon) steel in your collection and be done with it. No one is going to look twice at your sample of iron anyway. As with any of the elements, you can always buy a purer sample online later.

This is because even slight impurities in the copper can drastically lower its conductivity. Copper is an easy metal to find a good sample of, especially because its distinctive peachy color makes it easily identifiable. The challenge, then, is to find a sample of copper that is interesting.For myself, I wanted a heavy sample so that people lifting it could get an idea of copper\u2019s mass. It also had to be compact enough to fit into my collection, and be interesting to look at. A magnetron, the vacuum tube that produces the microwaves that heat food in a microwave oven, provided me with just the sample I needed. Robbed from a dead microwave, I cut out the copper center portion with a hacksaw. The inside of the tube is evacuated, so the copper surfaces inside are untarnished by air and very peachy, at least for a while. Warning: Some magnetrons have beryllium oxide ceramic insulators, which are dangerous if crushed and inhaled, or otherwise ingested. Whatever you do, never break the ceramic insulators of the magnetron. Broken ceramic insulators or magnetrons should not be directly handled. Also, opening a microwave can be dangerous because they contain high voltage capacitors that can store a lethal charge for some time even after the microwave has been unplugged. To be safe I usually let my microwaves sit around for several months. To be extra safe you can:use tools with insulated handles to do the disassembly    Work using only one arm at a time.    Never touch the leads of the capacitor.A really awesome sample would be a piece of native, or naturally occurring copper.

Then using the other pliers I grabbed the edge of the positive side, pulling the edge of it down and away. It was a bit difficult for the pliers to grab the edge, but I was able to wrench the coin cell open on one side this way. These batteries can be sealed pretty tight! Next, I was able to grab the edge of the positive half with one pliers and the edge of the negative half with the other, then wrench the two apart. Now that you have the cell open, you will encounter four things:A small piece of wire mesh.    A cake of black powder (manganese dioxide) moist with electrolyte.    A thin layer of cardboard.    A plastic ring that made the seal between the two halves of the cell.All of these stayed with the negative half of the battery I took apart. I removed them, by picking at them with the screwdriver, in the order they are listed above.

For example, it can replace lead as a dense material in fishing sinkers.The next time you are in Wal-Mart, wander over to the aisle where they sell fishing gear. See if you can find bismuth fishing sinkers. If you don\u2019t see them, you can always try a different Wal-Mart (not all stores carry the same products) or a retailer that sells fishing and outdoor merchandise.

If it costs you ten or twelve bucks to get enough tablets, you may be able to buy a big chunk of bismuth online for less. Bismuth has been used as a replacement for lead in shot and bullets. Bismuth-tin alloy shot is one alternative that provides similar ballistic performance to lead. Many bismuth alloys have low melting points and are found in specialty applications such as solders, as a replacement for traditional tin-lead solders, like in electronics.Many automatic sprinklers, electric fuses, and safety devices in fire detection and suppression systems contain the eutectic In19.1-Cd5.3-Pb22.6-Sn8.3-Bi44.7 alloy that melts at 117 \u00b0F (47 \u00b0C ) Fun with bismuth!High-purity bismuth can form distinctive, colorful hopper crystals. Run an image search for bismuth crystals and see for yourself! The variations in the thickness of the oxide layer that forms on the surface of the crystal causes different wavelengths of light to interfere upon reflection, thus displaying a rainbow of colors. Bismuth is relatively nontoxic and has a low melting point just above 520\u00b0F (271 \u00b0C) , so crystals may be grown using a household stove.

Neon!"}, {"step": 29, "steps_text": "Named after Thor, the Norse god of thunder, Thorium metal is silvery and tarnishes black when exposed to air, forming the dioxide ThO2, also called thoria or thorina.For a sample of thorium we turn to magnetrons, as all magnetrons contain a small amount of thorium (mixed with tungsten) in their filament.according to user dominikK20: \"it actually contains tungsten bits with 2% thorium dioxide. You can add  some 30% H2O2 to them and let that sit for 2 weeks so that all the  tungsten dissolves, then you can get your ThO2 out and reduce it with  magnesium or whatever.\"Why thorium in a magnetron? To understand why, we must understand a little about how a magnetron works.Inside the magnetron, which is evacuated of air to form a vacuum, there are two electrodes. One is the thoriated tungsten center electrode, and the other one is the big cylindrical chunk of copper that has spokes radiating inward from the outside (my copper sample). When a high voltage is applied to both electrodes, the center electrode  becomes very hot and electrons start to \u201cboil\u201d off into the vacuum. Normally the center electrode would have to reach a very high temperature for the electrons to \u201cboil\u201d off like this, but the addition of thorium lowers this temperature. Simply put, the electrons are more willing to make the leap into the vacuum if they get to jump off of thorium atoms! The rest of the filament is tungsten, as tungsten's high melting point prevents it from melting in this instance.Once these electrons are moving freely in the vacuum, they are attracted to the relatively positive outer electrode. However, two big ring magnets located on the outside of the magnetron are generating a mangetic field inside the magnetron that runs parallel to the filament. This causes the electrons to spiral outward from the center electode in a circular path. Now let's consider the outer electrode for a second. See the copper spokes that jut in toward the center? Between them are cavities, and as the electrons spiral outward they brush past the openings of these cavities. Similar to when you blow across the top of a bottle and create a whistling noise, the electrons in the cavities begin to resonate, which causes the electrons to bunch into groups and form waves. These are picked up by an antenna wire attached to the outer electrode and directed through the top of the magnetron tube and into the cooking chamber of your microwave. Thorium-232 is the most stable isotope of thorium (half-life of 14.05 billion years) and accounts for nearly all natural thorium, with the other five natural isotopes occurring only as trace radioisotopes. Thorium-232 decays very slowly through alpha decay to radium-228, starting a decay chain named the thorium series that ends at lead-208. Because thorium decays slowly and only emits alpha particles, it is only weakly radioactive. This makes owning it and even handling small amounts quite safe. The risk of cancer is low, as it never gets airborne in normal usage. Only if the filament is taken out of the magnetron, finely crushed, and inhaled can it pose a health hazard.Other sources of thorium: Thorium is still widely used as an alloying element in TIG welding electrodes (at a rate of 1%\u20132% mix with tungsten)Thorium oxide used to be used in mantles for gas lamps.One question I'd like to know...ARE THE WIRES LEADING INTO THE MAGNETRON MADE OF TUNGSTEN?

However, even if you don't want to put it on your skin, think about where you could put it.... poor jack'o'lantern... Here are all the health concerns that need to be addressed:Fire- no issues, we're diluting it heavily in water.Oxidation- minimal. Unless you leave it on there, there should be no/minimal oxidization. That said, wash your knife anyways. This isn't like some CERTAIN other chemical reactions...Poisonous gasses- nothing to be concerned about here. If you even have ambient air flow, you don't have a thing to worry about. If it produces gasses, they're produced too slow to be a problem and will be completely dissipated. Unless you live in a small air tight box, but then you've got other problems.Toxin-  Yes, it's poisionous. How much? unknown, I'd assume it's not life threatening in the diluted form that we're using, and at most (unless you're drinking these) will have an upset stomach. Don't be licking your \"wound\"...Please note, lethal dose 15g-30g, that's half the bottle! and that's taking it straight! we're only using about 3-5g grams at a time. No issue.Eyes- keep out of eyes, ears, and other orifices as well as cuts (duh) would you rub soap in your eyes? (or real blood for that matter?) no, back to the stupidity disclaimer.Skin contact- Well, here's the main issue I'll assume, once again, we're DILUTING. This means- deconcentrating a solution ( :p )Redness-noneSwelling-noneitching-nonerashes-nonepain-noneincurable diseases- noneSeriously, the safest way is to keep yourself clean. It's the easiest way to keep yourself safe. I have no doubt that with the current concentrations you could cause all of the above problems, but, these will be from multiple hours of exposure. For any short amount of time, these won't be an issue. Unless someone can prove me wrong, I'll stand by that these are harmless for their \"intended\" purpose if the directions are followed. When you're done, wash skin throughly. Besides, you have to anyways if you're going to do it again, right?Also, because their is a chemical reaction, generally both original chemicals lose their properties. (such as chlorine and sodium into salt) The final blood should have even less to worry about, as you're removing much of the original dangerous properties of (really mainly) the ferric nitrate by adding a base (potassium Thiocyanate) and also removing it's properties as well.

Although it is very effective sometimes also we have to scrub too much persistent dirt with the toilet brush, in this case we'll see that the dirt is not nearly stuck to porcelain and may be cleaned easily.

The characteristic indicator that a solution has reached equilibrium is a color change which is brought on by a change in pH. A chemical, or pH indicator, is chosen based off of the calculated equilibrium pH. The pH indicator will change color in that range to signify the equilibrium has been attained. The pH range measures how close or far away from neutral the solution is. Water, for example, has a pH of 7.0 and is considered 'neutral'. From 0.0<7.0, the solution is acidic, and from 7.0<14.0, the solution is considered basic. In an analysis of a strong base and a strong acid, a perfect balance of these two should produce a perfectly neutral solution since the ions of the separate solutions will dissolve equally creating a balance of positive and negative charges of atoms.This instuctrable will lay out the process for creating two stock solutions of a strong acid and base for testing from lab worthy chemicals, how to set up the titration apparatus, and preforming the actual experiment. The stock solutions are sodium hydroxide, a strong base, or hydrochloric acid, a strong acid. An indicator is a certain chemical that changes color depending on the pH, the acidity or basicity, of a liquid mixture. Any sort of chemical experiment involving bases and acids especially requires care not to injure oneself, so wearing a lab coat, goggles and proper attire will help in case of a tragic accident. A laboratory is the ideal place for experiments.Supplies2  50 mL Beakers    50 mL Burette  1.0 M HCl (hydrochloric acid)    1.0 M NaOH (sodium hydroxide)    Phenolphthalein    100 mL Graduated Cylinder    Gloves    Goggles    Lab CoatTime and CostOne hour is a decent approximation for a beginner performing this elementary titration. A reasonable price for the sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid stock solutions are $45.00 if purchased as 1 liter amounts and in a concentration of 1M from a chemical supplier. Phenolphthalein cost $5.00 for a modicum but effective amount (only two drops are needed). An expected budget for glassware is $40.00, and the personal protective equipment will cost around $12.00. (Total price: ~$102.00)CautionAs briefly mentioned, this instructable does deal with dangerous acids and bases. Drinking the chemicals, splashing them on oneself, or doing anything questionable is potentially harmful. Before dealing with these chemicals, search the material safety data sheet (MSDS) information online. Pouring acid into water could cause explosive release of heat, so always pour the acidic solution into a more basic one. Phenolphthalein is a dye and will stain clothes. Broken glass is always a hazard since accidents do happen. having baking soda nearby to neutralize any acid spill is always a good fail-safe.

After extensive research on this site (thanks guys!) and elsewhere I tried my hand at re-tinning a handful of copper pots I picked up from antique store. I was able to get enough information to get started, but I wouldn't say there was enough to make me feel confident about what I was doing.  Thought I would share my experience for anyone else out there with an interest in bringing an old copper pot or pan back to life that doesn't want to pay $4-6 a square inch (plus shipping) to have a pot professionally re-tinned and isn't afraid of a little molten tin!Why copper? Well, it is the best conductor of heat of any metal used for cooking, 25 times better than stainless steel! That means once the heat hits the pot/pan it heats evenly and immediately. You'll use less heat (I can boil on medium), heat is distributed to the entire pot (no hot spots), and heating will be more responsive. These pots/pans excel at anything that is simmered due to their precise temperature control. Plus, copper just looks amazing!Why a tin lining? For those that don't know, the purpose of lining a copper pot/pan with tin is so that acidic foods (tomato based sauces etc) don't react with bare copper and produce copper oxides, which can make food taste strange and if left for long periods of time can lead to mild poisoning. This copper oxide is also called verdigris, and is that green stuff that you see on the Statue of Liberty, or other copper exposed to the elements. Many new copper pots/pans have a stainless steel lining, which is more durable, but more prone to sticking and less conductive than tin. All really old copper pots have tin linings, and those are the ones you're likely to find sitting in antique shops or thrift stores because they look real grungy and scary to cook in (until you bring them back to life!)What do I look for in an old copper pot? If you find an old copper pot, pay attention to the thickness of the walls and the overall weight as these indicate the quality of its construction. Thickness generally ranges from 1mm (more of a display piece) to over 3mm thick (a serious professional/hotel kitchen item). The heavier the pot/pan, the better. It should feel hefty and solid when you pick it up. Really old copper pots often have a brazed \"dovetail\" or \"finger\" joints where the hammered copper sheet was joined together, later models were made using industrial machinery to spin or form them without joints. If you find an old copper pot on craigslist or ebay, be sure to ask how much it weighs, that'll give you a good idea if it's worth what they are asking.Can I do this? While your results definitely won't be as good as having a pro do a hand wiped tinning on the first try (there are several places out there that will do this for you, East Coast Tinning and Rocky Mountain Retinning to name a few), it will definitely be functional. In the end, I decided that since my pots are really old hand hammered and dovetailed pieces of art, I didn't mind if my tin lining isn't totally smooth. These are items that can take a beating, mine are at least 100 years old, and still have a lot of life left in them.

To avoid getting tin on the outside of your pot you can put \"whiting\" on there (powdered chalk with a little water works I'm told). I personally skipped this step and didn't have too many problems with dripping tin on the outside.PRO TIP - To get the tin flowing over a wide area more easily you can also pre-heat your copper pot in an over at 450. If you choose to do this I wouldn't apply flux until the next step when you are out of doors. I've done this with a pre-heat and without, both turned out fine.  SAFETY FIRST. Wear a long sleeve shirt, long pants, and closed toed shoes. The pan will be really hot, as will the tin and you don't want it touching your bare skin. HAVE A RESPIRATOR, EYE PROTECTION AND LEATHER GLOVES. If you use sal ammoniac as your flux it will create a thick white smoke when heated, and from what I hear it will rust anything it touches. Also, not good to breath in since it is corrosive, so use a good respirator mask. Bring your fluxed pot outside (DO NOT DO THIS INSIDE ON YOUR STOVE). I used a propane turkey fryer as a heat source on a medium heat. Put your copper pot on there and slowly heat it.      PRO TIP - Since copper both gains and loses heat quickly you can create a basic brazing hearth using fire bricks. Just lay them our around the flame of your propane burner, google around and you'll get the idea.  The flux allows the tin to stick to the inside of the pot. If using Stay Clean, watch for it to start to get a little dark on the metal while I'm over the fire, and then start spreading on the tinIf using Sal Ammoniac, once the white smoke starts billowing throw in a small piece of tin, or rub some tin bar around the bottom of the pot. If the pot is hot enough (456 degrees or so) the tin will melt right away and turn liquid. Swirl the molten tin around and rub the molten tin on the inside of the pot/pan with your plumbers wad (be sure you have gloves on). You can also use tongs to hold the plumbers wad/wiping cloth so you don't have to get your hands anywhere near the hot pan, probably not a bad idea.  You may have to heat the sides of the pan separately to get the copper hot enough for the tin to bond there. Where the handle meets the pot will also require additional heat (as the handle acts as a heat sink).  Trial and error will play a part. As you are heating you will see when the old tin lining melts, as it starts to get shiny and change color where the heat is applied.

Your tin lining will last much longer if you use wooden (or plastic) utensils. Tin is a fairly soft metal, so stainless steel utensils can/will scratch the lining much more quickly.

Some people love an aged patina on their copper, and this develops quickly just from heating and daily use.

Yeah that's right, 1799! He really drops some knowledge, so below is his full text, with the second tinning step in bold. \"That copper and brass vessels cannot be used with safety in cooking victuals or for holding articles of food, and particularly those which contain acids, is well known. It is also well known that the tinning applied in the usual manner is not durable, being soon worn away by cleaning, and on that account must be frequently renewed. Some, therefore, have proposed enameling for kitchen utensils of copper ; which, indeed, would answer exceedingly well, and be much safer for the health than impure tin mixed with lead, often employed for tinning ; but, unfortunately, enamel is too dear, and readily breaks when the vessel receives the least blow ; which cannot al ways be avoided. The following process for tinning is attended with no danger from poisonous ingredients, as no lead is used in it; the tinning, too, is exceedingly durable, adds strength to the copper vessel and secures it from the action of acids much longer than the common tinning. When the vessel has been prepared and cleaned in the usual manner, it must be roughened on the inside by being beat on a rough anvil, in order that the tinning may hold better, and be more intimately connected with the copper. The process of tinning must then be begun with perfectly pure grained tin, having an addition of sal ammoniac instead of the common colophonium.Over this tinning, which must cover the copper in an even and uniform, manner throughout, a second harder coat must be applied, as the first forms only a kind of medium for connecting the second with the copper. For this second tinning you employ pure grained tin, mixed with zinc in the proportion of two to three, which must be applied also with sal ammoniac smooth and even, so that the lower stratum may be entirely covered with it. This coating, which by the addition of the zinc, becomes pretty hard and solid, is then to be hammered with a smoothing hammer, after it has been properly rubbed and scoured with chalk and water, by which it becomes more solid, and acquires a smooth compact surface. Vessels and utensils may be tinned in this manner on both sides. In this case, after being exposed to a sufficient heat, they must be dipped in the fluid tin, by which means both sides will be tinned at the same time. As this tinning is exceedingly durable, and has a beautiful color, which it always retains, it may be employed for various kinds of metal instruments and vessels, which it may be necessary to secure from rust.\"", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 10: Take Your Tinning to the Next Level!"}], "channel": "No channel to show"}, {"category": "No category to show", "description": "Here I am going to explain how to make alcohol safely at home using an Air Still. This is a very simple and effective bit of kit that is also reasonably safe compared to the alternatives. The distiller is built with an 'underfloor' low energy heating coil which is not in direct contact with the liquid and has a condenser coil located in the black housing cooled by blasting air through it. It also has an automatic lock out switch if the distiller runs dry.There are no naked flames, no exposed heater elements, no running water, no electrical contact relays and lots of air circulation caused by the fan to blow away alcohol fumes. I'm not saying it's perfect, but there have been no reported accidents, as far as I know (Nov. 2016).Paradoxically, to produce a safe product, a hazardous caustic chemical called sodium hydroxide or 'lye' needs to be used. This can be substituted with sodium bicarbonate if wanted, but a far greater quantity will be required to be effective.The alcohol from an Air Still will never be fantastically pure, but will have plenty of interesting flavours due to the fact that the condenser is very close to the actual heating chamber, with little opportunity for reflux in the connecting pipework.", "title": "How to Distill Alcohol", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Distill-Alcohol/", "section": "food", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Air StillpH paper      Sodium hydroxide (pearl not flake), or sodium bicarbonate     Alcohol meterHydrometer      Thermometer      Conductivity Meter eg PRIMO Pocket TDS Tester (0 to 1999ppm)      Gloves and Goggles      Scales (0 to 50g)50ml measuring cylinder      15mm copper pipe cut into 15mm sections x 20 of      3 litre receiver for alcohol produced      Glass storage bottles    Brita Water Filter", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSH/CWF7/IVO4MZH1/FSHCWF7IVO4MZH1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8P/5ZH9/IVO4MZIT/F8P5ZH9IVO4MZIT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9G/0MOJ/IVO4N01C/F9G0MOJIVO4N01C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXH/H59F/IVO4RGX7/FXHH59FIVO4RGX7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIU/P2H2/IVO4RH01/FIUP2H2IVO4RH01.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Equipment"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Potential hazards:Alcohol vapour explosion       Alcohol liquid fire       Heavy metal poisoning eg copper       Sulphurous acid / sulphide poisoning       Methanol poisoning       Electric shock       Irresponsible drinking      Alcohol addiction       Sodium hydroxide burns       User error       Drinking alcohol above 60% concentrationThere should be no naked flames, electrical switching devices, hot surfaces or even mobile phones in the room.

If the pH is less than 6, using gloves and goggles, add pearls of sodium hydroxide to the brew and stir until the pH level actually reaches 6. Some home brew can be quite acidic eg pH 3.0 and it's a good idea to try and weigh the pearls used to make it easier for the next batch. If the brew is acidic, it's quite likely that natural sulphides will turn into sulphurous acid vapour, which will react with metals such as copper to produce copper sulphate, which is poisonous.       Add the copper pipe segments to the still boiler - this is a fall back, just in case something went wrong in step 2 above. The idea is that any remaining acid will react with the copper and the copper sulphate produced will stay in the boiler rather than evaporate.       Add the brew to the boiler, no higher than the line gouged on the inside.       Place a 50ml measuring cylinder under the output spout and turn on the still, ensuring there is plenty of ambient ventilation eg open doors and windows etc.       Collect the first 30ml of distillate and discard it as it will be rich in methanol, which is poisonous. Technically, this is called the 'Heads Cut' and can be adjusted for different desired flavours. Some brews will require a greater heads cut to remove other chemicals such as aldehydes, ketones, esters etc.       Place a large 3 litre 'receiver' jug under the output spout and collect the main run.       Measure the alcohol content using the alcoholmeter every 15 minutes and stop the process when it reaches 40%. Never drink alcohol if it is above 60%. The exact point at which distillation is stopped depends on the flavour profile required - carry on for longer and more oily 'Fusils' will be produced which can give interesting flavours but more chance of a hangover!  If the product is cloudy, this is probably copper soaps hanging in suspension in the fluid and so should be redistilled.  Test the alcohol with pH paper - it should be pH 6.0 and test the conductivity - it should be about a maximum of 10 ppm. If the pH was low there might be sulphurous acid present and if the conductivity was high there might be heavy metal contamination, again, poisonous.      If there is a problem at stage 9 above, pour the product through a Britvic water filter, which contains ion exchange resins and activated carbon for removing chemicals and repeat the test.

Then we taste the product - what other flavours are there present? Is anything too dominant? Are there any subtle flavours lingering in the background that need to be enhanced at all?Experienced, professional, tasters experience a drink like ordinary people might experience a piece of music or a work of visual art. This skill can, however, easily be leant. A useful technique is to use sensory deprivation - blind fold yourself and use ear plugs - sit in a chair for a whole hour doing nothing and then carefully drink some of the product, making a mental note of the range and intensity of the different flavours. Also, ask some of your friends to do the same - it could be fun!Tasting is divided into 3 parts - the smell, the main taste and the aftertaste. A good example of aftertaste is saffron. Drink something with this spice in it and you will experience the most amazing aftertaste that lingers for about 5 minutes!

What I (not so) quickly discovered, is that this is a long and laborious task without a guaranteed positive outcome. The jar you store all your ingredients in must be agitated daily to disperse the flavours and tasted daily because the flavours change every day of ageing; for months, and after all that if you weren't happy with the final product, you just had to take note and start again.So I started to search for a faster, more consistent way and not being unfamiliar with the occult ways of science, I headed in that direction.

I placed the rod at the center of the guide, using the first mark I made as reference. Then, I put three pieces of rod next to it, two of them will give the size of the gap and the final one is the one I marked to be cut and place in that spot. To mark this rod, I first aligned the end of the rod with the upper edge of the guide, and using the hacksaw I mark in the rod where the lower edge of the guide is.

of your heat source is not necessary.  the solution will take care of that.  electric heat is the best.  \ncheck the pic.  i'm using an electric stove.  works great.  you can see how i have it set up and i hope it all makes sense now.  you load your wash into the kettle/pot, apply some heat, and condense the results.\u00a0 how?\u00a0 i'll tell you if you'd just be patient.\u00a0 geez.\nokay, pour your wash into the kettle.  place the stopper into the spout.  turn on the heat.  watch the thermometer.  alcohol boils at a temperature lower than water.  that's what makes distillation work.  exact temperature will vary depending on elevation and barometric pressure, but water boils at around 212 \u00b0F while ethanol boils at around 173 \u00b0F.\u00a0 methanol, that can make you blind and is what you really want to avoid, boils around 148 \u00b0F.  while running your wash, watch for plateaus (when the temperature stays the same for a while -- forms a plateau if you graph it) on your thermometer and compare them to known boiling temperatures to ensure you get only what you want and leave the rest.  check out my instructable to give you the basics of distillation.\nbasically if you begin to distill and the temperature reaches a certain point and remains there for any length of time you have reached the boiling temperature for a particular liquid component of your wash.  check the temperature against the boiling point data you have researched and you can tell what it is you are distilling at the time.  using this information you can discard anything other than ethanol.  no matter what a solution contains, it will not boil at a temperature any higher than what the level of the component with the lowest boiling temperature is until that component is boiled away.  check the comments or 'distilling basics' for a discussion or two on this.\nas an example, if your solution contains methanol, ethanol and water it will happen like this: once the temperature of your solution reaches around 148 \u00b0F methanol will begin to boil and come out through your tube as vapor into your condenser where it will convert back to liquid and exit into your receptacle.\u00a0 the temperature of your solution will not vary much beyond 148 \u00b0F until the methanol is gone and then will begin to climb again until it reaches 173 \u00b0F, the boiling point of the ethanol.\u00a0 the same thing will happen here.\u00a0 the temperature will hover around the same until the ethanol is boiled off and then on to water.\u00a0 \nin order to get ethanol and exclude the rest you get rid of what are called the 'heads' and 'tails.' basically dump anything that boils lower than around 173 \u00b0F and everything after the temperature begins to climb again.\u00a0 this is why i mentioned having more than one receptacle. use one for the heads, one for what you want, and one for the tails.\nso once you've boiled off and then condensed your wash, you should be left with a solution containing a much higher alcohol content than what you started with.\u00a0  you will still get a bit of water, but that's okay.  running the product through the still again will further extract ethanol and raise the proof.  \na bit of trivia: the Xes often seen on moonshine bottles in old cartoons, etc. represent the amount of runnings, or how many times it was distilled.\ni've achieved a blue flame from a wash after a first run with this set up.  you may or may not need to run the wash more than once.  anything over about 150 proof will burn.\u00a0 that's a pretty good result from a single run.\ni do not recommend doing anything i've talked about.  it's not very legal (in the US), and it's not very safe.  i enjoy knowledge for the sake of knowledge, though, and just because i know how to do something doesn't mean i will.  so take this to heart, and take care.  \npeace.\n-p", "step_imgs":

Yes that is right. Almost 80 thousand years.\nThere are many different ways to find moles depending on what you are working with. For solids or liquids that aren't solutions its sample mass/molecular weight=moles. Use a periodic table to find the molecular weight.\u00a0 For example to find one mole of lets say carbon-14 the equation is x/14=1\u00a0\nx=14grams\nAnother example: Find 5 moles of H2O.\nx/18=5\nx=90grams\nFind how many moles are in 20g. of NaCl.\n20/58=x\nx=.345\nI think you can get it from that.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FXR/2ZUX/GBOTQ56A/FXR2ZUXGBOTQ56A.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: The Mole"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Now that you know the mole the second thing you need to do stoichiometry is balanced chemical equations. This is just the basic way. There are more complex equations that can't be balanced this way.\nFirst lets take a simple and common reaction. Combustion. The definition of combustion is a fuel when burned with oxygen produces only H2O and CO2.\nHere we have the combustion reaction of sugar (which happens in your cells and powers your body).\nC6H12O6 + O2 --> H2O + CO2\nTo balance this all you need to do is get the same number of atoms on both sides. First off just pick a molecule(any of them work but the biggest is usually the best) and assign it a number (again any number works but to keep it easy use one).\nSo far we have:\nC6H12O6 + O2 --> H2O + CO2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\nSo on the left side we have 6 carbon atoms 12 hydrogen atoms and an unknown amounts of oxygen atoms.\nTo balance we need the same number on each side.

If you start with the mass of A CHEM then you divide the mass of that substance by its molecular weight(found using the periodic table) to find the moles. Now multiple the number of moles by the coefficient of substance you find the moles of and divide it by the coefficient of the substance you are translating it into. This gives you the number of moles. You can now find find the mass of the product produced using the Sm/Mw=n equation. If you rework the equation its Mw*n=Sm.

You can use the law of conservation of mass to do this. Mass on both sides of the equation must be the same. If you add up the mass for one side it should equal the sum of the mass on the other side. If not you messed up somewhere and need to review your work.\nYou may have noticed I said this is for solids and liquids, but I have been using gases. Theoretically you can use this for any type of stoichiometry if you know the chemical equation and the mass of one of the substances, but in practice gases are difficult to work with, so finding the mass becomes problematic. You need a different mole equation to work with gases.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 3: Stoichiometry of Solids or Liquid Non-solutions"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Stoichiometry with gases everything stays the same but the equation you use to find the moles. It only takes basic knowledge of the gas laws to know why this is. Gas changes volume depending on temperature, and pressure. The relationship between volume and temperature is Charles's law which is at constant pressure a given mass of gas's volume increases as a factor of its temperature. Basically as it gets hotter its volume increases. The equation is V/T=k.\nV- volume\nT- temperature\nk- constant\nCharles's law must be done in Kelvin because it is an direct variation.\nThe other law is Boyle's law which shows the relationship between pressure and volume. The law states that at a constant temperature a give mass of gas's volume decreases as pressure goes up. The equation is PV=k\nP- pressure\nV- volume\nk- constant\nGay-Lussac's law states the relationship between pressure and temperature. Again it must be done in Kelvin, since its a direct variation. In simple words it states as pressure increases so does temperature. the equation is P/T=k.\nP- pressure\nT- temperature\nk- constant\nYou can combine all three of those laws to get the combine gas law. Its equation is PV/T=k. To use this with stoichiometry you need to combine it with one last law, which is Avogadro's law. It states that at constant temperature and pressure equal volumes of gas contain the same number of moles. The equation is V/n=k\nV- volume\nn- moles\nk- constant\nWhen all four of these laws are combined together they make the ideal gas law. The equation for that (this is the important part since we will be using it for stoichiometry) is PV=nRT.\nR is the constant. The number changes depending on what units you measure it in. The basic outline of the units is PV/nT. I will be using the units kPa*L/n*K.\nkPa- kilo Pascals\nL- liters\nn- moles\nK- Kelvin\nThe n*K part will never change since the temperature must be measured in Kelvin and there are no other units for moles. The constant I am using is 8.314 L*kPa/n*K. To make it easier to solve stoichiometry problems arrange the equation\nso it looks like this PV/8.314*K.\nNow on to the actually stoichiometry. Nothing is really different just a different equation.\nHere is an example using the reaction between oxygen and iron to produce ferric oxide.\nYou have 5L. of oxygen in a lab that is 300 Kelvin and 22kPa.

When doing doing stoichiometry with solutions you need to know the concentration of reactants in your solvent. Specifically you need to know the moles per unit of solvent. There are many different ways of doing this, but I'm going to use molarity. Molarity is simply moles per liter.\u00a0\nTo find molarity of a solution we use n/L=M (M stands for molarity). To use it for stoichiometry arrange it so it looks like M*L=n.\nI'm going to describe how to make a 50mL. .75 molarity solution of NaCl in water. First start by doing the math.\n.75*.05 = .0375 moles\nSo I need .0375 moles of salt. Do the math to find what that is in grams.\n.0375*28 = 1.05g of salt\nNext is to make the actual solution. Start by filling a graduated cylinder with around 40mL of water. Now add the salt and let it completely dissolve. Finally add water up to 50mL.\nAlways when making a solution using molarity use less solvent then what you want the final solution to be dissolve the solute and then add the solvent to the final amount. This is because the solute takes up space too; if you add the solute to the measured amount of solvent it would come out as taking up more volume then you want, and you will have the wrong molarity.\nUsing solutions is great for chemical reactions, since it speeds them up. This is because the solvent breaks apart the ionic bonds of reactants. Besides that is also allows more atoms to get close enough to react. Since the solvent breaks apart the ionic compounds the chemical equation must be wrote different to reflect this.\nExample:\nAgNO3 + NaCl -->\u00a0 NaNO3 + AgCl\nWhen dissolved in a solvent it would look like this:\nAg+(aq) + NO3- (aq) + Na+ (aq) + Cl-(aq) --> AgCl (s) + NO3- (aq) + Na+ (aq)\nSince the NO3- + Na+ don't participate in the reaction they can be removed.\u00a0 The equation would look like this.\nAg+(aq) + Cl-(aq) --> AgCl(s)\nThe letters in parenthesis represent the state the substance is in\n(s)- solid\n(l)- liquid\n(g)- gas\n(aq)- aqueous or in solution\nHere is an example of solution stoichiometry using the reaction above.\nYou have 4L of 10 molarity solution of AgNO3.

It is a member of the halogen group on the periodic table and is a highly reactive nonmetallic element and oxidizing agent that readily forms compounds (notably oxides) with most elements.Photosynthesis releases oxygen, and respiration consumes oxygen. Changes in phosphate are related to changes in oxygen concentrations.Oxygen was discovered independently by Carl Wilhelm Schele, in Upsala, in 1773 or earlier, and Joseph Priestley in Wiltshire, in 1774, but Priestley is often given priority because his work was published first. The name oxygen was coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier,whose experiments with oxygen helped to discredit the then-popular phlogiston theory of combustion and corrosion. Its name derives from the Greek roots oxys, \"acid\", literally \"sharp\", referring to the sour taste of acids and -\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03ae\u03c2 -genes, \"producer\", literally \"begetter\", because at the time of naming, it was mistakenly thought that all acids required oxygen in their composition.Two major methods are employed to produce 100 million tonnes of O2 extracted from air for industrial uses annually.The most common method is to fractionally distill liquefied air into its various components, with N 2 distilling as a vapor while O 2 is left as a liquid.The other major method of producing O 2 gas involves passing a stream of clean, dry air through one bed of a pair of identical zeolite molecular sieves, which absorbs the nitrogen and delivers a gas stream that is 90% to 93% O 2.Simultaneously, nitrogen gas is released from the other nitrogen-saturated zeolite bed, by reducing the chamber operating pressure and diverting part of the oxygen gas from the producer bed through it, in the reverse direction of flow. After a set cycle time the operation of the two beds is interchanged, thereby allowing for a continuous supply of gaseous oxygen to be pumped through a pipeline. This is known as pressure swing adsorption. Oxygen gas is increasingly obtained by these non-cryogenic technologies (see also the related vacuum swing adsorption).Oxygen gas can also be produced through electrolysis of water into molecular oxygen and hydrogen. DC electricity must be used: if AC is used, the gases in each limb consist of hydrogen and oxygen in the explosive ratio 2:1. Contrary to popular belief, the 2:1 ratio observed in the DC electrolysis of acidified water does not prove that the empirical formula of water is H2O unless certain assumptions are made about the molecular formulae of hydrogen and oxygen themselves. A similar method is the electrocatalytic O 2 evolution from oxides andoxoacids. Chemical catalysts can be used as well, such as in chemical oxygen generators or oxygen candles that are used as part of the life-support equipment on submarines, and are still part of standard equipment on commercial airliners in case of depressurization emergencies. Another air separation technology involves forcing air to dissolve through ceramic membranes based on zirconium dioxideby either high pressure or an electric current, to produce nearly pure O 2 gas.In large quantities, the price of liquid oxygen in 2001 was approximately $0.21/kg.Since the primary cost of production is the energy cost of liquefying the air, the production cost will change as energy cost varies.                                                                               HydrogenHydrogen is a chemical element with chemical symbol H and atomic number 1. With an atomic weight of 1.00794 u, hydrogen is the lightest element on the periodic table. Its monatomic form (H) is the most abundant chemical substance in the universe, constituting roughly 75% of all baryonic mass.Non-remnant stars are mainly composed of hydrogen in its plasma state. The most common isotope of hydrogen, termed protium (name rarely used, symbol 1H), has one proton and no neutrons.The universal emergence of atomic hydrogen first occurred during the recombination epoch. At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, nonmetallic, highly combustible diatomic gas with the molecular formula H2. Since hydrogen readily forms covalent compounds with most non-metallic elements, most of the hydrogen on Earth exists in molecular forms such as in the form of water or organic compounds. Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid\u2013base reactions as many acid-base reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of a negative charge when it is known as a hydride, or as a positively charged species denoted by the symbol H+. The hydrogen cation is written as though composed of a bare proton, but in reality, hydrogen cations in ionic compounds are always more complex species than that would suggest. As the only neutral atom for which the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be solved analytically,study of the energetics and bonding of the hydrogen atom has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics. Hydrogen gas was first artificially produced in the early 16th century, via the mixing of metals with acids. In 1766\u201381, Henry Cavendish was the first to recognize that hydrogen gas was a discrete substance,and that it produces water when burned, a property which later gave it its name: in Greek, hydrogen means \"water-former\". Industrial production is mainly from the steam reforming of natural gas, and less often from more energy-intensive hydrogen production methods like the electrolysis of water.Most hydrogen is employed near its production site, with the two largest uses being fossil fuel processing and ammonia production, mostly for the fertilizer market. Hydrogen is a concern in metallurgy as it can embrittle many metals,complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanksIn the laboratory, H2 is usually prepared by the reaction of dilute non-oxidizing acids on some reactive metals such as zinc with Kipp's apparatus. Zn + 2 H+  \u2192 Zn2+  + H 2Aluminium can also produce H 2 upon treatment with bases: 2 Al + 6 H 2O + 2 OH\u2212  \u2192 2 Al(OH)\u2212 4 + 3 H 2The electrolysis of water is a simple method of producing hydrogen. A low voltage current is run through the water, and gaseous oxygen forms at the anode while gaseous hydrogen forms at the cathode. Typically the cathode is made from platinum or another inert metal when producing hydrogen for storage. If, however, the gas is to be burnt on site, oxygen is desirable to assist the combustion, and so both electrodes would be made from inert metals. (Iron, for instance, would oxidize, and thus decrease the amount of oxygen given off.) The theoretical maximum efficiency (electricity used vs. energetic value of hydrogen produced) is in the range 80\u201394%.2 H 2O(l) \u2192 2 H 2(g) + O 2(g)In 2007, it was discovered that an alloy of aluminium and gallium in pellet form added to water could be used to generate hydrogen. The process also creates alumina, but the expensive gallium, which prevents the formation of an oxide skin on the pellets, can be re-used. This has important potential implications for a hydrogen economy, as hydrogen can be produced on-site and does not need to be transported.                                                                               ChlorineChlorine is a chemical element with symbol Cl and atomic number 17. Chlorine is in the halogen group and is the second lightest halogen following fluorine. The element is a yellow-green gas under standard conditions, where it forms diatomic molecules. Chlorine has the highest electron affinity and the third highest electronegativity of all the reactive elements. For this reason, chlorine is a strong oxidizing agent. Free chlorine is rare on Earth, and is usually a result of direct or indirect oxidation byoxygen.The most common compound of chlorine, sodium chloride (common salt), has been known since ancient times. Around 1630, chlorine gas was first synthesized in a chemical reaction, but not recognized as a fundamentally important substance. Characterization of chlorine gas was made in 1774 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, who supposed it to be an oxide of a new element. In 1809, chemists suggested that the gas might be a pure element, and this was confirmed by Sir Humphry Davy in 1810, who named it from Ancient Greek\"pale green\". Nearly all chlorine in the Earth's crust occurs as chloride in various ionic compounds, including table salt. It is the second most abundant halogen and 21st most abundant chemical element in Earth's crust. Elemental chlorine is commercially produced frombrine by electrolysis. The high oxidizing potential of elemental chlorine led commercially to free chlorine's bleaching and disinfectant uses, as well as its many uses of an essential reagent in the chemical industry. Chlorine is used in the manufacture of a wide range of consumer products, about two-thirds of them organic chemicals such as polyvinyl chloride, as well as many intermediates for production of plastics and other end products which do not contain the element. As a common disinfectant, elemental chlorine and chlorine-generating compounds are used more directly in swimming pools to keep them clean and sanitary. In the form of chloride ions, chlorine is necessary to all known species of life. Other types of chlorine compounds are rare in living organisms, and artificially produced chlorinated organics range from inert to toxic. In the upper atmosphere, chlorine-containing organic molecules such as chlorofluorocarbons have been implicated in ozone depletion. Small quantities of elemental chlorine are generated by oxidation of chloride to hypochlorite in neutrophils, as part of the immune response against bacteria. Elemental chlorine at high concentrations is extremely dangerous and poisonous for all living organisms, and was used in World War I as the first gaseous chemical warfare agent.In industry, elemental chlorine is usually produced by the electrolysis of sodium chloride dissolved in water. This method, the chloralkali process industrialized in 1892, now provides essentially all industrial chlorine gas.Along with chlorine, the method yields hydrogen gas and sodium hydroxide (with sodium hydroxide actually being the most crucial of the three industrial products produced by the process). The process proceeds according to the following chemical equation:2 NaCl + 2 H2O \u2192 Cl2 + H2 + 2 NaOHThe electrolysis of chloride solutions all proceed according to the following equations: Cathode: 2 H+(aq) + 2 e\u2212 \u2192 H2(g)Anode: 2 Cl\u2212(aq) \u2192 Cl2(g) + 2 e\u2212Overall process: 2 NaCl (or KCl) + 2 H2O \u2192 Cl2 + H2 + 2 NaOH (or KOH) In diaphragm cell electrolysis, an asbestos (or polymer-fiber) diaphragm separates a cathode and an anode, preventing the chlorine forming at the anode from re-mixing with the sodium hydroxide and the hydrogen formed at the cathode.The salt solution (brine) is continuously fed to the anode compartment and flows through the diaphragm to the cathode compartment, where the caustic alkali is produced and the brine is partially depleted. Diaphragm methods produce dilute and slightly impure alkali but they are not burdened with the problem of preventing mercury discharge into the environment and they are more energy efficient. Membrane cell electrolysis employ permeable membrane as an ion exchanger. Saturated sodium (or potassium) chloride solution is passed through the anode compartment, leaving at a lower concentration.This method is more efficient than the diaphragm cell and produces very pure sodium (or potassium) hydroxide at about 32% concentration, but requires very pure brine.", "title": "Make Hydrogen,Oxygen and Chlorine", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Make-HydrogenOxygen-And-Chlorine/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Hydrogen can be made in several waysZinc + Hydrochloric Acid \u2192 Zinc Chloride + Hydrogen(s) + 2HCl (l) \u2192 ZnCl2 (l)+ H2 (g)Aluminium + Sodium Hydroxide \u2192 Hydrogen + Sodium AluminateOr by electrolysing water,baking soda solution or salt.Cheapest,Easiest and the Safest methods are method 2 and 3Lets do method 2Chemicals and things to do thisA plastic beaker,use plastic only do not use glass or NaOH will eat it.Aluminium sheets or foil(sheets are good)NaOH wich is also known as washing sodaWaterA matchA clean work place.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FHF/2BP0/IDRP8WA4/FHF2BP0IDRP8WA4.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: How to Make Hydrogen"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Put water and washing soda togetherThen put some aluminium stripsnow let it react and slowly make a long match shown as the picture", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ0/N3UL/IDRP8X31/FQ0N3ULIDRP8X31.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Put All Together"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Fire the match and slowly move it to the gasNow you can hear the sound of hydrogen........POP!!!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWS/OJ3Y/IDRP8X6V/FWSOJ3YIDRP8X6V.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2V/12TS/IDRP8X6W/F2V12TSIDRP8X6W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE0/PSV1/IDRP8X70/FE0PSV1IDRP8X70.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Burn It!!"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "                                                                         Danger Chlorine is Poisonous!!!Ways to make chlorineHCl + O2 \u2192 2 Cl2 + 2 H2ONaCl + H2SO4 + MnO2 \u2192 Na2SO4 + MnSO4 + 2 H2O + Cl2KMNO4 + HCl = KCl + MNCl2 + H2O + Cl2We will try the third method which is easy and cheapChemicals and Equipment RequiredA beakerPotassium permanganate (KMnO4)HCl (Hydrochloric Acid)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FU8/TNMJ/IDRP8XCK/FU8TNMJIDRP8XCK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: How to Make Chlorine"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Here you can see a bubble of chlorine!!!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FYW/D2OB/IDRP8YNH/FYWD2OBIDRP8YNH.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: React It!"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Just mix hydrogen peroxide with potassium permanganateOr mix sulfuric acid with potassium permanganate or manganese oxide which is found inside batteries                                                                                                                                          Thanks for reading                                                                                                                                        sorry for bad quality                                                                                                                                  p;ease request for more and comment!!!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FD3/6VN5/IDRP8YRA/FD36VN5IDRP8YRA.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: How to Make Oxygen"}], "channel": "Science"}, {"category": "technology", "description": "It is a reaction between 50% Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and Potassium permanganate (KMnO4) .

An oxidation reaction involves the loss of electrons. A reduction reaction involves a substance gaining electrons. Because of the extra emphasis on electrons, balancing a redox reaction is slightly different than balancing a standard reaction. Luckily, it still follows a fairly simple set of rules. This instructable will hopefully serve to guide and illustrate how to balance a redox reaction.Requirements:Writing UtensilA redox reaction to balanceA small amount of chemistry know-how ", "title": "How to Balance a Redox Reaction", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Balance-a-Redox-Reaction/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "In this example, we have a reaction of Methanol and Chromium Trioxide.

A good rule of thumb when determining whether a particular molecule is being reduced or oxidized is looking at the oxygen(s) attached to it. The chromium trioxide in this reaction is turned into Cr +4. Since it lost some oxygen, we can call it \"reduced\". In the methanol, a double bond was formed between the carbon and the oxygen. Since the carbon gained an additional bond to oxygen, we can say it was \"oxidized\". Granted this rule of thumb doesn't actually fit the strict definitions of reduction and oxidation, but it's useful when one is pressed for time.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ2/P9BY/I0C90J0A/FJ2P9BYI0C90J0A.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Splitting the Reaction"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "The next step will be to balance all the elements besides oxygen and hydrogen.

The best way to make the groove I found was to use the side of a small, thin file. Put the rod into a drill and secure the drill in a vice. Push the side of the file against the aluminium rod and move it up and down slowly. Take your time and don\u2019t go too deep or wide. The groove should only be as wide as the O ring. 4. Stop and check regularly. Once you have an even groove, remove the rod from the drill and add the O ring to the groove. If the O ring sits even in the groove, then you are ready to see if it fits into the tube. HERE\u2019S THE IMPORTANT BIT. Make sure you add a little bit of oil to the O ring. This will ensure that it moves easily and smoothly inside the tube. I didn\u2019t do this initially and my O ring kept on getting stuck inside. 5. To test you need to push the rod into the tube. You should feel a \u201ccushion\u201d of compressed air as you push the rod down. This will force the rod to bounce back up again. If you find that the rod isn\u2019t bouncing back, or that it\u2019s too hard to push into the tube, then you will either need to make the groove larger or start again.

This is NOT an instructable for kids! This is for educational purposes and if you attempt this you are doing so at your own risk. I am not responsible if you get hurt attempting this. The responsibility for your safety depends on you! I try to discuss how to do this safely throughout the instructable so, READ EVERYTHING CAREFULLY, but realize I can't think of every safety problem. HAVE A FIRE EXTINGUISHER HANDY! If you do not have a high level of understanding of the chemistry and physics involved you really should not do this. That said, science and learning without danger would yield no cars, no fireworks, and no disease cures. So, I'm going to donate my body to some dangerous science! Maybe some of you experienced a common flame test lab in high school. The one where you try to identify the presence of different metals by dipping little sticks in alcohol mixed with salts and observing what color the solution burns. This is basically like that on super soldier serum. This little baby can shoot up to 5 feet of flame and shoot two colors at once (three colors are possible if blending the fire streams). This thing can produce impressive flames for up to twenty seconds. To me, that's pretty sweet for a pocket-sized flamethrower holding maybe 20 grams of fuel.BUT CAN'T THE FLAME GET SUCKED INTO THE CANISTER AND BLOW UP?! No. In this case the fuel canister is made safe with self pressurizing butane fuel. In order to have fire you need fuel and an oxidizing agent such as O2 (makes up ~20% of air) or N2O(nitrous oxide) or one of many other oxidizing agents (oxygen may not even be involved). Since the canister is full of fuel with no oxidizer, it is not going to explode. If this were not the case, bic and other butane lighters would all be potential grenades in your hands. Their fuel sprays directly from where it is stored, into the flame. Some may say, but I've seen videos of lighters turned into little explosives. True and this could blast fire everywhere too if the plastic canisters melt and release the fuel. The container can explode if there is a second hole in the container, as this could cause air to get sucked up into it. You still have to be careful here. To achieve colored fires another fuel, 100% denatured alcohol, is added to various fire coloring ionic compounds and mixed in with the butane. Some of these ionic compounds are toxic (very small amounts are used though), as is denatured alcohol. Yet another reason to be cautious. Why do the chemicals used produce color? As the metals in the ionic compounds get hot, their electrons get bumped up to a more excited orbital state. It is an electron's nature to not want to stay in this excited state. So, to go back to the way it was, it rids itself of energy in the form of light. Due to different metals having electrons in different orbital states, the different metal's electrons emit different colors of light when excited. Since the alcohol and butane don't really emit much visible light, when burned efficiently, (like with the high pressure nozzle used here that mixes in a lot of oxygen with the fuel ) you see the colors emitted by the metals clearly. How does it fire? I just simply push the little clear plastic tabs down onto the butane tanks' valves and out comes the pressurized fuel over a flaming pilot light wick. Each tab activates one tank making multiple colored blasts possible. Make sure to read all the picture notes too. You can't be a convincing pyromancer/pyrokinetic without fire!

Don't use vinyl tubing for this. Vinyl tubing gets rigid and leaks at the nozzles when the super cold butane comes out of the canisters. Rapidly expanding gases cause cooling (the tubes will feel as cold as ice when operating this device). It's the same principal that makes a refrigerator work. Nitro line is made from silicone and is somewhat fire resistant and does not get rigid in the cold. Check and be absolutely sure that the nitro line you use stays on the butane tank nozzle. If the diameter of your hose is too big it will just get blown off or slip off. The stuff I used is said to be 2 mm internal diameter, but close observation with digital calipers puts it more at 2.3 mm. I tried this with some 2.6 mm internal diameter silicone hose and it did not stay on as well. I used a 50' spool of Du-BRO (2239). You can buy shorter 2 ft sections sold as Du-BRO 2231 and it also comes in lots of colors. The stuff I used was perfect; the silicone makes it grab and stay on the nozzle very well. Just make sure there is no fluid on the nozzle when you slip it on.\u00a0 Always be watchful so you don't spray yourself with flammable fluid. I have not yet had this happen to me, despite heavy use of this thing. The tubing for the firing nozzle (referring here to the part that actually shoots the flame) that I really liked is made of brass. The aluminum stuff its too bendy. One of the most important things to achieving good colored flames is having a high pressure tiny nozzle. If you spray too much liquid that is not aersolized well, it will just burn the same color as an ordinary flame. In order for the colors to show, the fuel must mix well with air to burn completely. Cut the hose and round brass tube to size as seen in the pics. Crush the end of the tube with needle-nose pliers to make a very small opening for fuel to shoot out.

I only use about a gram or fraction of a gram of ionic compounds for about every 100 mL of denatured alcohol because it takes very little to get color and more may just clog up your nozzle. Plus, some of these ionic compounds are toxic, but rather small amounts are used. Don't use methanol alcohol (Heet). It works, but it's more toxic and allows whatever is mixed with it to diffuse through your skin. The methanol itself also goes right through your skin. It's a lot more toxic than ethanol (the alcohol in booze). There is some methanol (or a similar substance) in denatured alcohol (in some cases >10% methanol), hence why I wear the nitrile gloves when mixing this stuff. Denatured alcohol largely contains ethanol. They put something toxic like methanol and bitter substances in denatured alcohol to discourage people from drinking it (to keep sales costs down by avoiding liquor tax). Read all the included material and safety data sheets on the chemicals being used here so you know what is going on with them. My friend and I accidentally spilled a couple of ounces of methanol and boric acid on our arms while teaming up to make a large green flamethrower (which worked great). We promptly washed it off with water, but felt a weird tingling sensation on the surface of our arms for a few hours afterwards. I don't think it was good for us, but we survived. Just be careful with these chemicals and work only with small amounts. Methanol can actually cause blindness and according to the Nation Institutes of Health, \"As little as 2 tablespoons can be deadly to a child. About 2 to 8 ounces can be deadly for an adult.\" I can't say that I completely know what all the products are that are produced by burning all of this stuff together. A mix of butane, denatured alcohol (which can be a mix of several things), and ionic compounds burning in air comprises a lot of chemical reactions occurring at once. In a standard scaled down version of this that a teacher would conduct in a chem lab, a butane burner may be used to burn these ionic compounds mixed with methanol alcohol, but a very small amount is used. I'm burning a big cloud of this stuff. So, there is a certain unknown risk in all this to be aware of. Isopropyl rubbing alcohol will have crappy performance even at 99 percent purity. It doesn't burn clear enough for the colors to show through well. Copper chloride is not a good colorant to use here since it is rather corrosive to metal and may wreck the seals on the butane tanks. I use copper acetate instead. I also avoid lithium salts. They look cool (magenta), but they're not so great for you. Links for Material and Safety data sheets.

The completely empty tanks can be put in the pocket flamethrower tank holder to make filling with the alcohol and colorant solution easier. Attach the hose snugly to the top of the mini butane refill tank nozzle. The lever on the nozzle simply needs to be pushed down and the fluid can be injected in. The container must be emptied of butane or else it will be very hard to push the fluid in and it may just wind up spraying everywhere. You can fill the butane tanks with this liquid anywhere from very little to 3/4 full. I've found that adding more tends to make the fire last longer, but doesn't make it that much more colorful. The more alcohol you have the more likely it is for the flaming liquid to make it to the ground rather than burning up in the air. This is due to the fact that butane burns up more readily. This of course makes it more dangerous for you as it keeps burning whatever gets sprayed longer.\u00a0 I attached a small section of hose to the fill nozzle of the large butane refill canister that will be filling the little ones. The other end of the hose was attached to the nozzle of the little canister. The section of hose must be long enough to seal both nozzles well to prevent fuel leaking out, but short enough to not kink. Press the big canister strait down into the other one and make sure the hose isn't getting pinched and that the nozzles aren't bending. Again, make sure to use safety glasses! I plan on retiring these little butane canisters after a couple dozen refills since they were never designed for being refilled and I don't know how many times one can do this without them starting to leak. I have yet to see any of the 9 containers I have spring a leak despite over a dozen fills with each. Always check for leaks though.

Purify (a liquid) by vaporizing it, then condensing it by cooling the vapor, and collecting the resulting liquid.\n2. Make (something, esp. liquor or an essence) in this way.\nDistillation is the method of separating a mixture into its component parts by use of the difference in their boiling points. It normally involves heating the mixture to a temperature at some point just over the boiling point of one, but well below the boiling point of the other. This makes the first one boil off, where it can be collected or discarded, and leaves the other in the original container. The method is often used in oil refinery (fractional distillation is used to split out the different compounds in crude oil) and in liquor and alcoholic beverage creation (to adjust the alcohol content).\nDistillation is the one way to clean and purify most water (killing water borne pathogens and even removing most salt from the water).\u00a0LAWS: Within the United States, it is ILLEGAL to distill any kind of alcohol without a license.\n\u00a0WARNINGS:\u00a0\n1. this is for informational purposes only and should not be used for illegal activities.\n2.
