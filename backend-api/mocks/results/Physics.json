I will, however explain the flow of electricity to you can get a better understanding.The electricity flows from an electrical outlet into the two leads of the transformer (polarity does not matter, just make sure you know which side of the transformer is the input and which is the output). Then, converted from 120VAC to 13.5VAC, it flows through a bridge rectifier circuit with the capacitor (see the second image, courtesy of Wikipedia). The bridge rectifier changes the AC voltage into a pulsating DC voltage with a + and - , and the capacitor (wired as shown, make sure you wire the + to + and the - to -!!!!!) filters the current to smooth out the pulses into a constant flow of electricity. From here, the negative lead goes to the first switch's middle prong. One of the other prongs is then connected to the middle prong of the other two switches, as well as to an LED with a resistor (resistance will vary depending on your transformer). This LED is then connected directly to the + lead of the capacitor, making a circuit.Moving on to the second switch. Wire one of the outer prongs of the switch to the - lead of the Peltier unit and wire the + lead directly to the + lead of the capacitor. Wire this same prong to another LED and resistor (make sure you've got the correct polarity on the LED: the notched or flat side is usually negative). Then wire the + lead of the LED to, you guessed it, the + lead of the capacitor. The center prong of this switch should be connected to the first switch.Finally, the last switch. The middle prong is connected to the other two switches. Connect the - lead of one fan to an outer prong and the - lead of the other fan to the remaining prong.

Try to put the transformer as close to the end of the box as possible.\rI don't have a picture, but if you look at the 2nd picture, you can see how I cut a (really crappy) hole in the box for the fan. Just use the biggest hole saw you have and then slowly make it bigger by using smaller hole saw bits until it gets to be the size of the fan. Also, drill a couple smaller holes for screws to hold the fan in.\rCut a small hole in the back (opposite the transformer) of the box for the two leads of the thinner fan, then run them through and solder. Make sure you cut the hole BEFORE soldering, otherwise you'll just have to unsolder the connections to run it through. You could also cut a small slit in the box where the lid connects to just set the wires in, but it won't look as pretty.\rNext, cut a rectangular hole JUST the size of the Peltier cooler in the top of the box (not the lid!). You might have to cut a couple slits for the leads to rest in as well. Make sure that the side that gets hot is facing away from the box and the cold side is facing in.\rWhile you're looking at the top of the box, cut three holes for the toggle switches (mine were 1/4\") and try to make them in a straight line, equidistant from each other. Drill a couple of smaller holes for the LED's as well. I put these holes next to the 1st and 2nd switch.\rDrill a few holes in the transformer side of the box for some air flow past the components.

You want to place it so that it's blowing INTO the case (there should be some arrows in the plastic near where the wires connect to show you how the air flows. You might have to cut off all the other plastic tabs on the fan to make it fit against the side of the box and mesh with the component board. Using a couple small screws that fit in the holes in the fan (and in the holes you cut in the box), attach the fan and a fan grill. You'll probably only be able to attach 2 screws. Then, using some needle-nosed pliers, bend the two remaining \"arms\" on the fan grill 90 degrees to make little feet. These will hold the fan up off the surface its on so it will be able to get decent air flow.\rNext!\rUsing some thermal tape or thermal compound, attach the heatsink to the top of the Peltier unit. The heatsink basically just rests on top of the case. I used thermal tape to hold things together, but if you use thermal compound, you'll probably have to engineer some sort of brace system to hold them together.\rCut a piece of thin plastic (3rd picture) to use (1) to prevent a short circuit between the transformer and a switch and (2) to prevent all your chilled air from blowing past the hot components and coming out hot. Some air will be blown past them to cool it a bit, but not as much as there would have if the plastic was not in place. You'll need to tinker around with cutting sections out of the plastic for the wires to go through.\rJust sort of place the PC board as close to the side of the case as possible so that the fan will fit. Make sure there aren't any short circuits! You can add a bit of hot glue to keep it on the side, but I find that the fan pushing against it works well enough. Plus, I was out of hot glue.\rAnd....\rFinally, grab your AC plug with a cable, strip the wires inside as well as the wires to the transformer, insulate everything, and solder the one wire form the transformer to one wire of the plug.

When you flip the third switch, the other fan should start spinning instead. Now flip the second switch. The other LED should light, and the first LED will probably dim. The fan will slow down as well. This lets you know that the Peltier unit is working. Place your hand on the heatsink. Within a minute, you should start to feel it get warm.

Once the whole is drilled try to empty out as many of the shards of metal that might have got into the torch as possible. Then counter sink or file don this hole so it has smooth edges. Preparing the spoutWhen you take the spout section of the blowtorch off there will be a piece of metal that looks like a heating element attached to the back plate. This is also attached to the nut that goes on top of the oil reserve and the tube that goes into the oil reserve. Often this is soldered and screwed on to the back plate. First undo the screw holding this in place, in the case of the blow torch I was using I had to use pliers because the screw had no where for a screwdriver to fit. Now use the dremel to cut away the solder holding the tube that goes into the oil reserve until it and the heating element come away.

If you\u2019re not convinced, look at the power usage of electric appliances like microwaves, space heaters, water heaters, ovens, or coffee pots. The difference can be seen between your electric bill from a cold month, when you have to continually run your central heating, and during summer months, when the ambient temperature does not need to be heated.If you live off-grid, you tend to be far more aware of what it takes to create electricity; you can literally watch your batteries\u2019 voltage drop lower and lower when using an inefficient appliance. However, if you are tied into the grid, you should almost be extra vigilant as regards your power usage. Not only do you have to pay for it each month, but also the power plants that produce your electricity are rarely sustainable or environmentally conscious. When considering the issue of heat, there are several green options, the best of which is the sun. Solar thermal energy can be harnessed in many ways to heat your water, food, or home. For the purpose of this article, we will be concentrating on an active thermal space heater to heat a room or house. The unit takes one person two days to construct, one day to install, and costs under $100. The temperature inside the unit easily reaches 160 degrees Fahrenheit on a 50-degree day, and can be blown into the house using a fan that pulls less electricity than a light bulb. Please note that the unit should be installed on a south facing wall (if that is not possible, then a west facing wall will at least give you heat in the afternoon).An additional advantage for rural Mexico is that the production of these units can create a local business. A couple of people could start making them with very few tools and initial outlay. Any new business in a rural area will increase the wealth of that community, as there will be more money being circulated locally. Furthermore, people can apply to their municipal\u2019s Presidency for aid in putting them in schools and community buildings, to reduce the amount of firewood that parents have to provide.

If you can find one of these that uses 110 VAC, then you don\u2019t need anything else. Most small fans of this type are 12 VDC, which means that you need a converter from 110 VAC to 12 VDC. These converters are readily available from junk or surplus electronics, and are commonly referred to as \u201cwall warts.\u201d The converter should output at least 12 volts DC, and double the amps your fan is rated for. This gives enough room for the fan\u2019s startup surge.SIZE OF PLASTICThe first problem you may encounter is the size of your transparent, corrugated plastic. If you can find a 4 feet sheet, so much the better, as that will match the size that the insulation comes in. However, if you can only find a 3 feet wide piece, don\u2019t worry. You can still use this design, but you will have to cut your insulation down to fit it, and then adjust the metal channel walls, so that they too match the new size.HEIGHT OF THE ROOMThe next issue is the inside height of your room. You will have two holes through your south facing wall, one at the top and one at the bottom. Air will be drawn from the bottom hole into the bottom of the heating unit outside. This is because it will take less energy to heat the air from inside the house than from outside, as it will already be warmer than the external temperature. The air that has been heated by the unit will then blow down into the room from the top hole. The problem with this is that, in order to make the most out of your heater, you will want the distance between the outside edges of the two holes to be about 8 feet (a little less is OK).If your room is eight feet tall, construction of the unit will be easier, cheaper and more efficient. Easier, because you will be able to cut a hole through the bottom and top of the heater\u2019s backing (insulation), instead of having to go out through the sides of the heater\u2019s wall, which is more complicated. Cheaper, because you will need less 4\u201d dryer vent, as it will be going straight through the house\u2019s wall, instead of having to curve to the side before going inside. More efficient, because the temperature inside the unit will match the air coming into the room, whereas if you have to go to the side, you will lose a little heat through the extra dryer vent. You can compensate for this by painting the exposed vent black, or, even better, wrap it with insulation.During the course of this article, we will be mostly describing how to attach this unit to a smaller room. For a start, it is probably more common to have rooms that are less than eight feet tall. Secondly, it is more complicated, and therefore requires a little more explanation. However, wherever the instructions differ for a tall room, we will add notes in bold.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 2: Considerations"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Mark a piece of 10 ft. metal channel at 104\u201d from one end (8\u2019 8\u201d).Using the tin snips cut off the remaining 16\u201d and put it aside for now. Measure and mark 4\u201d in from each end of the 104\u201d channel. Cut the sides of the channel off along these 4\u201d parts, leaving a 4\u201d tab on each end of an 8 feet length of channel.

The ends near the B tabs want to be \u00bd\u201d in from the inside edge, so that when the two channels are side by side, the molding from one channel will be close to the other at the B end. The insulation (which is \u00bd\u201d thick) will eventually slot into this \u00bd\u201d space. The other end of the molding, near the T end of the channels, wants to be 1\u201d from the outside edges. This is where the corrugated plastic will eventually slip in. Once you have the molding tightly clamped to the metal, turn the metal over and screw it into the wood (through the metal). You may need to pre-drill through the metal. Your screws should be every 12\u201d or so.   Turn the two channels up on their sides, facing each other, so that the molding that is \u00bd\u201d in from the side is on the bottom. Place the insulation in between the channels, slipping it inside the metal and the bottom molding. With the 1\u201d wood screws, screw it in place using the holes you pre-drilled in the previous section, going through the metal and into the side of the insulation. Cut a piece of molding, 47\u201d long (this is the width of the insulation, 48\u201d, minus the thickness of the two side pieces of molding, \u00bd\u201d each). Place this 47\u201d piece inside the two side pieces of molding, in roughly the center of their 8 ft. length, and screw it in place. Paint the whole inside black.[If you have an 8 ft. tall room, as described in Step 1:Considerations, you will need to do the following steps at this stage: 11. Cut two 4\u201d holes through the insulation (you can put your 4\u201d dryer vent in place against the insulation and draw around it to get the right size). One hole needs to be in the center at the top, with its top 2\u201d down from the edge, and the other in the center at the bottom, with its bottom 2\u201d up from the edge. The distance between the top of the first hole and the bottom of the second hole should be 92\u201d. 12. If the unit can fit inside the house, place the unit up against the wall where you want it to go, and mark the two holes, through the insulation, onto your wall. 13. If the unit doesn\u2019t quite fit inside the room, but almost, drill a hole through the wall from the inside, a little up from the floor. Make sure you drill straight, not sloping up or down. 14. Then drill another hole through the wall, exactly 92\u201d straight up from the first, but near the ceiling. 15. Hold your unit up on the outside of the wall, so that the very bottom of the bottom circle is just below the drilled hole, and the very top of the top circle lines up with the top drilled hole.

The principals are the same, but solid concrete walls, for example, will be a lot harder than adobe, and will take you longer. If you have loose fill inside your walls, you will have to be prepared to support the fill as you chip out the wall, as they do in mines, so that the fill doesn\u2019t all fall into the room.This step is likely to make a mess, so it\u2019s a good idea to put sheets over your furniture against dust, and tarps on the floor for the chunks. If you have an 8 ft. tall room, you will already have marked your holes on the wall (in the section headed \u201cInsulation Box\u201d). If you have a short room, you will need to mark your walls now. Know roughly where your panel will be hung, as these holes will be to one side of it. On the inside of your room, hold a piece of dryer vent up to the wall close to the floor (about 1\u201d or 2\u201d up from the bottom). Draw around the tube onto the wall. Do the same up near the ceiling. The two holes want to be in line with each other. Using a long masonry bit, drill some holes on the inside of the circles you have marked. Make sure you always drill straight, not angling up, down or to the sides. You can also drill some in the center. With a chisel and hammer, start tapping out the material of the wall. You want to go all around the circles you marked, and then the center. Once you have chipped out a circular tunnel as far as you can, you\u2019ll need to go to the other side of the wall and begin there. If your drill holes were straight, you should have a pretty good idea of where that circle is. If not, drill a hole through the center and look through it to make sure it is straight. Then draw a circle around this hole with a 2\u201d radius. When the two holes are complete, try putting your dryer hose into them. You will probably need to chip little bits out. Take your fan and center it over the top hole. If it is square or larger than the hole in any way, draw its shape onto the wall. Chip out this shape a little more than the thickness of the fan, so that it can sit inside the hole without any part of it sticking out. Your major mess making is now over. You can clean up the worst of it, just to get it out of the way, but don\u2019t worry about dusting the house just yet!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F44/CGA4/I6NI42A2/F44CGA4I6NI42A2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTB/Y25B/I6NI429Z/FTBY25BI6NI429Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV9/ZBBS/I6NI429I/FV9ZBBSI6NI429I.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Holes in the Walls"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "The unit will be almost upright, although the bottom wants to be held a couple of inches out from the wall and the top touching the wall.

The braces are more to protect it from wind damage. Cut the 1\u201d metal strip into two lengths of 12\u201d, two lengths of 10\u201d, and two lengths of 8\u201d.

It\u2019s a good idea to attach it by cutting a couple of 4\u201d x 1\u201d strips out of some left over channel, bending them into right angles, and then screwing one part of the \u201cL\u201d into the vent and the other part into the insulation. Put a bead of silicon all the way around the dryer vent. Do the same for the bottom hole, using the longer dryer vent. Now, as you put your heater onto the bottom wall braces, you will want to feed the dryer vents gently into the holes in the wall. This will require two people.] Lift your heater onto the bottom wall braces and center it over them.

Connect one wire of the extension to free wire of the snap switch, and the other wire to the fan. Skip to step 5. If you are using a converter, then cut the appliance-end adapter from the converter cord.  Plug the converter into a wall outlet, and with a multimeter, test the voltage coming from the converter.

Attach the positive to the free wire of the snap switch, and the negative to the negative of the fan. Plug the converter into the wall to test.  It should come on, if the solar heater is in direct sunlight.  If it does not come on, then unplug the converter, and wire the positive line from the converter directly to the fan\u2019s positive line.  Plug it in again to test.

Adapting the stand to the microscope turned out to be a easy job on the lathe. The ring light fit off the bat (I did measure my scope before buying so not a surprise.). But I was left without a light source. Looking on ebay for a matching source they ran from $75 to $300 depending on condition. Eventually I decided to just build my own. The official light sources typically use a halogen bulb. These are hot and have a useful life measured in the tens or hundreds of hours.

Most fiber light sources use a 150W Halogen lamp. In general these lamps put out around 1800 lumens @ 3200K color temp.\u00a0 Using this as the standard for the lamp a direct replacement would be a 20W led module with 1800 to 2200Lm @ 3000K. But the other thing to take in consideration is the cross section of the end of the fiber your going to drive. In my case the fiber has a active cross section of \u00a09mm circular. The 20W leds have a active area of ~18mm square. Without some sort of optics to focus the light on the end of the fiber a lot of the light would be lost. To start with I decided to go with a 10W led module. These have a active area of ~10mm so I should be able to butt up the end of the fiber to the output of the LED without optics with minimal loss. Also since I am building from scratch I chose a hotter color temperature of 6300-7000K which produces a more blue than yellow white. Personally I like the blue end of the spectrum when working on small projects. \u00a0Looking around on ebay I found a DC-LE14274 from sure electronics. This led is 900Lm @ 6300-700K when driven at 1050mA. My driver card will only go up to 1000mA but even at the reduced current and lumen output it was plenty bright for my ring light and scope.\u00a0Heat sink selection: Now that the LED is selected we know the max power dissipation the heat sink will need to handle. In my case 10W max. Since some of the power is converted to light the actually heat load is much less but for explanation simplicity I am going to call it 10W.\u00a0 There are many choices for heat sinks out there. The 2 most important issues are the amount of thermal mass and the surface area of the fins. The more thermal mass a heat sink has the longer it will take to heat up or cool down. The more surface area the fins have the faster air can remove the heat from the heat sink. Designing a heat sink is a complex engineering task with lots of trade offs. It can be as simple as a large bar of aluminum to as fancy as a multi metal finned heat sink with heat pipes. Digging around in my pile of junk I found a small ~91mmX79mmx75mm heat sink and fan off a old PC. Most modern CPUs run in the range of 50W to 300W so this should be overkill for my application.\u00a0 Note if your using a CPU heat sink and it has \"heat pipes\" (tubes running from the CPU mounting plate though the fins) you MUST make sure you will not drill any holes though them else the thermal fluid will leak out and greatly reduce the thermal efficiency of the heat sink. Also typically these heat sinks must be mounted with the CPU plate down. Other mounting orientations will result in reduced cooling efficiency.Fan or not to fan:\u00a0 The requirement of a fan is best decided experimentally. In my case the heat sink would get very warm (but not burning hot) after a half hour of use at full brightness with no fan. With the original 12V fan hooked up and running at 44% PWM (ie slowed down) the heat sink would stay cool to the touch after a half hour. For my application I don't think the fan was really needed since I only use it for short periods of time and it did not get significantly warm. But in the interest of the longest LED life I did end up adding the fan.\u00a0 Once your LED, Heat sink, and fan are selected I highly suggest modeling the devices in sketchup or similar CAD program. From this model you can design the mounting hardware and dimension all the parts for machining. Attached is the sketchup model for my LED light source minus the stand mounting brackets.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FB5/70G6/HO235U4Z/FB570G6HO235U4Z.LARGE.jpg", "/assets/img/pixel.png"], "step_title": "Step 2: LED and Heat Sink Selection"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "\n          Once you have laid out all the parts on you heat sink in CAD it's time to drill some holes.\u00a0 First mount the heat sink CPU face up on your mill table. My heat sink had 2 edges that protruded out from the body of the heat sink. I used a pair of 1-2-3 blocks and table clamps to hold the heat sink in place. Tighten the clamps to just snug for now.\u00a0 Next set up a dial indicator on one edge of the heat sink as shown. The exact reading is not important what your looking for is the reading not to move as you run the axis of the mill perpendicular to the dial gauge in and out. Gently tap on the corners of the heat sink to adjust it. Once the needle does not move more than a thousandths or so tighten down both clamps. Verify the heat sink did not move during clamp tightening by running the axis in and out while watching the dial indicator. If all is good (no or very little gauge movement) then the heat sink is parallel to your table.\u00a0 Next load up your edge finder and zero out to one edge of the heat sink in both directions. Load up a center drill and using the DRO and CAD drawing locate and pilot drill all the hole locations in the heat sink. Load up the #36 drill bit and drill out all the hold locations in the heat sink.\u00a0 Remove the heat sink from the mill and tap all holes to 6-32. Note if this is your first time tapping here are some tips:    Use plenty of cutting fluid on the tap and hole.\u00a0     Make sure when starting the tap you keep it parallel to the bore of the hole.\u00a0     When tapping only turn in 1/4 turn at a time then back out 1/2 turn and back in 1/2 turn.

Option 1 gives you maximum cooling all the time. Where options 2 gives less cooling and noise. In my testing a minimal amount of air flow was required to keep the heat sink cool to the touch. The fan PWM rates can be adjusted in firmware see the LED driver / dimmer instructable for more information.\u00a0 Some fans have a PWM input and can be driven directly by the PWM / on-off output of the driver card. The fan I had did not. It only had a RPM output wire. In the case of a fan RPM output wire it is not used and should be capped of. Since I did not have a PWM input on my fan I had to drive the PWM signal into the power feed. The following instructions assume your using this method to control the fan speed and your adding a power jack.   Connect the negative side of the power jack to the source pin of the IRF640\u00a0and pin 4 of J1 on the driver card. Cover any exposed connections (IRF640 and power jack) with heat shrink tubing.\u00a0     Connect the positive side of the power jack to the positive wire of the fan and pin 3 of J1 on the driver card.\u00a0Cover any exposed connections (power jack) with heat shrink tubing.     Connect the negative wire of the fan to the drain of the IRF640.Cover any exposed connections (IRF640) with heat shrink tubing.     Connect the gate of the IRF640 to pin 4 of J1 on the driver card.\u00a0Cover any exposed connections (IRF640) with heat shrink tubing.  Since the fan draws so little power there is no need to heat sink the IRF640. But you MUST isolate the tab on the IRF640 from the heat sink. If these short together the fan will receive full power all the time. Easiest way to do this is just put a piece of heat shrink tubing around the entire IRF640 (see photos) The power jack can be mounted in any \u00a0convenient way. The jack I removed from the old laptop had a small mounting screw on one side. Using that and some super glue I attacked it to one of the heat sink fins.\u00a0", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F9G/VGBU/HO235U48/F9GVGBUHO235U48.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF3/P2FF/HO235U49/FF3P2FFHO235U49.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR7/98ZK/HO235U4A/FR798ZKHO235U4A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAR/ZG2P/HO235U4B/FARZG2PHO235U4B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR7/7EZ3/HO235ZIH/FR77EZ3HO235ZIH.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Optional Fan and Power Jack Wiring."}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "\n          The lamp can be mounted in any wan that is convenient for your setup. A few guide lines when deciding mounting:    Make sure you have plenty of clearance around the intake and exhaust of the heat sink fins.\u00a0     Fiber optic cables do not like sharp bends they will break.\u00a0     If using a heat sink with \"heat pipes\" they work best when the CPU mounting flange is pointing down.\u00a0     If not using a fan orient the fins of the heat sink so the exhaust points up. This will use heat convection to draw air through the heat sink.\u00a0\u00a0  Other than that find a method that works best for your application. Could be a box that sits on your bench or in my case a bracket that hold the lamp on the post of my scope stand.\u00a0 To make the mounting bracket I started with a piece of HVAC galvanized sheet metal. The piece I had already had a small lip bent at a 90 degree angle. Note you will need to adjust the dimensions to match your heat sink and scope post (mine was slightly under 1.5\" in diameter) \u00a0 First I cut two 2.5\" square pieces from the HVAC sheet metal so each piece had a lip on one edge. Next I drilled 3 pilot holes using my drill press (MAKE SURE you clamp the metal down when drilling. DO NOT try and hold it with your hand unless you want to lose a finger.) Two of the holes are located on either end of the small lip for mounting the bracket to the heat sink. The third hole is located half way back from the lip and offset to one side such as it lines up with the center line of the heat sink. Note you will need to locate this hole on opposite end of the brackets to make a left and right side when mounted to the heat sink. If drilled in the same location they will not line up when installed on the heat sink. \u00a0Drill out all 3 holes with a #26 drill bit.\u00a0 Originally I was going to use a hole saw to cut the 1.5\" hole until I realized my hole saw was for wood only. I lucked out and happened to have a 1.5\" panel punch. So I drilled out the post mounting holes large enough for the panel punch bolt to slide though then punched out the hole to 1.5\". Either method would have worked equally well. Deburr the edges and holes.\u00a0 Next line up the brackets with the small lips pointing inward on the heat sink. Using a pen or punch transfer the 4 mounting hole locations to the heat sink. My heat sink happened to have a think backing plate on the top of the heat sink. Other than watching out for the heat pipes I was able to drill and tap this for mounting the bracket. Center punch the 4 mounting locations (if not done already) and using a center drill in a drill press pilot drill all 4 locations. Next drill out the holes using a #36 drill bit. Tap to 6-32 (all the same tapping rules apply as before.) and secure the mounting brackets as shown with short 6-32 screws and lock washers.\u00a0 At this point the light source is ready for use. assemble the source to the stand and attach the fiber bundle. Note do not over tighten the fiber bundle retaining screw and use zip ties to secure the fiber whip so that sharp bends are prevented.\u00a0\n        ", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F0R/AQ96/HO235U4M/F0RAQ96HO235U4M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAU/AWZN/HO235U4O/FAUAWZNHO235U4O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHN/9Y9X/HO235U4C/FHN9Y9XHO235U4C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0T/JD10/HO235U4D/F0TJD10HO235U4D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDK/8KST/HO235U4E/FDK8KSTHO235U4E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8P/F9UW/HO235U4F/F8PF9UWHO235U4F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2T/0JIB/HO235U4G/F2T0JIBHO235U4G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTB/4UHM/HO235U4H/FTB4UHMHO235U4H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKE/9ZVV/HO235U4I/FKE9ZVVHO235U4I.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Lamp Mounting"}], "channel": "Lighting"}, {"category": "workshop", "description": "Hi all..im farhan frm singapore and im 14 this year\rthis is my first instructuble and i want it to be great\rHere is the MiNi Airconditioner ideal for desktop usage\rand only with a burger box smalleness!!

The other blower is supplying air from outside to the house.  The ingoing air is warmed as it passes near the outgoing air inside the heat exchanger,  The blowers have 48 volt dc high efficiency motors and the power supply is a stepping power supply.  The speed of each blower is controlled via pulse wave modulation (PWM) provided by an arduino or attiny chip on a circuit.  Both extract and supply air ducts are filtered using automobile cabin filters.One thing to remember about this project is that making the ventilator unit is only half the battle.

I got these at a metal fabricator shop and they guillotined the two large sheets into 32 2ft x 1ft sheets.  I used 30 of these sheets to make my heat exchanger which measures 12\"x24\"x8\" approx.  The size of the heat exchanger will dictate the size of the box.  Don't make it too big for the access hatch to the attic.The aluminium sheets are laid one on top of the other with a pattern of mastic glue, that alternates at every other layer.  Before starting, look carefully at the pictures and you should be able to see that there are alternating gaps between every second sheet, at the corners  For example, layers 2 and 3 are gaps at that corner.  The diagram above shows the pattern of mastic (shown in blue) for each plate; the odd layers are shown in one image and the even layers are shown in the other.  Notice also the air flow direction.  The airflow goes in the opposite direction at each layer.  The sheets are quite heavy so I used small beads, (shown as red dots in diagram) embedded in the mastic to prevent the sandwich squashing while the mastic set.I also created a jig consisting of a flat piece of mdf with 4 blocks of 4\"x2\" sticking out of it vertically to help keep the plates aligned.

This type of blower can supply a lot of air under pressure and is energy efficient and importantly, doesn't require an external enclosure.  The shape of the compartment that the fan is in doesn't make too much difference but the blower inlet (internal diameter 125mm approx ) should closely match the diameter of the inlet spigot (provided by the red 5\" duct).  Approx 2mm clearance max around for best performance/low noise,These fans have 4 wires each.  Black for ground: red for 48volt: Yellow for PWM input: Blue for hall sensor output.  To control the speed you supply full 48v supply and gnd, and supply a pwm low voltage 0 - 5v-ish from your controller to the yellow depending on the speed you want.  Your controller should share a common ground.  You can also connect up the sensor to control the blower more accurately, or just to monitor its speed.  Because the motor itself has the electronics to deal with the PWM signal, your controller can be a low power milli amp device like an atmel attiny.  ie no power transistors required and no heat sinks etc.I mounted the blower with 5mm bolts onto a small section of ply.  Make sure the bolts are the correct lenght.  I then mounted the ply/blower on aluminium angle brackets using 6mm bolts with nylocks and screwed to the divider and box (through the insulation) with 70mm wood screws.  I cut 6 mm x 10mm slots in the aluminium bracket to allow for adjustment which helped when centering the blowers over the spigots.

A drain must be added to the bottom of compartment 4 because condensation will be produced in this compartment.  I drilled a 16mm hole an added a copper pipe hot gluing around it to seal.  I added a swan neck to this copper and added a garden hose and allowed this to slope downwards and exit the building (throught the gable of the attic)  If you don't add this drain, the box will fill with condensation as the outside temperature gets colder.Add an insulated back and attach to the box.

The blowers that I used were very both high speed blowers but I ended up with two different models.  Both needed a small fraction of full speed 75/254 and 35/254 as shown in the sketch.I arrived at these numbers based on the spec sheets of the fans and also by putting my hand up to the vents in the ceilings.   Typically I think these will output 400cfm at full speed, and I calculated that the house could do with 100cfm.

Place the adapter in a vice and drill out the hole3.       You will probably find that the thread on the adapter is stopping it from going into the top of the lighter.  To fix this you have to grind off the thread with a grinder.  4.       Keep on trying to push it into the lighter and grind if necessary until it fits5.       Now put the neck section into the top of the lighter and make sure that bush is also inside the neck.  6.       Add some flux and solder everything into place7.

You will also need to add an O ring to the bottom of the plug.  I only had to add one O ring in the end but you may have to add two depending on how big the gap is between the plug and the bottom of the lighter.4.  The last thing to do is to put the 1/2\" cap onto the top of the lighter.  If it is loose, slightly bend out the sides of the 1/2\" tube and add the cap again.

The voltage of most modern motorcycle batteries is 12 volts. \u00a0So 12V/ 3 ohms = 4 amps.\u00a0 Now we know how much current our pants will draw.\u00a0 So you want to know how hot this will be? Here's an excerpt from this sitePower [Watts] = Current          [Amps] x Voltage [Volts]Based on our project          consisting of a 12-volt battery and a current of 4-amps, the power          consumption would be (4-amps x 12-volts = ) 48-watts.\u00a0 The heat output of          48-watts, can be expressed in British Thermal Units (BTU) per hour by          performing the following conversion:BTU / Hour = Watts x          3.413Put simply, one British          Thermal Unit (BTU) is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature          of         1-pound ( lb) of water 1-degree Fahrenheit.\u00a0 Thus the vest in our project          would output ( 48-watts x 3.413 = ) approximately 164 BTUs per hour.\u00a0 If          this value isn't intuitive to you, consider that 48-watts is similar to a          50-watt light bulb, and imagine the amount of heat that a 50-watt light          bulb outputs.\u00a0 That may not sound like much, but when that amount of          heat is contained under a jacket, you will find that it is plenty warm.Also, if you were to look at the power output of Gerbing's heated pants, you'll see that they put out 44 watts of energy, so our pants will be warmer than theirs.\u00a0 If you want to go even hotter than that, just use a shorter length of wire.\u00a0 Just remember ohm's law and you'll be all set.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 2: Theory"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "After measuring out 30 feet of teflon wire, you'll want to thread it through the pants.\u00a0 Plan your layout.\u00a0 Otherwise you'll have a hard time figuring out where to put 30ft of wire.\u00a0 You'll want to put most\u00a0 of the wire where the wind will hit you.\u00a0 So for me, I put a bunch on my shins, and on my thighs.\u00a0 \u00a0 Turn the pants inside out.\u00a0 If you are using thermals, it helps if you wear them to stretch them out, otherwise you'll have a hard time putting the pants back on. Measure out 15 ft (or the halfway point) and mark it.\u00a0 Now starting at the middle point of the crotch, feed the wire all the way up to your halfway mark.\u00a0 Now tie a loose nut or put some tape to keep the other half from passing through.\u00a0 Make your way down the inseam, and then follow the pattern that I drew below.\u00a0 You'll want to finish around the waistband area.\u00a0 This is where we'll attach a connector.\u00a0 Once you finished with the one pant leg.\u00a0 Repeat the process for the other pant leg with the other half of the wire.\u00a0 This new layout is better as well because it doesn't constrict the legs like the spiral pattern does.\u00a0 It makes it much easier to put the pants on.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F4E/K3M3/G1BB7XA5/F4EK3M3G1BB7XA5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5F/ABX9/G1BBHM1R/F5FABX9G1BBHM1R.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRL/N79W/G1BBHM35/FRLN79WG1BBHM35.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F65/VZFJ/G1BBDGW8/F65VZFJG1BBDGW8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNQ/PAH4/G1BB7XCK/FNQPAH4G1BB7XCK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM0/LCNL/G145UFEV/FM0LCNLG145UFEV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZP/KEXG/G145T3OO/FZPKEXGG145T3OO.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Threading the Wire"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "After you have finished passing all of that wire through your pants, you'll want to connect them to the thicker gauge wire.\u00a0 After I soldered them, I\u00a0bent the thin wire down leaving some slack and taped it the the thicker wire.\u00a0 I did this to act as a sort of strain relief.\u00a0 If there is a better way to do this, please let me know.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ4/OEZD/G145UFER/FZ4OEZDG145UFER.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FT2/MN8P/G145NUZY/FT2MN8PG145NUZY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPR/GF89/G145T3PT/FPRGF89G145T3PT.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Soldering the Wires"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Now it's time to add a connector to the end.\u00a0 Tie a knot in the thicker gauge wire and then pass them through the pants;

Now the M5 screws can easily thread in the fan, and no nuts are needed. You could also try using the screws themselves to make the threads. Otherwise, use M4 screws and nuts.Now, we'll solder the boost converter to the fan. Make sure the USB/power wire is fed through the case and solder the red and black USB wires to the 'IN' markings. Attach a multimeter to the 'OUT' pins, and turn the potentiometer (on the boost converter) until you get 12V. When you're sure the boost converter outputs 12V, solder the red and black fan wires from the fan to the 'OUT' markings. I glued the USB wire in place, because the wires were very fragile.

It is pretty expensive, but it is powerful giving a very bright light. It provides also an excellent colour blending.It could be replaced by cheaper and probably equivalent ones; when I designed this, it was the only one suitable I could find.Due to the LED's high power rating it is absolutely necessary to provide it with a reasonable heat sink like the one you see in the photos; before putting the finished circuit in a case check the LEDs for heat at maximum intensity on all of the three colours. The current limiting resistors I chose match my LED only !I chose a 10% less than the typical recommended V-I values on the datasheet curves.Being the circuit in a plastic case it is not safe to pull dissipation any higher while a metallic case with an external dissipation scheme might make safe to pull the LEDs currents a make a more powerful beam.Different LEDs do have different ratings. Check the datasheets for maximum dissipation and recommendations for your LED.I purchased my LED online from Distrelec. Farnellinone carries them also.The drivers are surplus NPN transistors over-dimensioned for the current required. Less powerful TO126 encased NPNs should do fine. As the Transistor are driven with PWM, their dissipation is kept to a minimum so heat sink is not necessary.The IR receiver is one i savaged from a dead TV toghether with the remote control. The receiver has a metallic screen that should be grounded to 0V. Some newer small-sized ones are from Temic and can be bought from the same sources as above. Practically any receiver works fine, provided that it has 5Volt logic levels (and supply) and has the same (or close) carier frequency as the remote transmitter (typically 38-50kHz). When demolishing a TV or any other remote controlled piece of equipmentm, a good rule is to save both the remote and the receiver. By the way, I love saving transformers, VFD, motors as well, but that's another story.This lamp uses an european RC5 standard for Philips TV remotes; Any programmable remote control that supports Philips TVs should be fine, I tried one and it works.Both remote decoding and PWM generating routines should be understandable from the source code I commented.The circuit must be supplied from a 5 Volt, 1A good source. Initially I used a linear voltage regulator IC on the board into the case, but the heat generated by the regulator was way too much to be easily dissipated from within the box, so I removed it and now I'm using anexternal waal adapter with a regulated 5V 3A output. The LEDs are powered directly from the 5Volt, so any variation would trash your precise calculations for currents to flow through the LEDs, possibly damaging them. So, the better and stable the supply, the better.The case I chose is a Teko TB9, it looks elegant to me and small transparent objects can be placed on top of the case+LED without the risk of falling.

The device emits a light whose intensity varies several times per minute. When the intensity of light increases, breathe in, when the intensity decreases, breathe out. During the full cycle, the frequency slowly decreases from 11 to 6 breaths per minute.UPDATE 1 (27 january 2018) : I added new photos, changed the color of the LEDs as suggested in the comments, add a new LED (blue) inside the box, use thinner wires, sanded the box, redone the bottom plate so that it is slightly larger than its housing so that it stays in place by adjustment, and add Fritzing file.

Lastly, I cut out a hole in the plastic above the actual fan, but I made the diameter less than the fan. This is because there is a large area in the center without any blades.

The line will represent the direction the straws will face. To make a faster and thinner tornado, angle the straw more towards the center (but not too much). You can see how much I angled the straws in (picture 1).Next, fit the straw through the hole in the plexiglass by .5 cm or 1/4 inch.

If the wood piece is not big enough to cover the entire height, just use another and glue them close together. (Picture 1 and 2)Before I started plating the tub though, I had to add the humidifier/ ultrasonic module. Simply hot glue it to at the bottom of the tub so that the spray of water won't hit any of the holes on the plexiglass. The ultrasonic module works by emitting high frequency waves. The waves then vibrate the water and turns it into a mist.Important: make sure that when you fill up the lower tub with water, you fill to around 3 cm above the surface of the module. This is the range at which it works best and creates the most fog.Next, I made a small frame out of wood sticks and glued it to the tub as I went. (Picture 3). I then glued wood panels onto the frame to create a box for the base. Make sure you create a small hole for wires before gluing on the final panel. (Pictures 4 and 5)I'm not going to discuss in detail how to make the frame since it depends on the box size and preference. If the plastic tub is a shape you like, you can just spray paint it black. I spray painted the top on my fan housing a flat black color.

It can monitor the temperature and displays it on an LCD display in the range of \u201350\u00b0C to +150\u00b0C. The heart of the circuit is an Arduino board which controls all its functions. A NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) Thermistor is used as temperature sensor. There are many potential applications for NTC thermistors. Their accuracy and stability make them highly useful for a wide range of purposes.  These applications include temperature measurement, compensation, and control. Over the last decade, advances in electronics have made devices smaller, cheaper and faster. This project is about how the speed of a fan can be controlled, based on temperature sensor. It is also a part of smart home application where the fan will gradually increase its speed if the temperature is increasing. In general, home appliance fans need to be operated manually with the help of regulators with the variation of temperature, thus requires a repeatedly extra effort for regulating the fan speed which acts to our agony. So as to reduce this extra effort and to add comfort, it is intended in this paper designing an \u201cAutomatic Temperature Controlled Fan\u201d.The main intension is to control the fan by heating the sensor, i.e. the thermistor, where the speed of the fan is dependent and controlled by any device\u2019s temperature like PC. As the temperature of the device increases or decreases, the speed of fan increases or decreases respectively. So, it can be used mainly as a cooling device. By modifying the circuit slightly, it can also be used to control the room temperature, depending on the property of thermistor. The thermistor used in the circuit here, decreases its resistance with increasing temperature, hence the electrical conductivity also increases, increasing voltage across it, resulting in an increment in the speed of the fan. Thus, it is possible to control the speed of the fan automatically when the device\u2019s temperature varies. Experiment can be followed to evaluate whether this circuit can save energy through the use of temperature sensor and thus promote efficiency.The circuit exploits the property of sensor to operate the DC Fan. A sensor is a type of transducer. In a broader sense, a transducer is sometimes defined as any device that converts energy from one form to another. Besides that, the component that made up the temperature sensor is known as thermistor. Thermistor is a kind of temperature dependent resistor and its resistance varies depending on the temperature in its vicinity. There are two types of Thermistors- Negative Temperature Coefficient Thermistor (NTC) and Positive Temperature Coefficient Thermistor (PTC). Thermistors are an analog temperature device is interfaced to the analog pin of the Arduino board, through its built-in ADC, which converts these analog reading and displays that on the LCD, to indicate temperature of the device. User-defined temperature settings can be done using push buttons provided through Arduino board. Maximum and minimum settings are used for allowing any necessary hysteresis. Few push buttons are used to set the temperature by INC, for increase and DEC for decrease settings. As soon the max and min temperatures are set then the Arduino program generates PWM output on the corresponding digital output according to the measured temperature. This is fed to a DC Fan through a motor driver IC. The fan speed is proportional to the temperature measured.", "title": "Automatic Temperature Control Fan Speed ", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Automatic-Temperature-Monitoring-and-Control-Syste/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": ".List of Material :four  10 K\u03a9.One 1 K\u03a9One 220 \u03a9OneRed LEDOne Fan Based DC Motor ( DC,12V, 2400 RPM, 0.13A)One NTC Thermistor 103 ( Resistance (at 25\u2103) 10K \u2126  Operating Range-50 \u2103 ~ 150 \u2103 Thermal Time Constant 20 s Thermal Dissipation Constant 6.5mW/\u2103 Max. allowable power 550 mW )One LCD Display ( 20 characters per line by 2 lines) Four Push Button Switches.One Variable Resister 10 k\u03a9One BreadboardMany wires One Arduino uno One L293D Motor DriverTwo Lithium BatteriesOne cell box", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FH5/GENJ/JACTNOVW/FH5GENJJACTNOVW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Material Needed for This Project "}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": ".The resistance of most common types of thermistor decreases as the temperature rises.

A model for the resistivity of a semiconductor as a function of the temperature was found by Steinhart and Hart 1968. a common method to characterize a thermistor is to use the Steinhart-Hart equation: 1/T = A + [B * ln(R)] + [C * ln(R)^3]The Steinhart-Hart law describes the absolute temperature T (in Kelvins) as a function of the NTC thermistor's resistivity (in \u03a9) according to the formula above.Where:T = Degrees Kelvin R = Resistance A, B, C = Curve-fitting constants.In my testing for the sensor, I notice the next result varying the temperature:T = 0\u00b0C when the resistance of a 10kohm thermistor R is 33430 ohmsT = 50\u00b0C when the resistance of a 10kohm thermistor R is 3510 ohmsT = 100\u00b0C when the resistance of a 10kohm thermistor R is 637ohmsThe coefficients A, B and C are found by taking the resistance of the thermistor at threetemperatures and solving three simultaneous equations.A = 0.001176064644B = 0.0002293915326C = 0.000000084309207652.

What a magical, amazing thing!  Needless to say, it stuck in my mind like wild fire :) So here I am now adapting and making something that will hopefully bring some magic and mystery to people's minds.I did a lot of research into how silk flames are made. Basically they are a piece of silk or fabric mounted above a fan with light projecting onto the material.As the material moves between the two different colour sources it creates a flicker effect because of the bend in the fabric. Cool huh. I found out that a silk called Habotai silk is the silk of choice to use and super bright LEDs and a good fan help. Most of what I learnt did not apply to a fan the size that I chose to use.I ran into problems with my design being miniaturised and found the best option for me was tiny computer fans matched with marabou feathers.

There are half a dozen ways that small pieces of timber can be mounted on a lathe. My first idea was to glue and screw my blocks of timber to a piece of ply so I could get to the inside and shape the cup part of my design. This plan was short-lived when I discovered my block had not been completely squared at the base, making it spin unevenly in the lathe. Since it was a small piece I decided to keep going to practice and give everyone the idea. If you decide to go this way, cut some square ply at least 20mm thick and mark diagonals on this.

I borrowed my dads soldering iron and bought a third hand with magnifying glass which was a worthwhile investment.I bought some water clear LEDs on ebay and some small computer fans with high RPM. The LEDs are super bright and the fans are super fast. LEDs will set you back about 8 dollars and the fans 20 dollars each. You will also need some wire strippers, heat shrink and solder.One of the first things I would like to talk about is resistors. Resistors slow the accessible current that a component draws. Their reading is in ohms. Resistors are important in maintaining your LED life. If the current is too high, your leds will blow and not work, too low and they will dim. Resistors also improve the battery life because your battery can only realease what the resistor allows. To work out what resistor you need you will need to know what's in your circuit. What volts each component is running and what amps or milliamps each is drawing.Here is a small example of how I worked out my resistor for my LEDS. I have included a formula for you to work your future electronics out on also.Red LED . 2.2volts, 20mil ampOrange LED. 2volts, 20mil ampFormula.    VOLTS OF POWER SUPPLY - VOLTS OF LEDS / AMPS OF LEDSSolution 6V-4.2=1.8               1.8/0.40=45ohmAfter you work out this the rest is pretty much soldering your components together. Start by attaching the resistor to your LED. Make sure your LED is the right way around being that the longer leg of the LED is the positive and the shorter is the negative. Next attach the next LED in line either by joining the legs or attaching a wire in between. I must note here that I bought a large 6 volt battery to test my circuit and it ran the fan and leds no problems (See picture with red and black alligator clips) but a small battery will not do the same. I solved this by simply using a Dremel and sanding drum to clear more room in the timber cup to allow for another battery.  :)Following on after your resistor and two LEDs are attached, extend the positive and negative and use some heat shrink to neaten it all up and prevent wires from crossing. Bend the LEDS so they sit around the base of the fan.For the fans, strip the wire ends with wire strippers and tin them with solder. Ready for your battery.When you're done you will have two circuits in each earring. A fan with battery and two LEDS with a 45ohm resistor in front of them.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTK/RHM0/I3H76AVB/FTKRHM0I3H76AVB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F83/YC8F/I3H76AVE/F83YC8FI3H76AVE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQJ/DJJB/I3H76AVK/FQJDJJBI3H76AVK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1O/B9PE/I3H76AVM/F1OB9PEI3H76AVM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCC/I1A9/I3H76AVO/FCCI1A9I3H76AVO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTL/GI3S/I3H76AUZ/FTLGI3SI3H76AUZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSZ/TP8R/I3H76AVR/FSZTP8RI3H76AVR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZK/XB51/I3H76AVX/FZKXB51I3H76AVX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN5/7FRG/I3H76QUG/FN57FRGI3H76QUG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH0/TBDI/I3H76QUR/FH0TBDII3H76QUR.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Electronics!!"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "This is a little trick that was born out of my frustration in trying to find a good compact way of connecting the little batteries to a power source when space is an issue.

JThey have been implemented in more scenarios than almost any other router on the market due to cost, ease of use, and potential abilities.\u00a0With the GL being Newegg.com \u2018s number one selling wireless router as well as on the sites Top Ten sold of ALL products (as of today 5/10/2010)\u00a0and the GS reported in New York Times Online Top 10 Most Popular Routers worldwide(as of today 5/10/2010) , you cannot go wrong with this little wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing.The $50 WRT54G with DD-WRT firmware in a parabolic dish setup helped to set the 2nd place world record for unamplified Wi-Fi distance in Venezuela @ 173miles!!!! Second only to the $100 XR5 on a $190 PCEngine WRAP board at 189miles in Italy. Recap here Long Range Wi-Fi WikiMost versions of this router have the ability to upgrade its firmware to an open-source Linux build called DD-WRT downloadable from DD-WRT (free). If you decide to upgrade to a firmware on this site, PLEASE read ALL the directions, FAQ, Wiki and Forum EXTREMELY THUROUGHLY, as improper firmware flashing can leave you with a very expensive paperweight. I cannot stress this enough! You have been warned!With a (somewhat) simple upgrade to the appropriate firmware, this $40 - $60 router can save you hundreds of dollars and open up a seemingly endless amount of capabilities (and void the warranty). Chances are though, if you\u2019re confident in performing these upgrades, you couldn\u2019t give a darn about warranties. You\u2019ve already voided more of them than you care to keep track of. AmIright?The purpose of upgrading this router is so that we can safely use the \"DD-WRT\" firmware \"Overclocking\" and \"Increased Transmit\" functions to their max without having to worry about overheating issues! Note: I\u2019ve heard several people arguing that adding heatsinks is not necessary; that they have maxed theirs out without any problems. I have personally burned out 2 of these units, and had serious stability issues in others due to overheating by maxing out without extra heatsinks at the very least.

You\u2019ll be applying a SMALL about of flux on them later, but the longer it sets there, better chance it has to corrode your parts and can lead to dendrite growth. You\u2019d be amazed at how fast stranded copper wire can corrode away with a tiny bit of flux left on it\u2026 We\u2019ll take our stranded wire, straighten it out, and strip both ends of it leaving about 1 - 1.5 cm exposed.Now we\u2019re going to take our paintbrushes, and dip JUST THE VERY TIP into the flux.Twist the ends of the wire so the copper strands form a sort of spiral. I forgot to do this in this picture, but I corrected it later, and forgot to take a picture. Generations of selective OCD is funny like that sometimes. Gently apply the flux to JUST THE VERY TIP of the wire tips ON ONE END. If flux makes its way down past the wire shielding, you aren\u2019t gonna be getting it out, and you might as well get a new wire.Press the side of the soldering iron tip to the speaker wire, and feed the solder wire through the other side. By doing this it heats more than just the point of solder contact which helps the solder flow freely through the center of the wire strands.Should look something like this when you\u2019re done, except twisty. ( Because you aren\u2019t going to forget that part :P )Apply a minimal amount of flux to the two pins on the power jack.Press your wire to the Jack, and press the side of the soldering iron tip to the top of the speaker wire until the bond, then remove the iron.Do this to both wires.Before we do anything else, we want to thoroughly clean the remaining flux from the board. For that we need to wash it several times with some isopropyl alcohol and a small (preferably lintless) swab. I haven\u2019t had any in a while, so I\u2019m extra careful not to leave any\u00a0particles on the board. Ive tried several methods for applying alcohol like eyedroppers, needle tipped squirt tips and spray bottles. For this purpose, the spray bottle is the way to go. If I were removing tiny components, obviously I\u2019d be using a needle tipped bottle, and a decent iron for that matter.Make sure the mainboard is THUROUGHLY cleaned!Apply some electrical tape under the wires to protect it from the thru-hole solder tips that can slowly dig into the wire over time due to the vibration of the added fan(s).Flip the mainboard over, and crease the wire along the side of the antenna plug. Since these edges are pretty sharp too, I also put electrical tape on them, buts it\u2019s more than likely not necessary.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FAS/UJ3J/G91Y4HCZ/FASUJ3JG91Y4HCZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF0/HLXV/G91Y4HD2/FF0HLXVG91Y4HD2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO8/699G/G91Y4HD6/FO8699GG91Y4HD6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUR/WSIP/G91Y4HDJ/FURWSIPG91Y4HDJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM2/ZES7/G91Y4HDP/FM2ZES7G91Y4HDP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7G/YME9/G91Y4HDX/F7GYME9G91Y4HDX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXZ/WIHV/G91Y4HE7/FXZWIHVG91Y4HE7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG0/KH78/G91Y4HEH/FG0KH78G91Y4HEH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOX/5JWT/G91Y4HEW/FOX5JWTG91Y4HEW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9X/T20T/G91Y4HF7/F9XT20TG91Y4HF7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUC/8BK1/G91Y4HFK/FUC8BK1G91Y4HFK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGJ/5ZPS/G91Y4HFX/FGJ5ZPSG91Y4HFX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQR/ZHWH/G91Y4HGB/FQRZHWHG91Y4HGB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGP/TYIJ/G91Y4HGS/FGPTYIJG91Y4HGS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FME/YE1R/G91Y4HH8/FMEYE1RG91Y4HH8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYD/PRNL/G91Y4HHQ/FYDPRNLG91Y4HHQ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Add Power Cable"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "In this step, we will be adding the optional but recommended heatsink/ fan on the CPU. The best fan for this project in my opinion is a small but powerful heatsink mounted fan that you can get off a bunch of old NVIDIA cards. I was lucky that a local computer shop had a box of the NVIDIA RIVA TNT 2 cards going for $2 a pop! I bought 15 in total and the guy gave me a discount @ $20 total for the lot. I plan on modding many more of these routers in the future if anyone would like to buy a finished one, just let me know JFlip the card over, and pinch the pins to release them.Pull the heatsink off the chip; unplug it, and CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN!That abomination of a goop needs to be thoroughly cleaned off so the tiny particle silvers in the superior Arctic Silver Ceramic Adhesive can fit into the microscopic grooves on the underside of the heatsink. \nClean with a lint-free cloth and rubbing alcohol over and over until no more residue rubs\u00a0off and discolors the cloth. \nThen clean it again. \nMaybe once more. \nThat\u2019s good. \nOk, stop.Now we\u2019re going to remove the pins and the fan. Save the screws cus were just gonna use em again.This is a perfect opportunity to clean the topside of the heatsink. Take your old toothbrush, spray it with a bunch of alcohol and clean clean clean!Now let\u2019s break off the unnecessary metal brackets extending from the sides. \nGrab your vice grips, clamp them on to the bracket nice and tight, and bend it back and forth till it snaps off. Now take your wire clippers and trim the edges as much as you can.If this is satisfactory for you, then you can skip the next part. I however love watching the sparks fly off metal objects I\u2019m working on, so I rarely pass up the opportunity to grind out sharp edges whenever I can :PGrab your Dremel, attach your favorite spark-inducing grinding bit and enjoy the fireworks!Once the edges are baby bottom smooth, it\u2019s time to go ahead and work on that fan. \nNow by default, the fan blows air AT the heatsink. \nFor this mod, we want the fan to blow heat up and out of the unit and away from the CPU.It should be mentioned that it is a good idea to remove the sticker from this side, because heat, spin, and gravity will all be working against it when you flip the fan over. \nI have only had it happen once, but the sticker came off and got jammed between the fan and heatsink, blocking the rotation. The router was not damaged, but the fan had to be replaced.For added coolness, just flip the fan over and press it to the topside. \nA dab of superglue might work if the adhesive doesn\u2019t. For this fan in particular, you\u2019re going to need to drill larger openings on the other side of this fan for the screws to fit in. \nI recommend using a cone shaped routing bit, but others can be used so long as you\u2019re very cautious. \nThe cone shape helps keep you from drilling the holes TOO BIG all the way through, thus preventing you from accidentally making holes that the screws just falls through.Also another perfect opportunity to clean something. Grab that old toothbrush and clean clean clean those fan blades if they need it, chances are they probably do!Once you have drilled your holes large enough for the screws to drop in, but not all the way through, go ahead and mount it back to the heatsink.To remove the white plug on the cord without cutting it, just slide your paperclip under the lip, grab the corresponding wire and give it a little pull.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FGD/FDYW/G91Y4HK2/FGDFDYWG91Y4HK2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP2/3BW1/G91Y4HK5/FP23BW1G91Y4HK5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAD/D6WO/G91Y4HKA/FADD6WOG91Y4HKA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMU/ZO2P/G91Y4HKG/FMUZO2PG91Y4HKG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCO/MZOQ/G91Y4HKN/FCOMZOQG91Y4HKN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRJ/CQCY/G91Y4HKV/FRJCQCYG91Y4HKV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG8/DHSP/G91Y4HL3/FG8DHSPG91Y4HL3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSI/VNUY/G91Y4HLC/FSIVNUYG91Y4HLC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWR/OTJI/G91Y4HLO/FWROTJIG91Y4HLO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXX/IGBS/G91Y4HLZ/FXXIGBSG91Y4HLZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTH/HEEB/G91Y4HMB/FTHHEEBG91Y4HMB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPB/288K/G91Y4HMP/FPB288KG91Y4HMP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDY/D12Z/G91Y4HN4/FDYD12ZG91Y4HN4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3Q/1KRX/G91Y4HNJ/F3Q1KRXG91Y4HNJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0B/5P9N/G91Y4HO1/F0B5P9NG91Y4HO1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2X/MRGM/G91Y4HOI/F2XMRGMG91Y4HOI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXZ/IZTI/G91Y4HP0/FXZIZTIG91Y4HP0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH7/87XW/G91Y4HPJ/FH787XWG91Y4HPJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9U/C9KP/G91Y4HQ3/F9UC9KPG91Y4HQ3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFR/LUFP/G91Y4HQO/FFRLUFPG91Y4HQO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8L/O4M7/G91Y4HRA/F8LO4M7G91Y4HRA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXI/YW28/G91Y4HRX/FXIYW28G91Y4HRX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEK/Z839/G91Y4HSL/FEKZ839G91Y4HSL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ8/1MCT/G91Y4HTA/FQ81MCTG91Y4HTA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM2/AXOR/G91Y4HU0/FM2AXORG91Y4HU0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7Q/QJR7/G91Y4HUS/F7QQJR7G91Y4HUS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1N/P45N/G91Y4HVL/F1NP45NG91Y4HVL.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Aquire Heatsink"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "In this step we will be mixing and applying theThermal Adhesive to the CPU, and mounting the heatsink/fan.The ratio is equal 1A:1B.

My Favorite part is that it doesn't matter what computer or operating system you use to connect to the MCU running StickOS, because Terminal programs all use the same protocols so it can be reprogrammed on the fly using anything with a terminal and serial port.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ9/YY5C/H1EMI0QI/FQ9YY5CH1EMI0QI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAY/QKH9/H1ENC5JJ/FAYQKH9H1ENC5JJ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: StickOS: What Is That?"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Step 1: First start by disassembling your toaster, you will need to remove the dials and timers as we won't be using them. Make sure to keep the wire as it is rated for high heat and we will be using that later. Also make sure its not plugged in while you disassemble it...Step 2: Next line the inside of the toaster (the gap between the inner and outer shell) with fiberglass insulation, this will help keep the heat in and thus help maintain a steady temperature.Step 3: Mount the SSR. The toaster i used had a convention fan so i used a two channel relay so I could control the heating elements separate from the fan.Step 4: Drill a hole in the back/side of the toaster and mount the thermocouple. i made a brace out of steel strapping to hold the thermocouple in place. Ideally you want to mount the thermocouple as close to the level where your boards are located.Step 5: Solder the Max6675 to the smt to dip breakout board then solder that to the protoboard. One thing that i noticed which threw me off a bit was that the yellow wire of the thermocouple is +ve and the red wire is -ve...not sure what colour code they were following.Step 6: You're almost done! Wire the Thermocouple, LCD, Button Joystick to the Protoboard then connect that to the Adapt9S12DP512. I laser cut an acrylic faceplate and mounted all the pieces to that but you can mount them to a project box if you don't have access to lasers.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F3X/W18Z/H1HMDKTV/F3XW18ZH1HMDKTV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKM/9PNW/H1EMHZUG/FKM9PNWH1EMHZUG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOF/34L0/H1EMHZUE/FOF34L0H1EMHZUE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRJ/PKBF/H1HMDL5E/FRJPKBFH1HMDL5E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F16/SUKJ/H1EMHZTK/F16SUKJH1EMHZTK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMZ/4NXM/H1HMDKU3/FMZ4NXMH1HMDKU3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEZ/13W2/H1EN06ZC/FEZ13W2H1EN06ZC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKX/GQCL/H1EN70JV/FKXGQCLH1EN70JV.LARGE.jpg", "/assets/img/pixel.png"], "step_title": "Step 3: Where to Start"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "******************************** *****Technological Arts****** ******************************** \u00a0 Project: Reflow Toaster \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For:\u00a0 MC9S12DP512 | MAX6675 | K-Type Thermocouple | NHD-0420DZ-NSW-BBW > pins (Must be designated by typing \"pins <Statement>\") heartbeat pp7 safemode* pa6 for k type thermocouple yellow/green wire = +ve, red wire = -ve rem //LCD -

It was extremely useful - to be exact, there has not been a day that I used my table for something without turning it on, since I built it. However, my needs have changed a bit: Most of the time, I wan't to change the brightness of my lamps, and not the spectrum, which is something that isn't very easy with SpectrumLED (V1), so I came up with a simple solution: I built the Articulating 70W Spectrum-Balanced LED Panel, which has the perfect spectrum for my needs, and has a dimmer that controls only the total brightness. This was a HUGE success!However, I noticed that when taking pictures, making sure that all of the lights that shine on the object emit the same color temperature is really important. This is something that is fairly difficult to do with SpectrumLED (V1), considering the amount of times that I change brightness, without wanting to change the spectrum... I'm also not that satisfied with the articulating arm - it didn't turn out as well as I thought it would: it's either too loose and shakes, or too hard to change from position to position. This might not sound like a big issue, but since it isn't counter-weighted, I have to tighten the tilting bolt (the base) extremely tightly. The other arms also aren't that simple to adjust.As you can see, the combination of both of them wasn't as good as I thought it would be, so my first thought was to replace SpectrumLED (V1) with another articulating spectrum-balanced LED panel that I would build, which would give me what I wanted. However, I still wanted the option of changing the spectrum, and I didn't come this far only to come this far, so in this 21 step Instructable, I will show you how I made SpectrumLED V2.0 - The World's Most Over-Engineered, 80 Watt Variable Spectrum LED Lamp. I will also show you how to make an wooden articulating arm that contains 5 degrees of freedom, meaning that it both swivels and tilts in two different places, and telescopes. The arm is balanced by a unique counterweight, which provides an incredibly smooth tilting action (more on that later :).-(Watch the YouTube video: LINK FOR MOBILE VIEWERS!)-SpectrumLED's features:\u2022 Variable spectrum made easy with switches! \u2713 \u2022 Uses a Non-Flicker Dimmer (better for cameras, doesn't give headaches, simpler than CC) \u2713\u2022 Energy saving light output with 8X10W LED's (equivalent to ~500W incandescent lamp) \u2713 \u2022 Has a balanced articulating and telescoping wooden arm (5 degrees of freedom), and can be adjusted to different positions WAY faster! \u2713\u2022 Reaches almost every part of my room (for example, even under my table in this video) \u2713\u2022 Can be built with fairly basic tools \u2713 \u2022 Very low cost to make (*Ahem*, PERFECT FOR YOUR BUDGET!) at $6 \u2713\u2022 Looks AWESOME! \u2713I will be giving away free Instructables memberships to members that make their own SpectrumLED V2.0.

It took me over 2 weeks to come up with this design, since every time that I thought I finished it, I had another idea for improvement. While building, I made only a few changes, which I will explain later.Below are the three main mechanical differences (others were explained in other steps/the intro) between this one, and the mechanics of the articulating arm that I built for the 70W Spectrum-Balanced LED Panel:The Counterweight - I added a counterweight (transformer that was salvaged from a microwave) because I don't want to have to tighten the bolts down really tightly, which causes some problems. It also makes it easier to change from one position to a different one, reduces the stress on the mounts, and more. In addition, if a bolt failed because of contraction of the wood, or any other reason, the lamp would fall onto my table slowly, and would not wake me up in the middle of the night. Ask me how I know that...The Adjustable/Telescoping Stand -  I don't think I'll need a big articulating arm where I'm going to mount it: most of the time, I don't need to make the light reach a far place, so I fold them, and they get in a the way a bit. Also, 3 articulating segments aren't enough, and 4 are awkward to use. I can also turn it, so I don't need to make an additional swiveling mechanism for the top. The telescoping arm that I salvaged from a fan stand swivels, and also makes it easier to connect to the counterweight.Don't have an adjustable fan mount? An adjustable handle from a mop stick, a selfie stick, and an leg of an old tripod are all good alternatives.The Plywood Discs - I decided to use two thick plywood discs for the swiveling part, instead of two intersecting pieces of wood, which is what I used for the articulating spectrum-balanced LED panel. The discs eliminate 90% of the wobble (bigger surface area + thick and hard plywood), and most importantly, provide a fixed amount of friction. They will also self polish themselves over time, meaning that probably in a few weeks, they will feel almost like glass.

The DIY portable desktop laser engraving machine. The Engraver can engrave on wood and plastic, Cut through foam sheets and paper. The machine can be used to do tons of creative work, the only limit is Imagination (besides the work area).The work area of Mr-Engraver is 38mm x 38mm. The whole machine was built , while keeping Laser safety in mind. I have built a cabinet for the machine. This protects the user from direct viewing. And know what ... its equipped with the \"Automatic laser shutdown\" What is Automatic shutdown?Class 3B and higher power lasers can be harmful when viewed with naked eyes. So I thought to block the rays by building a cabinet. But what if someone accidentally opens the door while the system in working? Here's where the Auto Shutdown plays its role. When the door is opened, the limit switch cuts off the power of the laser immediately shutting off the laser.     For this instructable we will be building our own Laser Focusing Module from scratch...  You may ask \"Why not simply buy the already made module? One could buy an Aixiz housing off eBay.. But what challenge is that? Also Building is fun, you can learn a lot while making... and proudly say that you have made it!The crystal clear prints of the laser have impressed me. I am still engraving a lot and will share the results with you when I get a masterpiece!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------While making the Engraver machine, I had a lots of failures, earlier with the axes movement and later with the Laser extraction and focusing. Read the whole story in last step.... Innovation is messy...!  \"I have not failed ... I've just discovered 1000 new ways that wont work \" --- Thomas Edison Quick Review:1) 250mW Red Laser Diode2) Ventilation fan to drive out smoke3) Laser Safe design 4) Laser Auto shutdown Ready to get your hands dirty?

The cooling mod makes the use of the display and camera connectors more difficult but can stop the Pi throttling back when overclocked or undertaking processor intensive work.  Access to the GPIO connector isn't normally impeded but you do have to position the fan carefully...I've divided the Instructable into two parts to ease readability - Part 1 covers the power supply modification, Part 2 the addition of a cooling fan and heatsinks.  The possible novelty of part 2 is the use of a 12v dc fan powered from the 5v dc output of the voltage regulator. The use of a 12v fan in this way is to provide a modicum of cooling with reduced noise, a feature that's needed when the RasPi is used (as an OSMC media centre) in our living room as my partner can hear a pin drop from well, virtually any distance you care to mention....Please note that I've tried to pitch the detail to cover as wide a readership as I can but some basic electronics skills are necessary, such as soldering, using a multimeter etc.  I apologise therefore if the following reads too simply or assumes too much - any and all constructive comments are of course very welcome!", "title": "Raspberry Pi Power & Cooling Mods", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-Power-Cooling-Mods/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Parts:(A Raspberry Pi and case) - a transparent case makes these mods easier but an opaque case is not a show-stopper.

Multimeter capable of measuring resistance and dc voltage.  Heat gun (for heat shrink)  Hot glue gun (not needed if using a sacrificial USB lead)  Fine marker pen  1.5mm and 2.5mm HSS drill bits and drill.  Wire cutter and stripper.*Notes regarding the choice of power supply:The important parameters are the output voltage and power.  You need to provide the LM2596 regulator with approximately three volts more on its input than you need on the output, so for the 5v output needed by the Pi, you need around 8v on the input.  I'd recommend a little more to be sure, hence the 9v minimum above.  The maximum voltage you can use is around 35v for some models of this regulator, higher for others.  I'd stick to 30v max.The power supply also needs to be able to provide enough current to the Pi (see here for the current requirements for different models of Pi).  The link says that you need a power supply capable of delivering a minimum of 2.5A for a Pi 3.  However, the LM2596 is a switching regulator, so you need less current than this as long as the voltage you provide is proportionately higher.  To work out what you need, calculate the power drawn by the Pi and take into account the conversion losses in the regulator (eg) a Pi 3 needs 5v @ 2.5A, so its power requirement is 5 x 2.5 = 12.5W.  Multiply this by 1.1 to take account of the losses in the regulator and you get 12.5 x 1.1 = 13.75W.  Having arrived at that figure, it's never a good idea to stress a power supply by using it at 100% capability, so I'd add at least a 30% margin to ensure it's not going to get too hot and expire prematurely.  To make things easier for everyone, here's the minimum power supply current requirements for different voltages based upon the calculations above:Pi 3:  9v / 2A; 12v / 1.5A; 15v / 1.2A; 19v / 0.9A; 26v / 0.7A; 30v / 0.6APi B+ & 2B: 9v / 1.5A; 12v / 1.1A; 15v / 0.9A; 19v / 0.7A; 26v / 0.5A; 30v / 0.4APi Zero & Zero W: 9v / 1.0A; 12v / 0.7A; 15v / 0.6A; 19v / 0.5A; 26v / 0.3A; 30v / 0.3A(The latter is included for completeness)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FC6/0SKI/JDYUQE9U/FC60SKIJDYUQE9U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA2/GWY6/JDYUQECD/FA2GWY6JDYUQECD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV6/OO4R/JDYUQE4J/FV6OO4RJDYUQE4J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMM/F3W5/JDYUQE8A/FMMF3W5JDYUQE8A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNK/4CQY/JDYUUZST/FNK4CQYJDYUUZST.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Part 1 Power Supply Mods: Tools & Parts"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Position the regulator as shown.

The steps below are my personal take.As far as I can gather, the advice via the Raspberry Pi Foundation is you don't really need to add heatsinks to any model of Pi unless you're overclocking them.  However, I've found that Pi 3 gets rather hot when attempting to play H265 videos and if not cooled can throttle back in an act of self-preservation.  Under these circumstances, the Broadcom SoC (the big chip on the upper surface of the Pi) gets the hottest, so that's worth heatsinking.  Following some advice which I can't find the source of at the moment, I also heatsink the RAM chip on the underside.  I don't bother with the smaller LAN chip as it doesn't seem to get that hot.So, to business - peel off the cover strip from the heatsink and carefully position it on top of the SoC chip.  Using the hot glue gun, carefully add a couple of blobs of glue either side of the heatsink as shown.  I use a lot of my Pis on their sides, so after some time the heatsinks slide off - the glue helps prevent this.  To date the glue hasn't softened sufficiently in use to lose integrity (it melts at around 120\u00b0C, so it shouldn't!)The procedure for mounting a heatsink on the RAM chip is the same except you'll have to cut away some of the grill in the underside of the case to allow enough space.

The outside mainly consists of a glass cylinder.With more than 40 steps it has become quite a comprehensive Instructable. It starts with the design of the lamp. This covers both the 3D design in Fusion 360, and the electrical part. Extra attention is given to the power consumption of the LEDs. For example, a special board has been designed for power distribution.After the design the Instructable continues with the assembly of the various parts: The LED holder and the lamp foot. The LED holder contains 16 strips with 18 LEDs each, giving a total of 288 LEDs. The lamp base contains the Raspberry Pi, a small fan and additional electronic components.In addition to designing and building, the programming of the lamp is described. This starts with controlling the LEDs and retrieving weather data with Python. Followed by the different functions of the lamp.The primary function of this lamp is to display weather data. Due to the chosen design it is possible to use this lamp for other purposes.

All the LEDs would have different colors depending on these values. This has never been developed into a working prototype because I got another idea, which resulted in this LED matrix lamp. Where displaying weather data is only one of the possibilities.While making some sketches, I came up to the following functions:Display the current temperature.            Displaying the expected minimum and maximum temperatures.             Displaying the expected precipitation for the next hour (blue = rain, white = snow).             Displaying the current wind speed, and if possible direction.The drawings above are a first design of this lamp. The possibilities of this lamp are not limited to displaying weather data. Using a Raspberry PI gives many more possibilities. Such as a clock, a plasma or lava lamp, and several social media indicators.There are 2 ways to place the LEDs inside a Lamp: A square grid or a spiral of LEDs. The spiral version is easier to build. But the LEDs slope a little when using a spiral, and therefore looks less beautiful. Beside, the color gradient will be harder to program. That's why I've chosen to create a LED grid using ws2812 LED strips.The ws2812 LED strip is placed vertically through the lamp, in a zigzag pattern. All LED connections are at the top or bottom of the cylinder. This gives space inside the cylinder, for the other electronic components.Because the first idea was to display weather data, I have chosen for 16 LEDs per row. This allows for 16 wind directions:N            NNE            NE            ENE      E            ESE            SE            SSE            S     SSW            SW            WSW            W            WNW            NW            NNWThe previous project \"Christmas tree ornament\" has been based on a regular icosahedron, with a circular window for each LED. This project gets a similar structure for the LEDs. But then inside a glass cylinder.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FRV/WK1K/J9OWAS3V/FRVWK1KJ9OWAS3V.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO4/F1Q7/IVO85NGI/FO4F1Q7IVO85NGI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO2/QJXZ/JBCJQ6XV/FO2QJXZJBCJQ6XV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: First Sketches & Desing"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The temperature during a year in the Netherlands is approximately between -10 and +30 degrees Celsius. It can get warmer or colder, but these are exceptions. The universal temperature colors are Red for hot, and Blue for cold. I've added a third color: Yellow. This gives more colors and makes the gradient more beautiful.The minimum and maximum temperatures change during the seasons. As a result, the temperature difference is never greater than 25 degrees. In other words, almost half of the entire color range.  To increase this range, a dynamic scale can be used. For example, the scale may depend on the month. The color blue can be 10 degrees Celsius in the summer, and -10 degrees Celsius in the winter.This scale should change slowly. For example:January    -10 to +15\nFebruary   -10 to +15\nMarch       -5 to +20\nApril       -5 to +20\nMay          0 to +25\nJune        +5 to +30\nJuly       +10 to +35\nAugust     +10 to +35\nSeptember   +5 to +30\nOctober      0 to +25\nNovember    -5 to +20\nDecember   -10 to +15The translation between temperature and color can be stored in a table.

This divided by the LED distance gives the number of LED rows. One thing to take into account is the sales length of the LED strips. Some are sold per meter.

That's why I opted for a strip of 74 LEDs per meter. The inner diameter of 70 mm also gives enough room for using a regular Raspberry Pi.The choice of the 74 LED/meter strip gives a diameter of about 7 centimeter (2,8 inch). The sketch (second image) determines all horizontal sizes for the final design. The previous step gave a rough calculation of the diameter. The following calculation is based on the specifications:16 LEDs x (5 mm + 8.78 mm) = 220.48 mm\n220.48 / pi = 70.18 mm (outer diameter)\n70.18 mm - 2.13 mm (thickness LED) = 68 mm (inner diameter)The sketch starts with two construction circles of 70 and 80 millimeter. Giving a maximum wall thickness of 10 mm. A rectangle of 5 x 2 mm is drawn on the inner circle. This represents the LED. A second rectangle of 12 x 2 mm is drawn near the first box. This gives a flat surface for the pcb-strip.A third circle, with a diameter of 20 mm, is placed outside the drawing. This circle goes through the outer corners of the LED, and gives a curved area around the LEDs. Measuring the location, of this circle, gives 45.5 mm from the center of the drawing.A final circle with a diameter 67 mm gives the inside markers for the LED strip.The 2 rectangles and the outher circle are copied 15 times in a circular pattern. With this sketch as result.It is possible to create this project with ws2812b pixel panels. These have a density of 1 LED/cm2. A total of 24 x 24 LEDs can be used inside this glass cylinder. A total of 576 LEDs, which doubles the resolution.I have chosen for the LED strips for various reasons: The panels are more expensive ($100 instead of $40) and require even more current (which gives more heat).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FDH/MJEF/J8KGWGDA/FDHMJEFJ8KGWGDA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1H/Z517/J8KGWO5H/F1HZ517J8KGWO5H.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 11: LEDs Choice"}, {"step": 12, "steps_text": "It takes only 18 steps to create this LED holder in Fusion 360.

The LED windows are made using a spere and an extracted rectangle of 5 x 5 mm. Both are copied (a total of 18) over a length of 227.4 mm. All these 18 windows are then copied (16 times 18) in a circular way.

The specified power usage is about 22 Watt/meter. This makes the total power usage 88 Watt. This is the maximum, with all LEDs at full brightness.The LEDs require a 5 Volt power source. And 88 Watt at 5 Volt results in a current of 17.6 Ampere. There are several 5 Volt power supplies available. For example: Power Source          | Current |  price  |  Size (lxbxh)\n----------------------+---------+---------+----------------\nMean Well LRS 50-5    |    10 A | \u20ac 15.00 | 100 x  80 x 30 \nMean Well LRS 75-5    |    15 A | \u20ac 22.00 | 100 x 100 x 30 \nMean Well LRS 150-5   |    26 A | \u20ac 30.00 | 200 x 100 x 40None of these power supplies fit inside the glass cylinder. The power supply is placed out of sight. The lamp is intended to display light effects. And will not be made to give maximum light output. The 75 Watt version is the closest to 88 Watt, and should give enough power for this project.The simplest method to limit power consumption is to limit the maximum brightness of all LEDs. By setting this to 50% the power consumption is limited to 9 Ampere. This makes it possible to use the 10 Ampere power source (this leaves 1 Amp for the Raspberry Pi).In order to limit the power consumption, I have developed a different software solution. With which it's possible that certain LEDs give more than 50% output.Each LED uses 0,3 Watt. This equals 60 mA at 5 Volt. This is the current for the maximum white light output. Each ws2812 LED contains 3 small LEDs (red, green and blue). And white light is made out of 3 colors: red, green and blue. And each individual color takes 20 mA.All LEDs (for this lamp) at a single output color (red, green or blue) takes 18 x 16 x 20 mA =  5.76 Ampere. The required current, for a single color, is below 9 Ampere. There is no need to maximize the LED output at 50% when using a single color for all LEDs. A current of 9 Ampere can power (9A / 20 mA) 450 colors (red, green or blue) at maximum output. But there are (288 x 3) 864 small LEDs which can use this current. The ws2812 LEDs are indiviually controlled by three values from 0 to 255. The value 0 equals off, the value 128 equals half power and 255 equals maximum output. And it takes 3 x 288 bytes to change all colors of all LEDs. The idea is to limit the sum of all output bytes to a certain value. And this value represents a current of 9 Ampere. If the output of all 864 bytes is more than this value, all output values are reduced. in the following example example is not enough power available for the requested output, and the ouput is reduced to 78%:9 Ampere divided by 20mA equals 450 colors at full brightness\nTotal maximum output equals: 450 (LEDs) x 255 (value) = 114,750\n\nHalf the LEDs (144) at full brightness (255) and half the LEDs full blue:\n144 x 255 (red) + 144 x 255 (green) + 144 x 255 (blue) = 110,160\n144 x   0 (red) + 144 x   0 (green) + 144 x 255 (blue) =  36,720 \n\nThe requested output (146,880) exceeds the maximum output (114,750)\nCorrection = 0.78 \n\nNew values:\n144 x 199 (red) + 144 x 199 (green) + 144 x 199 (blue) = 85,968 \n144 x   0 (red) + 144 x   0 (green) + 144 x 199 (blue) = 28,656", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FNP/9TTP/J8KGVH6Q/FNP9TTPJ8KGVH6Q.LARGE.jpg", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png"], "step_title": "Step 13: Power Supply"}, {"step": 14, "steps_text": "The following code implements limiting the current for the ws2812 LEDs.

The main loop reads 3 values and calls a fuction to alter the color of the LEDs. And after a second the main loop starts again.The setColor function adds all input RGB values multiplied by the number of LEDs. If this value exceeds a treshold (3 x 215 x 24, equals 1 Ampere) the output values are reduced by a factor. This way the output value always stays below 1 Ampere.The value of 3 x 215 doesn't allow all RGB values at a maximum output, but it allows 2 colors at maximum output.This method maximizes the output of the power supply.

The upper part is for the 3mm GND-wire, the middle part is for the 3mm VCC wire and the lower part for the separate (AWG24) wires to the LEDs and the Raspberry Pi. To reduce the number of fuses, I have decided to connect two LED strips to a single fuse. This gives a total of 10 (8 LEDs + 1 Raspberry Pi + 1 fan) fuses. The PTC fuses have a nominal value of 1.85 Amps and a trip value of 3 Amps at 40 degrees Celsius. These currents require AWG 22 wires. The price difference between these wires is minimal, and it saves 8 fuses.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWY/X70O/J9JFKQOI/FWYX70OJ9JFKQOI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOO/MWT9/JA8JFM5W/FOOMWT9JA8JFM5W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIN/3EUU/JA8JFM5X/FIN3EUUJA8JFM5X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNO/JLRL/JA8JS1JW/FNOJLRLJA8JS1JW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 19: Power Distribution Board"}, {"step": 20, "steps_text": "3D printed ribs are used to keep the LEDs in place.

But there are only 2 spare LEDs on each strip.The first and last LED of the strip are used: Remove the wires from the LED strip. This gives large solder pads on both sides (even the manufacturer doesn't cut exactly between two LEDs). Cut off 18 LEDs and include the solder path of the 19th LED.

They each have a clean large solder pad on one side (as a result from cutting off LED 19). Lay down all LED strips, with these clean solder pads facing upwards towards the top. The most left-hand strip should have an arrow pointing downwards, And the next one must have an upward arrow. Repeat this for all LED strips (up-down-up-down....).Lay the LEDs facing towards the table. Remove some of the adhesive strip on the back: Approximately one half inch at the bottom, and until the third LED at the top. Don't forget to remove the adhesive layer.The LED strips are soldered at the backside, and not at the frontside. And the power connection isn't at the same place as the signal wire. Take 16 red and 16 brown wires (AWG 20) of 10 cm (4 inches). Strip a few millimeters from one side, and slightly more from the other side. The long side is later soldered to the power distribution board.Solder the red wires on the positive side of the LED strips, and the brown wires on the negative sides (the direction of the LED strips alternates). Solder these wires on to the third solder island, in the direction of the LED strip.Then solder 8 signal wires (AWG24) at the bottom of the LED strips. These wires are about 5 cm (2 inches) long. First strip off a few mm on both sides. Solder the wires towards the LED strip. This results in 8 times 2 LED strips.Solder a signal wire (5 cm, AWG24) to 7 LED strips with the arrows pointing downwards. The 8th LED strip gets a longer wire (40 cm, AWG24). This wire will be connected to the raspberry pi. Do not solder these 8 parts together yet, the signal wires are further soldered after assembly.Finally, this results in 8 times 2 connected LED strips like the first photo. The signal from the Raspbery Pi should be able to go from the top right corner to the upper left corner (zigzag). Test the 8 (dual) LED strips before placing them into the lamp.The following code comes from Adafruit. It's a simple test, and doesn't light up all LEDs at once.

Many loops, if-then-else, functions and many other 3GL features. But I quickly switched to a class. The first goal was to control all the lights by a matrix with 288 color values. After this worked, I slowly started adding functions. Optimizations were also made between different versions. For example: def initRain(self):\n    for i in range (self.xleds * self.yleds):\n        self.rainArray.append (i)\n        self.rainArray[i] = self.black\n\ndef initWind(self):\n    for i in range (self.xleds * self.yleds):\n        self.windArray.append (i)\n        self.windArray[i] = self.blackCan be written as:self.rainArray = [self.black] * self.yleds * self.xleds\nself.windArray = [self.black] * self.yleds * self.xledsIn the next two steps the rain and the wind are programmed. Both with the Neopixel LEDs as with simulated Neopixels. The used program examples are far from complete, but they show the basic principle.

I calculated the electrical part for 288 LEDs. It turned out that the real power consumption is lower than the specified power consumption. And I have adjusted the power supply accordingly.This lamp is still designed to give light at full output. There is enough power, the wires and fuses can handle the currents, and the fan keeps the temperature in control. I've provided enough detail to build this lamp with a smaller power supply. It's possible to use a 10 Amps power supply, or even a 5 Amps power supply. This allows for thinner wires, and less fuses. Even the fan can be omitted. The only drawback is that the LEDs can only light up at half power (or less). But the LEDs give enough light at low values (This lamp is not made to illuminate an entire room). Most images in this Instructable are taken at half of the regular output. Otherwise it was not possible to take pictures (first image).During the fastening of the LEDs the wires turned out to be quite stiff. This made it difficult to attach these wires to the PDB. This would probably have been easier, if the LED holder was divided in four or six parts. Divided horizontal for print size, and vertical for assembly.It's possible to replace the printed LED holder by a 60mm PVC tube. The LEDs have to be glued onto the tube, which alters the way of soldering. But the wiring diagram remains the same. This project can then probably be made without a 3D printer. All in all, this Instructable has become a bit longer than I had in mind. But I am very satisfied with the end result. Both the hardware part and the software part. The code will probably require some small changes in the future.

The middle picture is with the shop lights on. This thing is stupid bright. A typical 60W light bulb throws off 800 lumens, this will (minimum) throw off 10x that. People don't see increased brightness on at a linear rate either, so make sure to protect your eyes. You only get one pair. TROUBLESHOOTINGLight won't stay on?You either don't have a powerful enough power supply (100W+), or your power supply is detecting the sudden rush of .1-3A as a short. If it's the latter, try dialing down your current, then gradually taking it up.Light never came on?Check your connections. Check your solder joints. Check the polarity. Inspect the converter, mine was broken when it arrived. One of the mosfets wasn't connected, I fixed it, and the seller sent me a new one.There's an annoying, high pitched whine!This is a PWM problem. They've chosen a switching frequency you can hear.

I am new to prototyping/circuits\u00a0and only took two semester of Java courses, so when I went looking for simple projects to build my skills, I was\u00a0disappointed at how complex some of the code I saw was. While there are many other projects out there, with almost exactly the same in functionality, they were just too complex for the simplicity of the project. I believe I have put together a version that is much simpler and one that anyone can follow. In doing so, there may be some\u00a0sacrifices\u00a0in robustness(delay haters) but It works great so who really cares.\u00a0 Let's talk about the exact functionality. We are sensing distance all the time and have an rgb LED to indicate whether to keep coming, slow down, stop, or go back. A button is used to store the current distance as the desired parking distance. Even though the LED is super low power consumption, I am an environmentalist, so lets program in a power save mode to turn off the LED when there is no car in the garage and around 30 seconds after the car has parked in the right spot. Also, we cannot expect that the car will be parked at the exact, down to the inch, distance it was set at, so we will include a range of about 6 inches. You don't want to end up moving back and forth a dozen times before you get in right*. This is a big improvement over ones you can buy at Home Depot that only have 1, 2, and 3 foot distance settings and only 3 indicator stages. Plus, all the big box store ones look cheap and all have this ugly two part design where the LED or sensor are on a pull string. Not what I want in a classy garage. If you then want to make it smaller, cheaper and more permanent, plus, not have to leave your\u00a0Arduino\u00a0in it, flash the software over to an ATtiny85-20PU. \u00a0We will go over all the required steps to use the Arduino as the ISP to load the software to the ATtiny.First lets gather some parts along with some approximate prices $15 - Arduino(any will do) Projet housing $3 - HC-SR04 Ultrasonic distance sensor $4 - Breadboard $1 - RGB LED (I prefer one that has a high brightness rating and is frosted)\u00a0 $2 - Button $1 - 3 resistors ~ 220 ohm (this all really depends on the strength of the LED you choose) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 1 resistor ~ 10k ohm ( button) $1 - Jumpers\u00a0 $3 - Power supply - You have a few options here depending on whether you chose to leave the Arduino board inside or use the ATtiny85 If you choose to use the ATtiny then you will need $2 - ATtiny85 $2 - DC input jack $1 - 5V regulator $1 - 2x 10uf electrolytic capacitors\u00a0 ~ or ~ $4 - Breadboard power supply", "title": "Ultrasonic Garage Parking Assistant With Arduino and an ATtiny85", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Ultrasonic-Garage-Parking-Assistant-with-Arduino/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "A great project box for this tupperware. It is particularly good\u00a0because\u00a0it is most of the time transparent and even better, it is often frosted. This is all important in spreading the light of the LED to make it as visible as possible. Also, its widely available, cheap and easy to cut. I used the plastic box that came with my Arduino starter kit, which turned out to work quite nicely.Cut two holes for the ping sensor This by far the trickiest part. You want try to get them as snug as possible so that you dont have to get out the hot glue gun. The sensors are 16mm wide, so its doubtful that the average person has a drill bit of that nature lying around. This may not be the most orthodox method of cutting holes but with the soft plastic, it worked for me.\u00a0 First, I drilled a pilot hole in the exact center of where each whole needed to be. Using some sharp\u00a0scissors, I pushed it through the hole and twisted* allowing the wedge shape of the scissor blade to widen the hole as I twisted\u00a0until\u00a0it was wide enough for the sensor to fit through. Repeat for the other sensor hole.Cut a hole for the button Placing the button on the exterior of the box is crucial for easy access to setting your desired distance. A button with threads and a nut are perfect for this.\u00a0Cut a hole for the power plug Depending on how you plan to power the device will affect what kind of hole you make, I used a 5.5x2.1mm DC power jack to connect it to \u00a0a 9V power adapter.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FAU/0S49/HHJOKLOJ/FAU0S49HHJOKLOJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC3/3PGI/HHJOKLOD/FC33PGIHHJOKLOD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F97/J5RP/HHJOKLOE/F97J5RPHHJOKLOE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYO/TBIL/HHJOKLOG/FYOTBILHHJOKLOG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Build a Project Box"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "To make this easier to understand lets break the circuit into 3 parts. The LED, the Button and the Ping sensor. Note, in the photos, I have wired my rails backwards. This is to accomodate the 5V regulator(optional). I realize now that I could have turned it around, used the other rails to not have it backwards but owell.UPDATE:\u00a0Adjustment have been made to the circuit diagram. (not reflected in photos) The LED has been routed to pins 0 & 1 in order to use PWM for brightness control. This is important in getting a nice yellow color.\u00a0The LED Connect the common cathode (longest pin) of the LED to a 5V rail on your breadboard. The other 3 pins, require a resistor between them and the connection to the arduino I/O pin. Here is a helpful website to find the kind of resistor you will need http://led.linear1.org/1led.wiz. This is a pull up style circuit so the code will be inverted, high will be off and low will be on. You may use a resistor on the common cathode to not have this situation. I did this because I did not realize the ATtiny85 had pwm pins and I wanted to dim the green LED some by adding 2 resistors. When using red and green to make yellow, green was just too dominant over red an it looked yellow-green. A future fix is to move the green connection to a pwm pin and dim the green via pwm. Here's a link to a more complete tutorial on LED circuits\u00a0http://www.ladyada.net/learn/arduino/lesson3.htmlThe Button Connect 5V to a lead of the button. Connect a 10k ohm resistor between ground and the other lead on the button. Connect a jumper from the arduino to the ground lead of the button. While a common breadboard button will work okay, but if you plan to move it into a project box, it may be a hassle to reach the button. We want to have easy access to the button so that you won't have to move the sensor to press the button, that would make setting your distance quite difficult. I used a threaded momentary button from\u00a0radio shack. Im not sure if it needs the resistor like the smaller breadboard button but I left it in and it works fine. \u00a0Here's a link to a more complete tutorial on buttons\u00a0http://arduino.cc/en/tutorial/button.\u00a0The Ping Sensor Simply connect 5V and GND to your corresponding rails and the echo and trigger pins to the arduino.

We now what to install the NewPing library, Here is a link on instructions to download and install the NewPing library http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/NewPing. If you plan on using the ATtiny then part of the file NewPing.cpp must be edited. There are two big section of the code devoted to timers, comment all of this out. NewPing.h can be left alone. It is important to use this library and NOT to perform the distance\u00a0measurement\u00a0manually. The reason is because when the ping sensor cannot return a distance, it will delay for a full second instead of multiple times per second like it should. This is a problem when pulling the car in and there is no response from the unit for a brief period. In that time a car can move several feet and make the device useless. This library fixes that issue thus maintaing responsiveness.\u00a0 The pin arrangement will be however you chose to connect up your arduino board, so be sure to adjust this code to work with your circuit. Remember, if you want to use pwm to get your color brightness just right be sure to use pins with a ~ symbol for your LED or refer to the ATtiny85 pinout diagram for pwm pins. I did not include any use of the blue pin, simply because the ATtiny85 does not have enough pins without reprograming the reset pin to be I/O. I\u00a0didn't\u00a0bother to do so. You may want to add some new colors or change it up to suit your mood.\u00a0If you need a more precise indication, you may want to lower the range value to 1 or 2 (keep in mind that its +/-, so a 2 for the range variable will give a 4 inch range)\u00a0or bring it up higher if you have room to spare. You may also want to edit the distances at which each color of LED will change. I found 120 and 50 inches to be just right.\u00a0UPDATE:\u00a0LED has been moved to pins 0 & 1. The yellow() method has been updated to include PWM.

I will show you the steps required to shrink all of this down to a chip the size of your thumbnail. First we need to install ATtiny support to Arduino IDE.\u00a0 Locate your Arduino sketchbook folder (you can find its location in the preferences dialog in the Arduino software) Create a new sub-folder called \u201chardware\u201d in the sketchbook folder, if it doesn\u2019t exist already. Download attiny-master.zip folder from below and copy the \u201cattiny\u201d folder (not the attiny-master folder) from the unzipped ATtiny master.zip to the \u201chardware\u201d folder. You should end up with folder structure like Documents > Arduino > hardware > attiny Restart the Arduino development environment. You should see ATtiny entries in the Tools > Board menu. A great tutorial to this can be found here\u00a0http://hlt.media.mit.edu/?p=1695Uploading software to ATtiny85 The Arduino board can be used as a\u00a0programmer\u00a0for the ATtiny chips. To do so plug the ATtiny chip into a breadboard and wire a breadboard in the following way. 1. With jumpers, connect VCC to 5V and GND to GND. Connect pin 10 to Reset, 11 to pin 0, 12 to pin 1, 13 to pin 2. 2. Open the program ArduinoISP from File -> Examples -> ArduinoISP. Upload it to the board. 3. Connect a 10uf capacitor between Reset and GND of the Arduino board. 4. Now open a blank program, only void() and setup() methods are present and are blank. (Im not sure about this step but I tried doing it with code in it and it broke the ATtiny)\u00a0 5. Select from Tools -> Board -> ATtiny85 (internal 8MHz clock) \u00a0and select from Tools -> Programmer -> Arduino as ISP. Upload the blank program. (you should see 2 avrdude errors. Not to worry, this is normal) 6. Select from Tools -> burn bootloader. This changes clock speed from its default 1MHz to 8MHz. 7. Now go back to the parking sensor code and upload it. Be sure to have the correct board and programmer selected. (you should see the same two avrdude errors) If everything went smoothly, carefully pull the ATtiny out and transplant it back into your breadboard circuit. Next, we need to modify the circuit. Because we are removing the Arduino board from the equation, we are also losing its regulated power supply, so we need to make our own. This will require 2x 10uf electrolytic capacitor and a 5V regulator. The Regulator Connect the incoming positive voltage to the input lead and the negative to negative lead of 10 uf capacitor, connect these two leads to their respective input and negative pin on the regulator. Arrange this on the bread board so that a the negative and output pins are plugged into a vertical rail. Add another 10 uf capacitor after the 5V regulator on the vertical rails, to their respective lead, of course. The capacitors smooth out the voltage. I am using a 9V DC power adapter, this is low enough to not require a heat-sink on the regulator but if you go higher, then you might need to add one. Now that the circuit is modified, let's get it on* the ATtiny85. Here is a helpful instructable that I used myself\u00a0https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-make-your-own-Arduino-board/step3/Adding-the-5v-regulator/. All that's left is to connect up a power source!Future Changes Switch the 5V regulator to have the correct corresponding +/- rails. Use the calculated resistors for the LED Use PWM to adjust brightness to get yellow just right Add a piezo element for an audible indication Use an RGB LED strip instead of just one LED.

As you float through the ransacked city, most of the buildings appear to be on fire inside.  If you look at what's going on, they're shining colored lights on a sheet of fabric, which is being blown by fans, making fairly believable fire.  Creating this same look can be an awesome addition to a Halloween display, and is both simple, and fairly cheep.  There are several ways of accomplishing the look, but this is one of the easiest, and most straightforward.  I have a more complex version currently in the design phase, but it'll have to wait till next year.  :)  The final effect pictures, and video, show a few other window embellishments; this instructable focuses simply on the fire.Excluding a trip to the hardware store, this can be done in about an hour.The video doesn't quite convey the contrasting light and dark as well as seeing in person, but this gives a pretty good feel for how it looks:", "title": "Flaming Windows", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Flaming-Windows/", "section": "home", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "There isn't much to this build, and you may already have some of the essentials sitting at home.Per window:2 - 150-Watt Incandescent Clamp Lights1 - Red bulb 1 - Orange bulb 3 - 2x4 boards White sheet, or similar fabric FanScrews/Staples/NailsThe clamp lights are found at most home improvement stores, usually in the electrical section (by the extension cords, etc.).  Unless you're doing a really small window, be sure to get the ones with the larger bell on them.  There is a smaller version, but they don't reflect as much light.Measure your window to determine how much fabric you'll need, as well as length of 2x4 boards.  For the board measurements, determine the overall height from the floor.  You'll build a large H shape, using 3 boards.For smaller windows, you might want to purchase some plain white fabric from a craft/fabric store.  For larger windows, it works best if you just have an old white sheet that you don't mind putting some holes in.  If not, check your local Goodwill, etc., as they usually have some.  The key here is that you want the fabric to make the span across the whole window, but have enough so that it hangs somewhat loose.  So make sure you have a few inches more than the overall width of window you're covering.  You can cheat a bit on the height, it doesn't need to cover the whole thing, top to bottom, but make sure you have some wiggle room on the width.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FR1/3YYA/I20HMLN3/FR13YYAI20HMLN3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F47/S00L/I20HMLME/F47S00LI20HMLME.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Gathering Materials"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Once you've determined the height, and width you need, the rest is a piece of cake.  First, build an H-shaped frame with the 2x4s.  So you get something like this:|      |\n|      |\n|      |\n--------\n|      |\nMeasure the height from the floor, to the bottom window frame, and attach the crossbar at that same height on the vertical pieces.  You want the crossbar, right at about the same height as the bottom of your window frame, so the lights start right at the bottom.The crossbar should go on what will be the room-facing side, to allow as much separation as possible between the fabric, and lights.Put a couple screws for each intersection, and call it good.  You don't need a whole lot of stability, but enough to keep it from falling in on itself.The fabric should go on what will be the window-facing side, again to allow separation between fabric and lights.Now drape your fabric, or sheet, across the frame, and make a decision on what the future holds for your chosen piece of fabric.  If you're just borrowing a white sheet from an in-use bed, you could just put a few clamps on it and hold it in place, but you're better off just sacrificing the material.  For me, I used a hand staple gun, and attached it in 5 or 6 spots on either side.  Small nails would work too.  Just be sure it is loosly draped between the two posts, but not overly so.  Just enough to allow some movement, when the fan blows on it; it's not an exact science.One benefit of stapling/nailing the sheet:  when you're all done, you can just detach the crossbar, and roll everything up, to store for next year.With the clamp lights, put an orange light in one, and a red in the other (doesn't matter which).  !CAUTION!LIGHTS GENERATE HEAT.BE SURE TO TEST AND MAKE SURE THE SHEET DOESN'T COME IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE LIGHTS.!CAUTION!The crossbar serves as a good mount point for the lights, but be very careful to keep the bulbs away from the sheet.  The light bells themselves don't get warm, especially with the fan blowing, but it's a good idea to try and keep them away from the sheet as well.  Direct the lights so they each point toward the center of the structure, NOT towards the window itself.Position a fan underneath everything, about in the middle.  Depending on your fan's overall output, you may need to lift it off the floor a bit.  The one I used was pretty good, on the High setting.Here's how it looks, from the inside:And that's all there is too it!  Turn off all the rest of the lights in the room, and head outside to admire your devilishly flaming windows!

Three segments were used for the base and the two long sides of the planter, with the remaining two short ends of the planter being cut from the remaining 4\u2019 segment.

Nine additional pilot holes were drilled in each of the two shorter sides of the container as well; three along each joint. They should be somewhat equally spaced.

Make two, 45\u00b0 cuts on the ends of each segment to from two braces, as shown in the figure above.\nOnce you have the three remaining pieces, start by attaching the horizontal shelf by itself. It is important that you do not make the shelf level with the top of the box, unless you plan on filling the box completely with soil (with no lip of wood remaining around your plants). The height of this intended lip is how low the top of the shelf should be. Ideally, you will want the bottom of the bucket to be level with the soil. During construction, I chose to place it 1\u201d lower from the top of the box to make sure the plants will have enough soil. (However, I would recommend installing it 2-3\" \u00a0below the top of the planter, now that my planter is complete)\nCarefully measure this distance below the height of the container and mark it.

Completely level is ideal, but placing the bucket too high will increase your flow rate, and placing the bucket too low will leave more stagnant water in the reservoir. It is up to you to choose on which side you would prefer to error. Also keep in mind that if you place the bucket too high, it can be an easy fix by simply placing more soil in the planter to raise the level.\nIf you are content with knowing this, please skip to the next section, otherwise read on.\nThere is really only one equation you need to know to design a gravity irrigation system: Bernoulli\u2019s equation, as shown below.\nThis equation is basically a restatement of the principle of conservation of energy, only applied to an incompressible continuum. Water can be assumed as such for a majority of applications, including this one. The equation states that for any location, or node, within a closed system, the dynamic pressure plus the gravitational field effect plus the static pressure will be equal to an unchanging system constant. The dynamic pressure is equal to the density of the water multiplied by the velocity at the node, divided by 2. The gravitational field effect is the density of the water, multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s2), multiplied by the height of the node, taken from an arbitrary, but constant, reference point. The static pressure is simply the force divided by the area at the node. Finally, the system constant is a potential constant offset of the entire system, which can be zero.\nAs a simple example of how to use this equation, let the elevation of the soil be our vertical height reference and let the system be built so that the bottom of the water reservoir is level with the soil. When the bucket it filled with 5 inches of water, what will be the instantaneous velocity of the water at the emitters? By examining a node at the top of the water level in the bucket, the velocity the height is moving down is negligible, so there is zero dynamic pressure. For the static pressure, we know that Earth has an innate pressure level of about 1 atmosphere, and at the top of the water in the reservoir, this is the only pressure acting on that node. However, because we know that the final state of the water will be to return to atmosphere in the planter, we can choose to ignore this value, as it will simply be a static offset for the entire system. This leaves the gravitation field effect equal to the system constant at this node, and defines the system constant for the entire system and is equal to the density of the water, multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity, multiplied by 5 inches.\nWe can now examine the node of one of the emitters at the location the water is released into the planter. Here, we are interested in knowing the velocity of the water, therefore we will be solving for the dynamic pressure. For the gravitational field effect, we defined this height as the reference point, therefore the height and gravitational field effect is zero. The static pressure is once again the atmospheric pressure of Earth, which we already canceled out from earlier; therefore we must do the same here. And finally, we already calculated the system constant from the first node. This leaves the dynamic pressure at node 2 equal to the gravitational field effect at node 1. The velocity at node 2 can then be solved, as shown below.\nTo discover the total leak rate of the system, you then just need to multiply this velocity by the cross-sectional area of the emitter and number of emitters in the system. But keep in mind this is only the instantaneous leak rate at the current height of water in the reservoir; as the water height decreases as time goes on, the leak rate will also decrease. If you with to know exactly how long your planter will be watered and at what rate, you will need to use a write a simple script with the actual dimensions of your system. This can be accomplished by discretizing time (with each step being on the order of seconds) and continually calculating the leak rate and volume loss at each step.

The filter you use must be a few sizes smaller than the hole you intend to keep free, so 50 micron filter paper was used.

Due to the connections, it will be a few inches longer than 4 feet. Attempt to place the length of pipe in the wood container horizontally and measure the additional length you will need to remove. Pull one of the 90 degree corners off of the length of pipe and cut the measured length off of the PVC pipe. Reattach the 90 degree corner and confirm the length of pipe can now fit horizontally in the container.\nNext, you will need to measure and mark the locations of the emitters. The system shown here was constructed with eight emitters, each placed 6 inches from each other. Measure 3 inches from one side, mark the location, then continue measuring and marking every 6 inches. There should be 3 inches left from the far side when you are complete.\nWith the locations marked, it is time to drill the holes. If you are using a micro drill bit (gauge #80 through #61), do not use a hand drill. Because the bits are so small, you can not use them to hold the weight of the drill and you will snap the bits easily. You can probably use a drill press, as long as it stabile enough. I attempted this on a cheap drill press, but it continually broke the bit. I finally used a CNC machine with a controlled feed rate and it worked perfectly.

Cut two segments of 0.5\u201d diameter polyethylene tubing and attach each to one of the Nylon adapters you purchased. The Nylon adapters must also be screwed into the threads of the 90 degree PVC corners. Attach the opposite end of one of the tubing to the bucket you created earlier and suspend it slightly above the PVC pipe. Make sure the emitters are facing down and you can then suspend the PVC piping above a number of cups, each oriented below one of the emitters, as shown in the figure above. If you only care about the uniformity, put a little bit of water in the bucket, then leave it until it runs out (NOTE: Make sure you see water in the far tubing that is exposed to the air, otherwise you will need raise the bucket for a moment to purge the air from the system). After a certain amount of time, you can then remove the system and measure the volume in the cups.\nThe above experiment was carried out with this system, with water volume measured every 20 minutes. The results are shown above and support Bernoulli\u2019s equation with negligible friction. In the second figure, the red lines represent each individual emitter and the blue lines represent the compete system. The final figure shows the distribution in the water volume measured from each emitter. While emitter 2 is unusually low (perhaps due to a partial clog), the other emitters appear to be somewhat uniform. If you are not satisfied with the uniformity test, you can attempt to unclog any potentially blocked emitters by flushing water through the PVC pipe and attempted to force air through the emitters with your mouth (it may look strange, but it works). If you test it again and the uniformity has remained unchanged, you can potentially drill additional emitters.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FNF/E97M/H2G607NQ/FNFE97MH2G607NQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJJ/GRB7/H1ZG85KM/FJJGRB7H1ZG85KM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFA/7W9H/H1YOJ1UV/FFA7W9HH1YOJ1UV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 13: PVC Emitters (2)"}, {"step": 14, "steps_text": "Once you are satisfied with the uniformity, the next step is to form the polyethylene piping.

If you attempt to simply force it into place without heat, it will resist and buckle, potentially cutting off the flow of water or damaging the tubing, resulting in a leak. My first attempted was to use an open flame from a lighter; however, I could not keep a large enough section of the tubing hot long enough to bend it into shape. Also, the impurities from the flame blacked the plastic quickly. Instead, a heat gun was used and formed the segments of tubing shown above, with the pictures taken after assembly (NOTE: I suspect you could use a propane camping stove to apply the heat with perhaps some increased difficulty in forming). You will need one segment that turns 180 degrees, a segment that is turns 90 degrees, a straight segment 1.5 feet long, and a straight segment ~4 inches long. The above images should help you complete the assembly.\nBoth ends of the pipe need to be open to atmosphere in order to easily purge the air from the system after water is added.

Once you begin filling it with soil, it is going to get heavy and may be difficult to move afterwards. Pour in a layer of drainage rock and spread it across the bottom so that you can no longer see the wood. For the rock used here, the thickness of this layer ended up being 0.75 inches. This layer of rocks has a few benefits in case the container is over-watered: 1) It will help prevent soil from running out the bottom of the container. 2) The roots of the plants will not grow into the rocks and be sitting in a pool of water as it drains out the bottom. This can help reduce mold from attacking the plants roots.\nOnce the layer of rocks has been placed, fill with soil and fertilize as recommended on the packages.\nWith the limited space available in the planter, do not be afraid to plant a few types of varieties of plants together. You will have to research to make sure the plants require similar soil conditions and are not detrimental to each other, but when done correctly, it is an efficient use of space. I am not an expert in this, but for this planter, we are planting strawberries and spinach. Both require slightly acidic soil (strawberries: 5.5 to 6.5 ph, spinach: 6.4 to 6.8 ph) and the small spinach plants can be placed around the larger strawberry plants easily.\nThere are plenty of websites on the internet to help you determine excellent pairings of produce, as well as the correct spacing of the plants.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FXL/V5V3/H27LSH0P/FXLV5V3H27LSH0P.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 15: Soil Layering and Plant Placement"}, {"step": 16, "steps_text": "And the planter is complete! I also included a strip of copper tape around the base of the container to ward off snails, which has worked far better than expected. Copper is believed to react with the slime produced by both snails and slugs, inadvertently giving them a kind of electric shock when they touch it. The tape is a little expensive, so I would not include it unless you start observing a problem on your own. If you do decide to apply it, make sure you purchase tape that is at least 1.25 inches wide. Snails and slugs can stretch across distances shorter than this, so it will not be effective. The tape shown in the image below is 2 inches wide, just to make sure they are blocked. When applying the tape, I would make sure it is not directly along the bottom of the container (I placed it 1 inch above the bottom). If you do over-water, you do not want it to touch the copper tape, as it easily oxidizes when wet. I do not know if this affects the effectiveness of the material against these pests, but I would suspect it would if the oxidation is bad enough.\nApplying to the Bernoulli equation to the dimensions of the planter, we can see an excellent agreement from measuring the height of the water in the bucket as shown in the figures below. An interesting note, though, is that while the model agrees exceedingly well, the model was completed with an emitter diameter of 200 microns (0.2 mm), instead of the 300 micron diameter of the #80 drill bit actually used to from the holes. This could be due to a number of factors: 1) The force due to drilling stretched the PVC pipe as it drilled, and then bounced back once the bit was removed, 2) The PVC pipe slightly swells with contact with water, or 3) The resistance in the emitters is not negligible. None of these explanations sound completely believable to me, but I am also not too concerned about it. Besides, smaller emitters without a noticeable reduction in uniformity is ideal. If I was building a larger system, I would definitely want to determine the cause of this observation, but for this small scale example, it is actually a positive effect, independent of the cause.And there you have it!

kind that you assemble with an interlocking flange.\u00a0 Though not quite large enough to use for the entire diameter, it was easy enough to modify to make larger.\u00a0 First I traced the dome onto a sheet of plate steel.\u00a0 Then I cut a 1 inch ring around it.\u00a0 I then cut thin pie sections all along the outer ring, going to the center ring.\u00a0 This creates tabs which you bend up.\u00a0 Create your tube by bending the stove pipe around the flange on R2\u2019s dome.\u00a0 Lock in place just at the dome with some duct tape.\u00a0 Then insert the plate in the bottom and tighten the stove pipe around it.\u00a0 Drill and rivet the stove pipe in at least 4 places and remove the tape.\u00a0 It should now be locked together.\u00a0 Remove the dome and start drilling through the base of the tube into the tabs on the bottom plate.\u00a0 Rivet or weld in place.\u00a0 If your tube is larger then mine you should be able to fit everything in the tube.\u00a0 Mine just didn\u2019t have space for the thermostat switch so I made a small box which protrudes from the back.\u00a0 Again the sizes will need to be determined by you, my dome should have been wider then it

Paint on finishing touches and allow to dry 25. Paint and fit new black center eye 26. Write an Instructable for it? About the Paint. I used a variety of paints for this build.\u00a0 You can see in some of the pictures that the tank is all ready white.\u00a0 The reason for being that I hadn\u2019t really thought the process through and thought I\u2019d save time by pre-painting part of it.\u00a0 This doesn\u2019t really work well though as there was way too much fitting, welding and refitting to be done before painting could begin.\u00a0 So first holes were drilled for the wiring and then the entire unit was welded together.\u00a0 With a little grinding it looked oh-so nice and shiny.\u00a0 I was very tempted not to paint it, as I often am with builds like this.\u00a0 It seems a shame to cover up metal work like this but this was always in the design.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure a carpenter feels the same if he milled ornate crown moulding with no fillers used only flawless process.\u00a0 Then the buyer promptly paints it right in front of him, covering up all his work... Anyway, the first paint I used was high heat enamel, kinda like a white version of barbeque paint.\u00a0 It looked nice and covered well but was not suited for the job.\u00a0 It scratched off so easy, not something that\u2019s going to hold up well in a busy kitchen.\u00a0 Then I thought of using your typical rust paint like Tremclad or Rustoleum, but decided against it.\u00a0 These rust paints are durable, but they are soft for so long.\u00a0 No I wanted something really tough and available without an environmental permit.\u00a0 Enter, Epoxy appliance paint.\u00a0 Resistant to scratches and chipping, scrubbable and somewhat quick drying.\u00a0 Tremclad would have taken many days to reach a working hardness, the epoxy took 12 hours to get really hard and 24 hours for a diamond cure. The blue anodize paint is similar to the enamel, weak indeed.\u00a0 Looks great, but scratches easy.\u00a0 I ended up using it anyway, but top coated it with a enamel clear coat.\u00a0 It seems ok, but I guess only time will tell. Other details, shadows and lines were completed with a combination of a sharpie pen, model paints and I have to admit some of wife and daughters nail polish.\u00a0 Don\u2019t laugh great colours and a nice hard finish.\u00a0 This was clear coated as well Finally the laser damage!\u00a0 This was easy actually, and not painted on as well, which is why it looks great.\u00a0 Instead I hooked the ground cable of my welder to the frame.\u00a0 Ground the paint off just the very center of where I wanted the laser to strike, and struck an arc dead center.\u00a0 This produces a blast of heat that scores the paint and metal in multiple directions providing the look of blaster damage.\u00a0 Clear coat and Bobs your uncle, in my case he really is!\u00a0 Hey Uncle Bob! That big beautiful black eye! Like I said at the beginning of this Instructable, I learned this trick off an astro-droid website.\u00a0 Get yourself a 2 liter pop bottle and empty it of its contents.\u00a0 Coco-cola would be my first choice but there bottle doesn`t work for this.\u00a0 Pepsi brand bottle are perfect.\u00a0 Just before the top of the bottle is the curved shoulder.\u00a0 Cut out a section larger then you need.\u00a0 Then out of this cut a circle ever so slightly larger than the size you need for the black eye, say 2mm larger.\u00a0 Paint the inside curve of the lens with black paint.\u00a0 The convex side will now be a glorious shiny black looking lens with the plastic forever protecting the paint behind it.\u00a0 Now just carefully squeeze it into the hole.\u00a0 At first you will think it won\u2019t fit, but if you use toothpicks as leverage bars the soft plastic will yield and suddenly pop into place.\u00a0 The gap where the metal of the eye piece and the dome meet is never perfectly flush, so the excess plastic of the lens fits in perfectly like a snap ring.\u00a0 If it gets damaged it\u2019s easy enough to poke with a razor blade in the middle and pry it out.\u00a0 Make a fresh one and wiggle the new lens in.\u00a0 I have made about 3 of them so far, not because they were damaged by others, but by me.\u00a0 Often I would want to see what it looked like, forget the lens in, and then do some welding on it or painting.\u00a0 So a new lens was required. Last minute I decided to make additional trim for the front.\u00a0 I wasn`t going to when I started this project thinking I would just paint it all on.\u00a0 But as it takes very little time to come sheet metal I thought why not.\u00a0 The trim was the section around the sound switch and the vents below the coffee grin holder.\u00a0 Once again, each to his/her own. Another idea I tried but just didn\u2019t work well was to aim a high intensity LED through the eyes of the coffee grind droid.\u00a0 These red lenses were designed for night viewing only and were designed to have just a faint glow as to not induce night blindness.\u00a0 They even had an option where if you turn the housing an iris would close \u00bd way and reduce the glow even further.\u00a0 A 1 watt star luxeon LED would barely light them up, and cast an icky glow on the coffee maker behind it, so I ditched that idea.\u00a0 Even tried shinning a laser pointer through them, this made them glow a little but the nature of a laser is to shine one beam.\u00a0 I would need either some kind of a splitter or 3 lasers, bah.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSZ/30R2/H1KHAMZI/FSZ30R2H1KHAMZI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9V/1CUG/H1JUJFZC/F9V1CUGH1JUJFZC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG8/UIQV/H1QMLDLP/FG8UIQVH1QMLDLP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRS/P7HG/H1QMLDLQ/FRSP7HGH1QMLDLQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5W/40QK/H1JUHH45/F5W40QKH1JUHH45.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNJ/BHNJ/H1JUHH4A/FNJBHNJH1JUHH4A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNS/VXSM/H1KHAMTJ/FNSVXSMH1KHAMTJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA6/K782/H1JUHH6U/FA6K782H1JUHH6U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8N/N3U1/H1PITAPG/F8NN3U1H1PITAPG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ4/17IH/H1PITAPL/FQ417IHH1PITAPL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAR/5ADF/H1QMLDSF/FAR5ADFH1QMLDSF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F03/XYOE/H1V5YFKO/F03XYOEH1V5YFKO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU7/Q447/H1WHV8R3/FU7Q447H1WHV8R3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4I/OWCP/H1V5YFMF/F4IOWCPH1V5YFMF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1A/71Y6/H1QMLKR2/F1A71Y6H1QMLKR2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM6/GFK8/H1V5YFLY/FM6GFK8H1V5YFLY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUK/VGWW/H1JUJSGU/FUKVGWWH1JUJSGU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7I/ZQE1/H1WHV8Q7/F7IZQE1H1WHV8Q7.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 12: Finishing the Look"}, {"step": 13, "steps_text": "Wiring up the coffee maker is easy, provided you didn\u2019t just cut the existing wires while taking the coffee maker apart.\u00a0 Most connections are done with connector clips.\u00a0 When these are undone while you take the unit apart, make sure to re-plug them back together as you go.\u00a0 If you do have to cut a wire, mark it with a piece of tape and a sharpie.\u00a0 When you wire up the unit just reconnect the wires as you go.\u00a0 Mine was a two burner unit though, so I end up just cutting off and sealing the wires I didn\u2019t need any more.\u00a0 The indicator light and switch just didn`t mesh with the design so I went for an old school toggle switch and a industrial indicator light.\u00a0 Installation was a snap and if you want to use the original BUNN light and switch you always can, a little trickier to cut out though.\u00a0 I was originally going to use them on the chest and you can see the rectangular holes I cut out for them.\u00a0 I decided against it, and thought about making a whole new body.\u00a0 Instead I cut out a patch panel to cover the holes instead.\u00a0 At first I was going to put the panel in the inside, and lightly weld and grind my mistake away, but decided I liked the look of the panel on the out side. Grounding the unit is very important; you don\u2019t need to fry yourself in the process of enjoying your coffee.\u00a0 Originally my unit had only one spot where it was grounded.\u00a0 I spoke to one of the electricians I work with about this and he said it should be fine as long as all steel components have a solid connection.\u00a0 I was a little dubious and decided to ground on not only the base of the unit, but also to the tank itself.\u00a0 The point where R2\u2019s dome meets the body should be fine, but I thought better safe than sorry.\u00a0\u00a0 If you are unsure about this you should have a licensed electrician give a once over.\u00a0 Most electricians will be happy to help, just bring the whole mess to them to have a look at.\u00a0 Haven`t met one yet who will charge for something like this, but you never know.\u00a0 If you\u2019re still worried, only plug the unit into a GFCI plug. Lastly the LED eye, this may seem like a silly way to power it but it was easy and free.\u00a0 I didn`t bother to use a switch for it as BUNN coffee makers don`t use a switch for the main tank either.\u00a0 So when you plug them in, they are always on.\u00a0 Tying the LED to the tank seemed wise as it would be a reminder that the unit was still plugged in.\u00a0 Now the LED I used is designed to handle 13.5 volts of DC power, or rather its resistor is rated for that.\u00a0 It is actually 2 LEDS, one red and one blue soldered to a teeny circuit board.\u00a0 I pried it out of wind-shield washer spray unit designed to light up the hood of a car.\u00a0 I`m all about recycling, so I used what I had.\u00a0 The coffee maker on the other hand is designed for 120v of AC power, so I couldn\u2019t just hook them together.\u00a0 Instead I took advantage of R2`s big hollow feet.\u00a0 I simply hid a small cell phone charger that converts 120v AC in and outputs 4v DC.\u00a0 Even though the resistor is rated for 13.5v the LEDs themselves only require 3.5v, with the other .5v going to resistor heaven.\u00a0 I simple tied the ac plug section of the small transformer into the power going to the coffee maker.\u00a0 When you plug in the coffee maker, the power splits to light the LED and turn on the coffee maker, unplug it and it the coffeemaker turns off as does the LED", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F7I/ZQE1/H1WHV8Q7/F7IZQE1H1WHV8Q7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3T/T7MY/H1WHV8RS/F3TT7MYH1WHV8RS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQA/XAG0/H1WHV8SA/FQAXAG0H1WHV8SA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8O/MHCE/H1KHAX81/F8OMHCEH1KHAX81.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU7/Q447/H1WHV8R3/FU7Q447H1WHV8R3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNJ/7HSU/H1JUJSGK/FNJ7HSUH1JUJSGK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 13: Wire It Up"}, {"step": 14, "steps_text": "Make some coffee all ready.&nbsp; Did I mention you can vary the pot size, I have a little pot thats cute but small.&nbsp; Then I have a large lab vessel, its great for lots of people.&nbsp; The benefit with a BUNN is add 1/2 a litre of water and get back 1/2 a liter of water.&nbsp; With the same machine you could add 2 litres and get back 2 litres of coffee, can do that with a regular drip<br /> <div class=\"media_embed\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/ldcD74O_K6U\" width=\"560\"></iframe></div> <br /> <div class=\"media_embed\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/eyAgvffRTGY\" width=\"560\"></iframe></div>", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 14: Take It for a Test Brew"}], "channel": "No channel to show"}, {"category": "No category to show", "description": "I know theres alot of diy LED light online already so here's another..although this one is cheaper and less complex than most.

So when the relay is tripped, the point gets pulled high, causing the light to flash. I set mine up to work by first having the strobe knob set to max. I then soldered the relay so that it connects the middle of the knob(where the voltage controls the flashing speed) to the ground. This causes it not to flash. When the relay is tripped the connection is broken, allowing it to flash. (see the pictures for more notes)Before you go using this configuration, know that it is dangerous to short the positive to the ground. My strobe has a resistor (to control the max flashing rate) between the positive and the control potentiometer(knob). This makes it so it doesn't short. If yours doesn't have one, it might be good to add it before trying this.It is also important to make sure the relay can handle the voltages you will be applying across it.

However, if you are going to attach the strobe light or other heavier object to the pumpkin, I suggest using wood screws.Once you have the sensor and gas threaded through the hole, use a couple more paper clips to anchor them to the pumpkin and aim them where they are needed. I suggest placing the gas opening 4 cm (about 2\") away from the flame. Place the light sensor just off to the side behind the gas opening.A potential pitfall is the gas may miss the flame if it is bumped or the flame height lowers, so aim accordingly. If the strobe light goes off for more then a second, this means the flame sensor missed when the gas went off, which stops the program. To fix it, just reset the arduino and adjust the sensor so it won't happen again. The continuous flash could also mean the pumpkin is low on gas, or isn't putting out enough gas, so fill it up or open the regulator if needed.When everything is adjusted properly the system works quite reliably, producing a nice effect when people walk up.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FHB/3KMY/FMZAIHEK/FHB3KMYFMZAIHEK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU7/GR1G/FMMCVJGL/FU7GR1GFMMCVJGL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHL/RYUQ/FMZAIHEJ/FHLRYUQFMZAIHEJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ5/FY28/FMZAIHEY/FZ5FY28FMZAIHEY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZD/2DOU/FMZAIHEE/FZD2DOUFMZAIHEE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8O/XG8E/FMZAIHED/F8OXG8EFMZAIHED.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Final Assembly"}], "channel": "No channel to show"}, {"category": "technology", "description": "In this Instructable I'll show you how to properly dissassemble your ( or somebody else's :P ) Xbox 360 PSU.\u00a0\nIf all you want to do is get rid of the dust in it, I would simply recommend blowing compressed air through the vent holes.\u00a0\nThere could be issues with heat due to little, or bad thermal paste, this will show you how to get to it.\nThe tools you'll need are a No.2 Phillips, and perhaps a No.1.\nSomething narrow with a sharp point, preferably strong enough to put a fair amount of force into.

Taking your best guess, write down the at-rest resistance of your cord, then round it to the nearest multiple of 10.

You can only stretch this stuff until it is about 50%-70% of its original length, so don\u2019t pull too hard!  Observe how the resistance values on your multimeter have changed. Let go, and repeat this process a few times to watch the resistance go from its minimum to its maximum. As you stretch it out, the resistance increases because the particles in the rubber are moved farther apart. Once the force is released, the rubber will shrink back, although it takes a minute or two to revert to its original length. Because of these physical limitations this stretchy cord is not a true linear sensor, so it isn\u2019t amazingly precise but there are ways to work with this in the construction of your sensor.

Depending on the values of the resistors you use, you can chop your 5V out from your Arduino into larger or smaller portions of itself with a pull-down resistor, which is useful for Analog Read.  If you would like to learn more about the math behind voltage dividing circuits, take a look at the excellent tutorial at Sparkfun.While we know that the value of the first resistor in the circuit (the stretch sensor) will be in constant flux, we need to use a proper resistance value for the pull-down resistor in order to get as nice and varied a signal as possible.  To start, use the Axel Benz formula:Pull-Down-Resistor = squareroot(Rmin * Rmax)So if the minimum value of your stretch cord is 130ohms, and the maximum is 240ohmsPull-Down Resistor = squareroot(130*240)Pull-Down Resistor = squareroot(31200)Pull-Down Resistor = 176.635217327So now you should be looking at your resistor collection and figuring out what your best-case resistor \u201cfor now\u201d is.

You will need a solid piece of aluminium circular section about 3-4\" long and about 2\" wide, you then need to turn it down to the shape in the picture below or very close to it. This is the restrictor that reduces the area of the inlet manifold raising the input pressure and thus air density allowing for greater compression ratios and the potential for more expansion in the combustion chamber.In retrospect this piece is far too heavy and a similar hollow alternative would have been far more effective performance wise.Once your restrictor has been fabricated you need to drill a hole down the centre the same diameter as the external diameter of the thick (10-15mm) copper tube.You then need to drill several holes around the pieces circumference just after its widest point. This is to improve air-fuel misture. These holes need to be as fine as possible to atomise the liquid fuel as it comes through the hole, Seriously the smaller the better. Mine were too big and i had fuel burning isues with liquid fuel.Drift the copper tube into the thinner end of the restrictor and secure in place with solder for added security. bend the tube over at a right angle (I realise mine is not a right angle but i didnt have a pipe bender and this was sastisfactory as it fullfilled all the major requirements).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZC/LU53/FN82WQ36/FZCLU53FN82WQ36.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9O/HY0F/FN82WQ35/F9OHY0FFN82WQ35.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7F/EEHL/FN82WQ34/F7FEEHLFN82WQ34.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2S/GKH3/FN82WQ33/F2SGKH3FN82WQ33.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6O/44RS/FN82WQ32/F6O44RSFN82WQ32.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0O/2RN7/FN82WQ31/F0O2RN7FN82WQ31.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRI/LCFK/FN82WQ30/FRILCFKFN82WQ30.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4T/EXGJ/FN82WQ2Z/F4TEXGJFN82WQ2Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F75/B9R6/FN82WQ2X/F75B9R6FN82WQ2X.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Make Your Fuel Injector"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Now you have the Fuel Injector built you need to mount it on the engine. This is the reason i used the 10-15mm copper tube. It is stiff enough to support the  heavy restrictor securely.Take a piece of the sheet metal from a can that has been cut open end wrap it around your ducted fan exhaust securing in place with a small piece of tape. Then put the other end into the entrance of your combustion cahmber as shown in a picture below. Adjust the sheet metal that is now wrapped into a tube until it is a tight fit in the combustion chamber entrance and allows for a little adjustment so you can change how far it protrudes into the combustion chamber by about an inch.Draw lines on your tube to show where the overlap is and how far the minimum and maximum protrusion is. Now you need to take the can off the ducted fan again and find a drill bit the same diameter as your 10-15mm copper tube. Mine was 12mm. Clamp a scrap piece of wood in the vice and drill a hole in your tube on the join. Cut off any excess on the inside of the tube leaving at least 15mm overlap and put a slit in one of your holes, the one closest to the edge so that you can slide the copper tube into it without threading it through.Reconstruct the engine attaching the sheet metal tube to the ducted fan in the position previously marked and test the fit of the fuel injector.The sheet metal tube is not sturdy enough to secure the fuel injector to the ducted fan with so i used a piece of aluminium box section I \"borrowed\" from my brother. You could use any sturdy square section material, wood may even suffice. Line up your fuel injector central in the entrance to the combustion chamber and then lie the copper tube ontop of your box section. then draw over it in the outline of the tubes path. Measure and mark the centre of the path and use a set square to translate that line onto its top face and bottom face respectively. Meaure the centre of the sections length and mark it on again using the set square. Since my tube is bent i did not have one hole all the way through the box section rather 2 seoeratly drilled holes so that it would slide through.Use a centre punch on your marks where to drill and drill your holes with a drill bit the same diameter as the copper tube so the tube is a tight push fit into the holes.Put the components together and secure them in place with the strongest adhesive available, either solder or areldite/epoxy resin is recomended.

Another inch can be had for free in the A-A-B-B stud. The height of the table can similarly be changed by making just the A pieces longer, and raising the position of the rear upper crossmember to match.Add a Clamping Edge The front of the tabletop is flush with the frame.

I have decided to do this project on this because I thought it would be interesting and fun to figure out. After hours of troubleshooting this circuit I finally finished it which was really rewarding seeing it working. My Temperature Controlled Fan circuit has a Liquid Crystal Displayconnected to the Arduino to display the temperature in Celsius and fan speed (50-255 PWM) this controls the duty cycle of the fan which then controls the fan speed. The temperature sensor output is read by the Arduino and the software establishes the desired fan speed for a given temperature reading. This is done at the PWM output pin 6 which varies the square wave duty cycle thereby increasing or decreasing the effective power to the fan thus changing the fan speed. This type of circuit is commonly used in HVAC systems to vary fan speeds as temperature changes as when there is a reduction of heating or cooling requirements during overnight hours. The fan is a 12V DC Brushless Motor. Another important component is the NPN Transistor in the circuit. The transistor will not allow the fan to turn on without enough current going into the base of the transistor from the PWM pin 6 of the Arduino in series with a 1K\u2126 Resistor to saturate the transistor which then allows the DC fan to energize.", "title": "Temperature Controlled Fan", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Temperature-Controlled-Fan-1/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The parts I used to do this\u00b7        Genuino UNO\u00b7        Temperature Sensor \u2013 key part\u00b7        1K\u2126 Resistor\u00b7        100\u00b5F/16V Capacitor\u00b7        PN2222A NPN Transistor \u2013 Key part to turn on the fan\u00b7        12V DC Brushless Fan \u2013 key part\u00b7        1N4007 Diode\u00b7        AC \u2013 DC Plug in Adapter 120VAC to 12VDC\u00b7        Liquid Crystal Display\u00b7        Extra Breadboard", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F6J/J3SZ/IWH3F32B/F6JJ3SZIWH3F32B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0R/ROG3/IWH3F30J/F0RROG3IWH3F30J.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Parts You Will Need"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F3V/KHAK/IWH3F17O/F3VKHAKIWH3F17O.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Schematic"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "#include \n // library for LCDLiquidCrystal lcd(12, 11, 5, 4, 3, 2);\nfloat temp; // set temp as a whole number\nint tempPin = A0; //arduino pin used for temperature sensor\nint tempMin = 23;  // the temperature to start the buzzer\nint tempMax = 26;   // temperature full speed\nint fan = 6;       // the pin where fan is connected\nint fanSpeed = 0; // fan speed variablevoid setup() {\n \n pinMode(fan, OUTPUT); // declaring fan pin 6 as output\n pinMode(tempPin, INPUT); // declaring tempPin A0 as input\n lcd.begin(16, 2); // LCD intialize  \n lcd.clear(); // clears lcd\n lcd.print(\"Fan Speed:\"); // prints \"Fan Speed\" 50-255 PWM\n lcd.setCursor(0,1); // Sets cursor for next line\n lcd.print(\"Temperature:\"); // Prints \"Temperature\" below \"Fan Speed\"\n Serial.begin(9600); // begins the serial monitor\n}void loop() {\n  temp = analogRead(tempPin);\n  float voltage = (temp/1024)*5.0;\n  float temperature = (voltage - 0.5) * 100; // formula for degrees celcius \n  Serial.println(temperature); // prints temp in serial monitor\n  lcd.setCursor(12,1); // 12 character to the right on the first column\n  lcd.print(temperature); // prints the number on the 12 character\n  delay(1000);        // delay in between reads for stability\n  if(temp < tempMin) {   // if temp is lower than minimum temp\n  fanSpeed = 0;      // fan is not spinning\n  digitalWrite(fan, LOW); // pin 6 output is low \n   } \n    \n     if((temperature >= tempMin) && (temperature <= tempMax))  //if temperature is higher than the minimmum range\n   { \n    fanSpeed = map(temperature, tempMin, tempMax, 50, 255); // the actual speed of fan\n    analogWrite(fan, fanSpeed);  // spin the fan at the fanSpeed speed  \n    Serial.println(fanSpeed); // prints fan speed in serial monitor\n    lcd.setCursor(12,0); // sets cursor\n    lcd.print(fanSpeed); // prints \n    lcd.print(\"  \"); // fixes an error of random number display\n   } \n   }", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 3: Source Code // Commented "}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "This project was a really enjoyable experience for me to learn.

I've been camping for nearly 50 years (tenting, trailer camping, and backpacking with my parents and car camping/backpacking with my wife and children) and I though one would be perfect for low impact car camping without having to set up and tear down a tent on a daily basis on a long trip.  The real impetus for this project was a desire to take my children on a vacation across the USA and to visit 18 - 20 national parks over a 40 day window (Photo 1).With the teardrop trailer you have a good solution - small enough to get through tight spaces (Photos 2,3,4,5,6) while large enough to provide some comfort and independence for more than a day or three.Before I began design and construction I sat down and thought about what features I wanted in the camper and how I was going to use it.As your typical geek - I needed to start with capturing the requirements:Trailer had to be large enough for a full-size fulton mattress to fit in (if I'm going to build it, I at least  want it to be comfortable to sleep in).            Didn't want it so small that we felt claustrophobic if we were trapped in it for the better part of a day due to bad weather (Photos 7,8 - California redwoods) .            Wanted decent airflow through the unit and insulation to provide some noise reduction from outside noises and to slow down temperature swings on the inside.            Wanted the camper part to be removable from the flatbed trailer so the trailer could be used for other things if necessary.            Wanted everything to run from 12 VDC, but also wanted a couple of 120 VAC outlets and a battery charger available if AC power was available.            Wanted LED lighting - low power consumption and they don't break as easily as regular lights when subjected to shock and vibration.              Wanted a functional kitchen/galley with a decent prep counter-top (we have tent camped for years and I really dislike doing food prep on picnic tables - they work but...) - (Photos 9,10,11,12)         Wanted sufficient space to store all the cooking gear, a cooler, 12 gallons of water, and storage for food (Photo 9)         Wanted a stove (reuse my trusty Coleman propane stove) (Photo 10)         Wanted a gas grill (Photo 11)          Needed a \"sink/washbasin area - but decided against a full up sink, drain, water pump implementation - it would take up a lot of space that can't be used for storage (Photo 11)         Wanted storage in the cabin area - his, hers', ours'            Camper needed to be sturdy enough to handle some fairly rough off-road bouncing around without getting damaged (Photos 2,3,4,5,6)         Wanted the top of the camper to be sufficiently strong to support a roof rack to haul kayaks or a rocket box if necessary.            Wanted an aluminum bodied trailer instead of a steel one.  Provides for corrosion resistance, strength, and light weight (Photo 13)         Wanted space in front of camper (2' to 3') to be able to carry 4 bicycles also (Photo 13).            Wanted doors that had good locks and windows that could open with screens to provide airflow (Photos 1,13,14)         Wanted a roof vent in the cabin area with a fan (12 VDC)            Seriously though about Solar Cells - decided against them at this time,          Seriously looked at deep cycle batteries but decided that two pickup truck batteries that were compatible with my truck would let me swap out batteries as necessary to recharge them while driving down the road using the truck alternator.          Wanted a space for a fire extinguisher.... Hey - I'm cooking with propane!            Was very concerned about structural integrity - shock and vibration does a lot of damage to things not designed to handle it.            Wanted it to be able to handle the weather - hot, cold, wet, and dry.  (Photos 7,8).I began by creating paper sketches for the camper in December, finalized the drawings by February and began building the camper in March.   Construction was finished in late May and we took it out over the Memorial Day weekend for a shake down trip. We returned from the Memorial Day trip and I made a series of tweaks to the camper over the next couple of weeks.  In the middle of June I packed up the kids, the wife, the kitchen sink and broke the trailer in properly - a 9991 mile trip around the USA visiting multiple national parks - some nights staying at commercial campgrounds while other nights were only lit by the trailer LED lights and the stars.", "title": "Teardrop Trailer - Boxes Within a Box", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Teardrop-Trailer-Boxes-Within-a-Box/", "section": "outside", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I began the project by looking at the photos of many teardrops published on the internet, at the many plans published in the 40's and 50's by Popular Mechanics, and finally by visiting a couple of travel trailer dealers that sell commercially made units.  The trailers the dealers had were nice but were generally spartan and lacked the custom features that a home-made trailer has. I was also very tempted to purchase one of the detailed construction plans that can be purchased by multiple vendors on the internet that walk you through each step to make the trailer - but in the end I decided to design and build my own.I started out by creating a number of hand drawings of potential shapes and sizes and modified them as I began to resolve my requirements.  I measured the cooler I wanted to haul in the back and measured the futon mattress  that would go in the cabin to get the minimum interior dimensions.  I had a difficult time deciding on the trailer bed size -  7' x 14' or a 6' x 12' bed.  The more I thought about it and laid things out on paper as well as adding the total trailer length and the length of the truck I was going to tow with, the more I realized the 7' x 14' trailer would be too large for some of the places I wanted to go and the 6'x12' trailer was the more cost effective and versatile solution (for instance Zion NP has trailer size limitations).  To get an idea of the final physical size, I cut some 1\" wide x 1/8\" thick x 96\" strips of from pine wood and used the wood strips and duct tape to create a physical  outline of the desired frame (width, length, height) on my patio and used this outline to firm up the design.In the end, camper was 71-1/2\" wide, 108\" long, and 60\" high.   The major drawback of selecting this size of a camper from a construction perspective - sheets of plywood are 48\" x 96\" so I couldn't just use a single sheet of plywood anywhere - this drove the cost up a little and also added to complexity of the build. I tried to scan the drawings I made for the cabin but the contrast was really bad - green engineering paper and mechanical pencil doesn't hold up well over a few months of using them for reference.If you haven't already done it check out the teardrop trailers by e1ioan or HaleyP5 - they are great! There are several custom things they did that I would have loved to incorporate into my design - if I would have thought about it. That is half the fun of building your own teardrop - you can customize it to your own needs or desires.Once I knew the design, I could begin purchasing the necessary materials...  but first some thoughts on the construction of the camper.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWV/UX33/IM7YP43G/FWVUX33IM7YP43G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUG/1EB0/ILV8M5M0/FUG1EB0ILV8M5M0.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Creating the Design"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "In this section I thought I'd provide some commentary on the construction - skip this section if you are just interested in looking at the construction steps.This isn't a project for the faint of heart - you will build a box with complex curves, insulation, electricity, and it must survive vibrations and the elements.  It requires the use of a fairly decent woodshop and all the tools necessary for general construction.    I tried to create this Instructables with a logical reading flow for the construction process - section by section, step by step.    To actually construct this teardrop trailer, there is a lot moving between the sections during the construction.    The internet is great for finding the materials you need - before heading to the local hardware stores (Home Depot, LOWES, Tractor Supply) I would always check their inventory on hand so I didn't waste a trip.    For all the things the local hardware stores didn't stock or were easier to get via direct shipment I used the following companies extensively (in alphabetical order): Amazon.com, HarborFreight.com, McFeeley.com, Rockler.com, Teardroptrailerparts.com, Zoro.com,    I estimate the weight of the camper to be less than 400 lbs. empty - I can lift the front about 6\" by hand to get supports under it.  The back is heavier and I need a short lever to get it off the concrete pad.    Everything was glued and screwed or I used an air nailer when appropriate.  Nothing was ever glued without secondary fastening and all secondary fastening had glue applied.  Also, everything that was screwed together was pre-drilled with an appropriate pilot drill bit and countersunk before glue was applied.    Screws: Used a variety of #6,#8, #10 screws - round head & flat head.  Also a selection of stainless steel screws for exterior work.  I purchased the screws used for construction from   http://www.mcfeelys.com and purchased an assortment of Kreg cabinetry screws from  www.rocker.com.    Glue: Exterior wood glue for everything - I used Titebond and Gorilla    I really like the look of wood, especially wood with character, so the interior of the camper would be sealed - no stain or paint on the interior. I wanted the cabinetry in the kitchen/galley area and in the sleeping area to look nice, so I decided to make the frames and doors out of cherry - fortunately I had a couple hundred board feet of rough cut cherry in the lumber pile.    For the exterior, I wanted an exterior color that looked nice, would hide all the little mistakes I knew I would make, and didn't clash with the color of my truck.  Really thought hard about the aluminum exterior that so many teardrop have, but having never worked with big sheets of aluminum was afraid of screwing it up.  I also considered fiberglassing the exterior - but didn't want to have to deal with the odor in my garage.    I chose to use a marine grade epoxy as the sealer and then coated the camper with two coats of an exterior grade metallic paint.  The marine grade epoxy and metallic paint worked wonderfully - except at the joints where the sheets of plywood came together.  All the shaking and vibration from the trip across the USA created microscopic hairline cracks and by the time we were headed home from the trip I was spreading caulk across a number of fine cracks (OSI QUAD is a fabulous product).  In the end though, water got in a seam and the 1/4\" plywood I used for the exterior wall acted like a sponge.    Since then I've removed the damaged panels, remounted them (screw & glue), and coated the trailer with fiberglass and resin.Cost to build the camper:Flatbed trailer - 6' x 12' - $2500 - much higher than purchasing a trailer from Harbor Freight or a standard steel trailer but I wanted aluminum so it wouldn't rust, be lighter than an equivalent steel trailer, and would be strong enough to handle some serious off-road use - with and without the camper.    Cabin doors - I purchased pre-made doors from: http://teardroptrailerparts.com They were responsive and the received product was of excellent quality.  They ran about $300 each.    All the rest (see the parts list on the next page) ran somewhere between $1000 and $1500.    Not real inexpensive but less than the $8k to $10K for a commercially made unit with some customization.The most difficult parts of the entire construction process were:the installation if the interior cabin roof - overhead, tight space, tight curves, and the walls were about 1/8\" out of true with each other.        creation of the back hatch for the kitchen.  Maintaining the curvature of the hatch while ensuring the squareness of the hatch during fabrication and glue-up and installing the hatch latches were all challenges.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FP5/2E02/IMI0W32T/FP52E02IMI0W32T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRL/HT27/IMI0W3ZN/FRLHT27IMI0W3ZN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKC/K9HJ/IMI0W46L/FKCK9HJIMI0W46L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F10/5300/IMI0W4WG/F105300IMI0W4WG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBW/E78U/IMI0W5FZ/FBWE78UIMI0W5FZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSC/LLUN/IMI0W5I8/FSCLLUNIMI0W5I8.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Thoughts on Construction "}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "I can't find the original parts list I created and there were several unplanned trips to the hardware store for additional materials but this is a fairly complete parts list.

Using heavy duty casters didn't enter into the equation because I didn't want the camper sliding around on the trailer.  I was somewhat conflicted regarding how to mount the camper to the trailer - seriously considered drilling holes through the floor of the cabin and the bed of the trailer and using bolts or U-bolts to anchor everything together.  In the end I decided not to ruin the integrity of the trailer frame by doing this.  Instead, I used two - 3000#  2\" wide racketing tie-down straps - the same ones used by trucking companies to tie loads down on their trailers - the drawing shows the frame overlaid on the trailer bed with the trailer tie-down locations and a yellow strip to represent where the tie-down straps fit.I started the project by constructing the cross frame (I have no photos of this so the first drawing will have to do).  I started with rough cut Oak lumber - 5/4\" thick and 10 - 12 feet long.  These were cut to 108\" long boards, ripped to 2\" wide, jointed and planed to 1\" thick.  I made 8 of these boards and glued  & clamped them into 4 pairs using gorilla glue.  These were the bottom skid plates for the camper.    Still using oak, I made 12 - 3/4\" x 2\" 69-1/2\" long slats.  Nine of these were placed on top of the skid plates, clamped in place, adjusted the squareness of the assembly, pre-drilled and countersunk.  I used a 2\" - #10 flat head screw every time a slat crossed the skid plates.  Once all the pilot holes were in place, I took the entire assembly apart, coated the mounting points with gorilla glue and screwed the slats down tightly onto the skid plates.    When this was all dry, I took the 3 reserved oak boards from the last step and cut them into blocks which I inserted between each strut (see the second figure - measure, cut, dry fit, glue, nail) on the exterior skid plates so the floor and walls would have a continuous and solid foundation to be mounted to.  Did not block the slots for the nylon strap.    Make certain the entire foundation is flat and square - I was off by less than 1/16\" of an inch off square and it caused headaches during the rest of the construction process.    The next step was to mount a layer of 1/2\" plywood on the foundation frame.  I cheated a little here - laid the plywood on the garage floor and flipped the foundation frame over the plywood and marked the cuts and where the foundation slats crossed the plywood.  The frame was then removed, the plywood was placed on some 2\"x4\" lumber and pilot holes were drilled and the plywood was cut to fit the frame.  The frame was then placed in the floor, plywood was flipped over and placed on top of the frame and a countersink was used for each of the screw holes.  The plywood was raised, all the slats were coated with gorilla glue, and the plywood was placed back on the frame and screwed in place.    This frame was left overnight to dry.    The next day, another layer of 1/2\" plywood was glued and air nailed (3/4\" brads) on top of the first layer making certain the 2nd layer of plywood covered all the butt joints from the first layer of plywood 90 degrees off - the idea was to have a 1\" thick floor of plywood that didn't have any long butt joints that were not covered.    The floor was then flipped over and a bead of OSI calk was placed wherever the plywood and a slat met.    The entire floor was then coated twice with external wood sealer used for decks in wet climates (I don't remember the brand) and let dry for a couple of days.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FGN/XY1J/IM6LCFAD/FGNXY1JIM6LCFAD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNP/MB06/IM80RO5N/FNPMB06IM80RO5N.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Building the Foundation Frame"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Building the sidewalls was a difficult step.  I initially needed to create pattern matched interior and exterior walls (see first drawing) with the exterior walls being extending 1\" lower than the interior walls (See image).To accomplish this step required me to measure, draw, measure, draw, measure, check, measure, check - I needed to ensure the doors were located so they would't hit the tire fenders, they were high enough so I could have some framing entirely around them, and so the walls aligned up perfectly with the floor frame and the slots where the restraining straps would go.        Additionally since the size of the camper body (big curved box) was larger than a single sheet of plywood and I didn't want plywood butt seams to overlap on the interior and exterior this meant I needed to overlap the sheets of plywood so the interior had the 8' side of the plywood going vertical and the exterior sides were laid out horizontal.  Initially I assumed there would be a lot of wasted plywood with this approach, but ended up using the extra wood later in the project.        I started building the sides by laying out 12 sheets of 1/4\" plywood side by side with a 4'x8' side against the 8'x4' side.   I laid the plywood out with the two interior finished faces of the sheets facing each other - I wanted the interior wood grain to be as nice as possible.        I then sketched out the desired shape of the camper on the plywood, correcting the profile curves several times until I got the final profile I wanted.   Although I had already done the stick mock-up on the patio, I wasn't totally pleased with the mock-up curves and wanted some curves that were more difficult to create than I could do with the mock-up.      Once I got the profile I wanted outlined in pencil, I re-drew it with a Sharpie marker (there were a number of pencil curves in some areas and I didn't want to cut the wrong curve), I then laid a cabin door on the plywood and outlined the cutout profile as well as outlined the cutout profile for the back hatch (didn't cut the hatch out until much later in the project).   The doors were difficult so get properly positions and I had to adjust them several times until I got them where I wanted them.        Once I was happy with the layout - ensuring the doors wouldn't hit the tire wells or anything else when opened, I grabbed several wood clamps and clamped all the plywood sheets together.  I then strategically screwed all the sheets together so they wouldn't move while I was cutting them out.        I slid multiple 2\"x4\"x8' boards under the walls and began cutting using a saber-saw, staying just outside the marked line (most of the time).  Once the outside curves were cut and the scrap wood moved out of the way, I drilled four (4) 1\" holes with a spade bit on the 4 corners of the door outline.  Make sure there is a support board under each of the 4 points so the spade bit doesn't tear the final layer of plywood when it pokes through that layer.  With the 4 holes drilled, I cut the door openings out.        When I was completely done with cutting the sidewalls I removed the screws I had used to hold the plywood sheets together and began to take the walls apart - labeling the pieces as I took them apart - Interior wall 1,2,3,4,5,6, Exterior wall 1,2,3,4,5,6.  I did the labelling on the sides that would not be exposed to the interior or exterior of the cabin.        The next step was to frame the walls.  Many teardrop trailer plans only use 1 or 2 sheets of 3/4\" or 1\" plywood to provide thickness for the walls - I wanted insulation, structural strength, reduced weight, and the ability to run wiring through the walls of the camper - so I framed it out.        The framing consisted if 1\"x4\" pine boards that were glued and screwed or brad nailed to the walls.  I framed out the openings for the doors and where the bulkhead between the interior cabin and the kitchen would be as well as where the countertop and interior cabinet would be located. The exterior curves were also framed out with 1\"x4\" boards - each board was cut with a miter saw to butt together and frame the outer edge of the walls.        Once the 1\"x4\" boards have been mounted and dried, use your saber saw to trim any wood that isn't flush with the inner wall.     Clamp the two interior walls together and sand the edges to make them as close to mirror images as possible - this is the last chance to get two perfect walls.     The next step was to determine the location for all the lighting, switches, and wiring necessary to be run before installing the insulation and closing the walls up.   Since all the wiring in the walls was 12 VDC, that meant running a + wire (Red) and - (Black) wire for each light, light switch, and the fan.   I had 2 overhead LED spotlights, ceiling fan, two reading lights (one on each side of the cabin), and LED light strips - in the interior of the cabin and 2 exterior lights - one by each door.  The one exterior light and the one LED spotlight were wired to switches next to each door.  The ceiling fan had it's own switch so I just needed sufficient wire for a home run (1 red and 1 black wire run continuously to the circuit panel).  The reading lights had integrated switches so they required home runs also.  Finally I had the LED strip lights - one strip on each side of the cabin running along the ceiling - these were controlled by a switch on the interior cabinet.     The key thing here is to determine where you want to mount your lights, fans, and switches and run the wires at this stage.  Running the wires requires drilling through the 1\" x 4\" boards pulling pairs or multiple pairs of wires through the holes.  It's better to pull an extra 5 feet of wire (and leave it hanging) at this stage and cut it back later than to only pull 3 feet and come up short when it comes time connect everything up.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F60/44X0/IM80REOH/F6044X0IM80REOH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIL/FE18/IM80RLEW/FILFE18IM80RLEW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQG/GRFZ/I81GDO32/FQGGRFZI81GDO32.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Building the Side-Walls"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "At this stage we've got a cabin base and two interior walls that are hopefully exact mirror copies of each other.The next step is to mount the interior walls to the floor.  To do this. I used an extension bit and drilled 1/2\" holes about half way through the bottom  of the frame (Drawing above - bottom image).  I drilled 9 holes on each wall and then used long 3/8\" brad point bits to finish drilling through the frame.  Next I ran a strip of glue along the bottom of one wall and mounted it along the edge of the base frame using 3\" #10 screws to hold the wall in place.  Repeat the process for the second wall.  I then took some of the firing lath and carefully measured the distances between each wall as mounted on the floor and used the firing lath and screws to temporarily hold the walls as parallel to each other as possible while the glue dried.        The interior walls are now mounted and you have the wires pulled through the walls.  It time to install the insulation - I used 3/4\" - 4'x8' sheets of insulation. Measure the space in the wall between the 1\" x 4\" boards, cut the insulation to size. I usually cut a fraction larger than measured so the insulation would be a tight fit. I had to cut grooves in the insulation where the wire was in the walls.         Mark where the wires are as you install the insulation - both on the insulation and on the 1\"x4\" boards. This is very important to do so that you don't drive a screw or nail through your wiring later on. As soon as you get the insulation installed.       Each wall has been framed with 1x4 lumber, has some wiring for future lighting pulled through it, has been insulated, and has been through a sanding process to ensure the edges of the walls are as similar as possible.        Next dry fit the exterior walls and marked them to show where the wiring is so you won't nails or screws in those areas.  Additionally, the exterior walls were marked to show where the bulkhead between the cabin and the kitchen goes and where the shelf over the head board was to be mounted.  The exterior walls mounting holes were marked, then drilled and countersunk.  Once an exterior wall piece was ready, glue was liberally applied to the framing and the exterior wall panels were screwed in place.        The next step was to mount the bulkhead between the galley and the cabin - this consisted of 3 main pieces of 1/2\" plywood - two mounted vertically and one horizontally.        The bottom piece height was set so I could fully slide a cooler beneath it and still leave room for a 2\" shelf above the cooler - nominally 28\" in my case.  Once the bottom piece was cut to size (approximately 69 3/4\" x 28\") it was dry fit and the location was marked on the floor and interior walls.  I used a level to make sure the piece was perpendicular to the cabin floor.  Remove the bottom piece and drill mounting holes through the walls from the inside of the cabin, put the bottom piece back in and drill 1/8\" pilot holes into the plywood from the exterior.  This is followed by running a line of glue around the sides and bottom of the plywood and use 3\" #8 flat head screws - countersink the exterior walls before using them.  For the bottom I used 1\" brad nails and secured the bottom of the plywood bulkhead to the cabin floor.        The horizontal part of the bulkhead is installed next.  Make sure to use a measure at all 4 corners of the plywood to ensure this piece is parallel to the cabin floor.dry fit, mark, remove, drill from the inside, re-install, drill from the outside, countersink in the outside, glue the top edge of the bottom bulkhead and the edges of the horizontal plywood, install it screw it together.  This it the foundation for the galley tabletop and the bottom of the interior cabinets.  This piece of plywood will get a 3/4\" wide piece of cherry trim later, so make sure it is at least 3/4\" to 1\" shy of the back edge of the galley - there will be a galley door that needs to close!        The next piece is the final vertical bulkhead.  I cut the width of the plywood to 69 3/4\"\" and then dry fit it on the horizontal bulkhead moving it forward and back until I got it where I wanted it - it needed to be located so there was 2 1/8\" to 2 1/4\" of clearance - once if positioned it and marked it for cutting to vertical size I cut and re-fit it.  Follow the same process as above - use a level to get it vertical on each wall, mark, drill, etc...        Adding the bulkheads really stabilized the side-walls.  Next I added a couple vertical partitions in the galley to make three sections.        One section to be used for sliding shelves for the propane grill and propane stove, one section for a cutlery drawer, cooler, two -12 VDC batteries, and a plastic container for the pots, pans, misc cooking utensils.  The final section was for 2 - 6 gallon containers of water, a drawer with a hole cut in it for a plastic bin to use as a sink, and to store a couple hydraulic jacks to stabilize the trailer at night (last photo).Next was the installation of the firing lath struts between the two walls.  The firing lath must be straight with no knots.  Each one was cut individually - the walls have a tendency to warp a little and by measuring the exterior at each point a strut was to be installed I was able to pull or push the walls in/out by 1/8\" to 1/16\" of an inch.  Each strut was dry fit, predrilled, glue applied, then screwed into place with a single 2 1/2\" #8 flat head screw.        At the top of the cabin this process changed a little - I wanted a 12 VDC powered roof vent to be installed.   To do this, I used 1\"x4\" pine lumber to build a mounting hole for the roof vent.  I cut 4 - ~69 3/4\" x 1\" x 4\" pine boards - mounting two flush with the top edge of the trailer walls separated by about 12 1/2\" (you will have to adjust for the vent you purchase.  I then mounted firing lath struts against the outer edges of the 1\" x 4\" - glued and nailed with 2\" nails.  Four 1\" x 4\" x 12 1/2\" boards were cut and dry fit perpendicular to the long boards.  I used the Kreg jig to drill 2 holes in each end of the short boards, glued and screwed them to the long boards.        The thickness of the 1\" boards is closer to 3/4\" and the firing lath struts are nominally 2\" wide, so sandwiching 2 - 1\" by 4\" boards together still leaves a slight gap on the underside.  To compensate for this, I cut some strips of 1/4\" plywood and used them in between the 1\"x4\" to gain the thickness needed.        NOTE:  it's really important to run the ceiling fan wiring from the sidewall to the location where the ceiling fan will be wired at this time.  If you forget to do it, it'll be really difficult to hide later on.        Complete the installation of the struts - about every 6\" - 12\".  Stop mounting firing lath struts about 12\" from where the back hatch is to be installed - the pine firing lath isn't strong enough (IMO) to handle the mounting of the back hatch hing - I was worried about the mounting screws stripping out so I made 2 pair of 3/4\" x 2\" by ~69 3/4\" oak boards and glued them together.  Once dry, they were mounted as the final two roof struts - glued and screwed to the sidewalls.  I used two 3\" - #10 flat head screws here.        Before completing this stage of the project, I installed 6 - eye bolts along the roof line.  The idea was to have mounting points for tarps when stuck camping with heavy rain or to provide for tie down points for a roof rack for a kayak in the future.  The eyebolts were 4\" to 6\" long - I don't remember what the hardware store had in stock at the time  I used 3/8\" galvanized eyebolts - first I threaded a nut the entire length of the eyebolt, added a washer, and inserted into pre-drilled holes in the wall.  Then I installed another washer followed by two more nuts.  Before I tightened the nuts down, I pulled the eyebolt out about 1 inch and liberally coated it with OSI caulk and pushed it back in and tightened everything down.  The eyebolts came in really handy to a tie tarp to during the trip.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8Q/875R/IMI0W9K4/F8Q875RIMI0W9K4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU4/XWU0/I81GDN4K/FU4XWU0I81GDN4K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQS/ZCQ9/I81GDO6P/FQSZCQ9I81GDO6P.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9K/EB84/I81GDO54/F9KEB84I81GDO54.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMR/QMRI/I81GDO2N/FMRQMRII81GDO2N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5K/A1G3/I81GDN9N/F5KA1G3I81GDN9N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVG/KWVN/IM7YP5IN/FVGKWVNIM7YP5IN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDU/4PYY/I81GDO7F/FDU4PYYI81GDO7F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3V/QAU8/I81GDO7E/F3VQAU8I81GDO7E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJW/3W1N/IM7YP7D2/FJW3W1NIM7YP7D2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9L/8DIK/IM7YPK4O/F9L8DIKIM7YPK4O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSK/95W4/I81GDNFR/FSK95W4I81GDNFR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1V/RGC0/IM7YPMX2/F1VRGC0IM7YPMX2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBZ/PPO4/IMTGDXGW/FBZPPO4IMTGDXGW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Mounting the Sides and Roof Struts"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "Mounting the interior cabin ceiling was the most difficult part of the entire project.  I picked up some Italian made 1/8\" plywood ( 4'x8' sheet) that was made to flex along the length instead of the width of the plywood.  I started by carefully measuring the interior of the cabin width between each wall.  The walls were pretty parallel but there was variance (within 1/8\") side to side along the top of the ridge line.  The interior width was a nominal 69 1/2\" and required nearly 11 feet of plywood - three sheets side by side.  The 1/8\" plywood is very thin and trim nails just punch right through it - so I needed a way to hold the plywood against the frame struts.  Before beginning the installation, I cut about 30 pieces of 1/4\" - 1\" x 12\" pieces of plywood and used them as nailing blocks to hold the plywood against struts while the glue was drying.        The first piece installation was easy - it went from the front cabin floor up 4 feet.  The curves for this piece were pretty simple and it was easy to install.  I cut the piece, dry fitted it and verified it fit properly - had to add in two extra struts for the bottom and top of the plywood to be attached to.  I fired up the air compressor and loaded the finish nailer with 1\" nails, spread glue on all the struts, pushed the plywood against the struts and used the nailing blocks to hold the plywood tight against the struts until the glue dried.        The second piece was the problem child for the installation - this was a very tight inside curve, it was overhead, and keeping it in place was difficult.  Following the pattern from the last piece, measure and dry fit - everything seemed to be ok...  the problems started when we tried to hold it in place and nail it against the struts.  I had both kids inside the cabin with me, holding the wood in place as I glued and nailed it tight.  The inside curve was too tight and I cracked the plywood about 6 inches up from the seam, after I'd nailed a lot of the plywood into place.  Fortunately I still had access to the exterior and was able to layer a couple layers of the 1/8\" plywood on the backside and glue/nail everything together to fix the crack.        The 3rd piece went in pretty easily and I was almost done with the interior ceiling.   The final step was to carefully cut out the hole for the vent.  To do this, I used a Dremel tool with a fine saw blade and cut from the exterior.  This actually worked pretty well.       During this stage I also made a shelf - 3/4\" x 10\" x 70\" that was mounted in the front of the cabin.  This was placed so it would be convenient to reach up to while laying in bed and put water bottles, reading glasses, books, etc. up for the night.  The shelf was trimmed to 69 3/4\" to fit in the cabin.      The location for the shelf was noted on the exterior cabin walls when they were glued and screwed on, so it was easy to mark, drill, and countersink the holes through the outer wall (See the drawing for a reference regarding the shelf location).    The shelf was held in place while the apprentice used an ice pick to mark where the pilot holes in the shelf were to be drilled.    Once the shelf pilot holes were drilled we used 3\" #10 screws to mount the shelf - I didn't use glue here because the fit was tight and I didn't want to get any glue on the cabin walls.  The mounted shelf can be seen in the first photo above.    The final step was to paint the interior ceiling flat white, starting at the shelf at the front of the cabin to the back of the cabin - I taped and covered all the shelving and the walls to prevent drips from ruining any of the interior finish.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F3K/C80T/I81GDODM/F3KC80TI81GDODM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF0/K671/I81GDODN/FF0K671I81GDODN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSP/NUWH/I81GDO7T/FSPNUWHI81GDO7T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1V/PEM1/I81GDO87/F1VPEM1I81GDO87.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOF/JUVA/I81GDNE5/FOFJUVAI81GDNE5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ5/B3HZ/IMI0V113/FQ5B3HZIMI0V113.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Interior Ceiling"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "The next stage was to insulate the exterior bulkhead.  I used nearly 3 - 4' x 8' sheets of 3/4\" foam insulation and a couple cans of spray foam insulation to hold everything in place.  Once the spray foam dried, I used a fine hand saw to cut the foam flush where it had expanded higher than the exterior struts.         Mounting the exterior plywood was much easier than the interior - spread some glue on each strut, bend the plywood around the curves, use a nail gun with 1\" brads and strips of plywood to hold everything in place until it dried.         The one problem was the seam between the sheets of the plywood - as can be seen in the second and third photos.  Sealing the seams was really difficult - body putty and marine grade epoxy and finally a 1\" strip of plastic with OSI caulk along the entire seam - the finished result is shown in the last photo.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F87/1A0O/IM7YNHFJ/F871A0OIM7YNHFJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F73/SS2Y/IM7YNHUH/F73SS2YIM7YNHUH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8R/570Y/IMI0WFP9/F8R570YIMI0WFP9.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Insulation & Exterior Bulkhead"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "The wiring for the camper was not as complex as I had originally anticipated - it was just tedious to pull all the 12VDC wires and make sure they were properly in place before I finished working on something that would prevent me from getting access to the wiring in the future.      The camper was to be self-contained using two 12 VDC light truck batteries for all electrical needs (photos 15, 16).  I had considered deep cycle marine batteries - but the weight and expense just didn't justify the purchase for the amount of expected use.        I also considered installing an inverter (I have a 1200W unit from another project) but decided that it really wasn't going to be necessary and that running 120VAC devices via the inverter wasn't an avenue I really wanted to go down.        I created a wiring closet in the interior of the the cabin between the two storage cabinets and a removable drawer (see photo #1).  Photo #2 shows the cover to the \"wiring closet\" with the drawer removed.         I located it under the big center drawer so I could remove the drawer and have sufficient work space where the wiring was contained.Starting with the AC power: I added the ability to connect to campground 120VAC power - if it was available then we would use it.     The 120VAC was wired to two GFCI outlets and to a battery charger - with the battery charger connected to an outlet that was in series with one of the GFCI outlets.   The GFCI outlets are being used as the circuit breakers for the camper, in addition to the circuit breakers that are provided by the campgrounds as part of the AC outlets at the sites.   I used 12 gauge multi-strand wire for all AC connections.          Wiring was pretty simple - see photos 6,7,8,9,10.          120VAC comes into the cabin through a weatherproof side side port (three photos of the apprentice engineer above).          The Ground (Green) goes directly to a wiring block that is common for all the 120VAC outlets.          The initial run (neutral - white, and hot - black) runs to a 120VAC GFCI outlet in the interior cabin.        This GFCI outlet then runs to a standard 120VAC outlet for the battery charger        The standard 120VAC outlet is then connected to the galley 120VAC GFCI outlet.  Photo 9 (I know the second GFCI isn't necessary).        The battery charger is connected to the interior outlet and feeds the batteries located in the galley area on the other side if the cabin bulkhead.The entire 12 VDC circuitry was physically separate from the 120 VAC with every 12 VDC circuit being fused separately - I used 18 gauge wire for this.  See photos 6,7,8,9,10.  The concept of operation for using two batteries is as follows:\u00b7     Battery 1 is connected to the battery charger and when AC power is available the battery is being charged. \u00b7      All lights and the ceiling fan are powered by Battery 2 during this time.  \u00b7      When the charge of Battery 2 starts dropping (very noticeable when the fan slows down), we swap the connections on the batteries and Battery 2 is charged while Battery 1 provides the 12VDC source.  \u00b7      When no AC power is available, I could swap a partially drained battery with the main truck battery and charge it during the day while we were driving around and swap it back out that evening - that way both batteries are used, but at no time is either battery completely drained.  \u00b7      We were able to get nearly 8 days of use out of the combined battery setup without needing to recharge a battery - this included lighting for 3-4 hours every evening and running the ceiling fan for at least 8 hours a night.The following circuits were run:        Exterior Door Lights         Interior reading lights        Ceiling fan / vent         Interior flood lights         Interior LED strip lights         Galley Hatch LED strip light         Galley Hatch LED flood lights         Interior 12VDC socket         Exterior 12VDC socket This doesn't seem like a lot of wiring but remember that each circuit requires a hot (+) and ground (-) wire and that switches need a run from the source then to the appliance (light, outlet, fan).  Additionally, just to make things a little more complicated, all the switches that I used had LED lights on them to find them easier in the dark.  I could tap off the (+) going to the switch for the appliance to light the switch LEDs, but still had to run a ground wire back to the control panel.        When running the wiring through the walls, it's important to mark where the wires are being run so that you don't accidentally put a finishing nail or screw through the wire at a later time.  Because I wanted a wood grain interior for the camper I used light pencil marks on the interior (could sand them out later).  For the exterior - I used black permanent markers to mark the no-go zones.        Mounting the batteries - didn't want the batteries bouncing around by themselves in the back of the camper so I used 3 - 1\" wide ratcheting tie downs.  One tie down for each battery to hold it to the floor of the trailer and then one tie down to hold both batteries to the bulkhead that separated the living area from the galley area.        My lighting selection was based on what I could order over the internet - I purchased 16 feet of exterior LED strip lighting (12 VDC) that I was able to cut to size and solder the + and - connections to.  The strip lights came with self-adhesive backing and worked out really well for installation.  I ran a strip along both sides of the interior cabin and connected both strips to a single switch.  I also ran a single strip over the cabinets in the cabin to provide lighting in the storage area.  This was an add on later when I realized I wanted more lighting in the cabin. I cut some 3/4\" by 3/4\" strips of cherry and then removed a 1/2\" square out of the wood to leave me some L shaped moulding that I could hide the wiring behind.        Exterior door lights were mounted next to the door and connected to interior switches on both sides of the cabin, just inside the door frame.        A pair of reading lights (also LED) were mounted on each side of the cabin wall about 30\" above the floor.  Each light had an individual switch on the light so all I had to run were + and - to each light.        In the wiring panel - hidden behind a panel in the middle of the cabinets in the cabin, I connected the + 12 VDC from the batteries to a 12 outlet fuse block to give me 12 circuits - more than I thought I would need. For the positive wires I used crimp-on quick connects to the fuse block.        The ground (-) wires were connected to the bottom of the fuse panel (see photo 8).  Spade lugs were crimped onto each ground wire end.Photos 12, 13, 14 show hidden wiring using trim, interior cabin light switches mounted by the door - one switch goes to the interior roof flood light and the second to the exterior door light and the exterior door light.The final photo is everything all wired up and closed up.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F9A/4O78/IM7YQWNX/F9A4O78IM7YQWNX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV7/WMRY/I81UYSWQ/FV7WMRYI81UYSWQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGF/SW4T/IMI0UKDS/FGFSW4TIMI0UKDS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7Y/3EL8/IM7YQUUJ/F7Y3EL8IM7YQUUJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH0/72ZI/IM7YQWHJ/FH072ZIIM7YQWHJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F95/U864/IM7YQWUQ/F95U864IM7YQWUQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIP/XD1G/IM7YQXIG/FIPXD1GIM7YQXIG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXI/LB08/IM7YQYV7/FXILB08IM7YQYV7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOU/6XUO/I81UYSXY/FOU6XUOI81UYSXY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM9/0INX/I81GDNNA/FM90INXI81GDNNA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXB/895S/I81GDODI/FXB895SI81GDODI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW6/85IX/I81UYSY3/FW685IXI81UYSY3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUF/FEEH/I81UYSX4/FUFFEEHI81UYSX4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8C/RLO8/IM6LEP13/F8CRLO8IM6LEP13.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWT/MNND/IMDZG8XB/FWTMNNDIMDZG8XB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLV/14PQ/IMDZK339/FLV14PQIMDZK339.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1C/0D7I/I81GDONC/F1C0D7II81GDONC.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Wiring"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "The roof vent was dry fit during the installation of the roof slats.  All that is left is wiring and water proof installation for the roof vent.  The wiring was a little difficult - you are bent over and reaching over your head to solder the fan wires to the wires you pulled earlier when you were building the walls and installing the roof slats           Once the soldering is complete, I used a couple wire nuts and some electrical tape to insulate the connection.             When the wiring is complete (and tested) then carefully outline the roof vent on the exterior roof with a marker.           Partially remove the roof vent and use the the putty tape to lay a strip down within the markings of the vent outline.          I overlapped the edges by about 1/8\" on each corner so that when the ovent was tightened down the putty would squeeze out and make a good seal around the vent.           Re-place the partially removed the roof vent and install the mounting screws - I tightened all the screws down until they just touched the plastic rim of the vent.           Once all the screws were installed, I then tightened each screw 1 turn at a time, working my way around the vent multiple times until the putty tape was slowly squeezing out and the vent was securely mounted.

The first part is the creation of the cabinets (galley and interior), installation of the galley countertop, and galley trim installation.        The second part is the fabrication of the cabinet doors for the galley and the interior cabin as well as the construction of the drawers.Starting with the galley cabinets, countertop, and trim.  All the cabinetry and trim started as rough cut 4/4 or 5/4 cherry lumber that was ripped, jointed, and planed to 3/4\" thickness, 1 1/4\" width, and cut to length.The first photo shows the almost finished product with the doors, countertop, and trim installed.           Cabinets were started by creating the face frames first - these had to align at the top with the oak strut that was installed to support the back hatch.  The top and bottom of the face frame were cut to 69 3/4\" long and 10 stiles were cut to 24\" long.           Kreg pocket screws were used to connect the horizontal and vertical face frames.           The face frame was then connected to the cabin walls and the galley countertop - measure, measure, and measure for this installation.  The face needs to be perfectly flat for the doors to fit properly and parallel to the cabin bulkhead behind it.           Once the face frame was installed two pieces of 1/2\" plywood were cut to fit behind the two center stiles (see photo 3).  Once the plywood was dry fit - 4 pieces of 1/4\" cherry plywood were cut to cover the 1/2\" plywood.  The cherry plywood was glued and clamped and let dry.          Using photo 3 as a reference, there are 3 separate cabinet areas. The center cabinet area will be split into two in a later step.  For now, the cherry plywood made in the prior step was  installed so each piece was flush to the center cabinet area.           The back of each cabinet area was measured and a piece of cherry plywood was glued and nailed with 1/2\" brads to it.           The bottom of the side cabinets were also covered with cherry plywood cut to size.         Next two shelves were cut from 1/2\" plywood - one for each of the side cabinets.  Strips of cherry (1/4\" thick) were glued and nailed in the cabinets so their tops would support the plywood shelves.  The 1/2\" plywood shelves received a covering of 1/4\" cherry plywood also.           With the shelves in place, two more stiles were installed using pocket hole joinery to split the cabinets to support the cabinet doors (photo 5).         The shelves were then covered with cherry trim (photo 5).           The cabinets and sides of the galley were then sanded, sealed, sanded with 220 grit, and resealed.  I did this to make it easier to clean up any squeeze out from installing the tile adhesive or the tile grout.         With the cabinet frame complete it's time to install the galley countertop.  I needed 10 pieces of 12\" x 12\" black granite tiles but purchase a couple extra pieces in case I screwed up during the cutting or installation process.           Start by laying out the full sheets of tiles side by side at the front edge of the galley countertop.  Once they are laid out, center them so there is an equal distance on each side of the tiles to the cabin wall.          Mark the location of the tiles as centered and then measure for the left and right side cuts.  A single tile should yield both sides - remember when cutting tiles you want to keep the good edge against the other tiles and the edge you cut goes against the cabin walls or the cabinet frame.  Measure this cut a couple of times to get it right before doing any cutting.         Once the front row of tiles is in place start measuring the back row tiles and cut them to fit.  The final cuts will be the left and right corner cuts and they will use a full tile between them.         Once everything has been dry fit and fits correctly, remove the tiles.            I purchased a couple caulk tubes of tile adhesive rather than getting small bucket of adhesive.  I squirted the adhesive on the galley top and spread the adhesive using a really cheap plastic tile trowel that I could dispose of when done.   The tiles were then placed back into their positions starting at a back corner, working across the back, then adding the front row.   All the tiles were tapped into place using a piece of wood that had been wrapped with old carpeting to make it 3 or 4 inches thick.           Once the adhesive was dry I installed the front cherry trim (this piece was sanded and sealed before installation).         For grout, I purchased a single tube of grout tinted black and applied it according to the manufacturer's instructions.  I only used about a quarter of the tube.           Cleanup was pretty easy since I had already sealed all the wood surrounding the tiles - I just carefully sponged anything that got on the wood off.  If I hadn't sealed the wood earlier it would have left an ugly black stain.  I did take the precaution of using blue painters tape on all exposed wood but when I peeled the tape off there were a couple places it has seeped under the tape.        The center cabinet was split horizontally into a space to store paper towels and a wine rack to hold 3 bottles of wine.  Don't travel with wine bottles in the wine rack - the necks will break! I didn't try it but it's pretty obvious they will.  The wine rack is visible in the first photo in the Lessons Learned section.        A small piece of the cherry plywood was cut to fit in the center cabinet that was tall enough to mount the 120VAC outlet, a couple 12VDC outlets, and some light switches.  Once I had the plywood properly sized in length and the electrical hardware was installed and wired I mounted a couple pieces of scrap wood to the sides of the cabinet to attache the plywood to.          Next a 3/4\" x 2\" x 10\"  piece of cherry was cut and two pocket holes were drilled on each end of the wood and attached it above the outlet box.   I installed a series of shelf supports (1/4\" strips of wood) and cut a piece of cherry plywood to form a top to the small box where the electrical components were installed. Now on to the interior cabin cabinet frames and the drawerThe interior cabin face frames were made with the same materials the galley frames were made of.  They are the same height and don't have a center stile for the doors to close on though, which makes these cabinets appear larger.  Also, they don't have shelves in them - the intention for these cabinets was for clothing, towels, linens, etc.          The cabinet started off with just the bottom shelf that was installed when the sidewalls were installed and also serves as the galley countertop on the other side of the bulkhead.        I cut two pieces of 1/2\" plywood - 24\" wide by 30\" long and installed them to separate the bottom shelf into 3 sections - 2 - 24\" and one 20\" center section.          I marked on the bottom shelf and the bulkhead where these were going to be installed - thin pencil line on both sides of the plywood dividers.         The dividers were removed and three holes were drilled on the bottom shelf and two on the bulkhead where the centers of the dividers were to be installed.  The holes were countersunk in the opposite sides.          The plywood dividers were coated with glue and I held them in place while the apprentice drilled pilot holes and then installed 1 1/2\" #6 screws to permanently mount the dividers.        The next step was the installation of a series of 1/4\" wide wood strips to provide support for the plywood top of the cabinet.  These supports can be seen in photo 8.        The cabinet top was then cut from 1/2\" plywood - this was cut to fit.  It was initially cut to 69 1/2\" wide and 24\" deep, but the cabin dimensions were not perfect so I had to trim a little in width to get it to fit.  Also note the hole with wires coming through it in photo 8.        The cabinet top was glued and nailed to the supports and the two center dividers (1\" brads were used).        The top and bottom cherry frames were cut and the remaining 4 cherry stiles were cut from the same stock as the galley cabinets. Pocket holes and glue were used to create the frame.  I did have to use a small hand plane to shave the frame down a fraction of an inch in width.  I took some wood off both sides with the upper right hand corner being the most difficult to fit - the interior wall had a slight wave in it at that point.        Unlike the galley, these cabinets are deep enough I could use the Kreg Jig to drill pocket holes in the plywood and attach the face frame with screws and glue.          With the cabinet front in place, I framed in the space above the cabinet (photo 10) - it was about 12\" at the front and 6\" at the rear where it intersects with the bulkhead.  This space was left open to hold pillows, sleeping bags, and other stuff and the framing was installed to help hold the light weight stuff in place.         Also notice in photo 10 - at the back of the photo there is a cable run made out of 1/4\" x 3/4\" cherry that is used to cover the wires that were run through the cabin walls and drop down to the \"wiring closet\" discussed in the section on wiring.  This cable run was cut to fit and glued in place once the electrical wiring is in place.The final two photos in this section are photos with the Kreg pocket hole jig and how it was used to create the face frames.

These boards were then sorted through and 18 stiles (upright portion of the doors) were made.  They were cut about 1 inch longer than the finished doors were planned to be to enable trimming during door construction.         The rails were left as longer boards at this stage so I wouldn't be running a 6\" long board across a table saw dado head or across a router bit.         All the cherry boards were routed with a quarter round bit to take both edges off the front of the boards.         The boards were then carefully inspected and the inner and outer door edges were determined for each board and the inner edge was marked for the dado cut.         The dado head on the table saw was set to remove 3/8\" of material in depth and 1/2\" in width on each board.           All the boards were sanded on a belt sander at this stage.         The next step was to cut the rails and stiles to size with the miter saw.  I made 4 interior doors.       Once the miters were cut, I laid out each future cabinet door (face down in pieces) and marked left/right and cabinet position (door 1,2,3,4) and then measured, marked, and drilled the holes for the hinges.           The rails and stiles for each door were then assembled - glue on the common miter edge and 1 1/2\" brad nails to hold the door in place while the glue dried.  I did the assembly on a piece of granite left over from another project so I would have a nice flat table.           While the doors were drying 1/4\" cherry plywood was cut to fit in each door.  When the door was dry, a thin line of glue was applied to the dado cuts in each door frame and the plywood was pressed in and something heavy was placed on the plywood to hold it in place while drying.         Hinges were installed on all the doors and they were dry fit to the cabinet frames.           Once the dry fit was complete they were removed, the hinges removed, door knob holes were drilled, and each door was given a final hand sanding.         After hand sanding the doors, they were sealed, let dry, lightly sanded, and sealed again.         Hinges and door knobs were installed and the doors were installed on the cabinet frames.The interior of the cabin has a big drawer that is basically a box on drawer slides.  I used 75# drawer slides rather than the more inexpensive slides that are typical in home use - I wanted strength and stability and something that wouldn't fail as it was being shaken going over a washboard road.The drawer started with 2 - 1/2\" x 12\" x 24\"  and 2 - 1/2\" x 12\" x 18\" pieces of plywood.           The table saw was set up with a 3/8\" dado blade and each piece of plywood received a 1/4\" deep dado cut 1/2\" in from the edge of the wood.         Measured a piece of 1/4\" plywood (leftover from the cabin wall) to fit the bottom of the drawer.         I really cheated on the drawer - I glued the front and back pieces to the side pieces (don't forget to put the drawer bottom) and used brad nails to hold it together.         Next I mounted the drawer slides on the drawer and the cabinet and inserted the drawer into the cabinet mounted slides.  There was some friction which resulted in creating a 1/16\" shim that I mounted on the back right cabinet slide to fix it.         Finally, I cut a piece of the 1/4\" cherry plywood and glued that onto the draw to provide a nice drawer face and sealed the drawer face.Cabinetry stage is now complete.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FXX/DM27/I81GDO9T/FXXDM27I81GDO9T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJL/0YD3/I81GDNLC/FJL0YD3I81GDNLC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8A/ZREW/I81GDNMF/F8AZREWI81GDNMF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRU/FIW5/I81GDNMU/FRUFIW5I81GDNMU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLN/Z3DG/I81GDOCN/FLNZ3DGI81GDOCN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F18/53W6/I81GDODO/F1853W6I81GDODO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFH/5MVI/I81GDNNS/FFH5MVII81GDNNS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDM/KIRJ/I81GDNM1/FDMKIRJI81GDNM1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F27/G01Q/I81GDOLP/F27G01QI81GDOLP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC7/RDMR/I81GDONF/FC7RDMRI81GDONF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F58/23LZ/I81GDOMT/F5823LZI81GDOMT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ1/YQNI/IMDZKYKX/FJ1YQNIIMDZKYKX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIB/9OOJ/IMDZKYT7/FIB9OOJIMDZKYT7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0V/ZJIW/IMDZKYYS/F0VZJIWIMDZKYYS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ7/0I83/IMDZKZ4T/FJ70I83IMDZKZ4T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO3/XONE/IMDZKZAN/FO3XONEIMDZKZAN.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 12: Cabinetry - Part 2"}, {"step": 13, "steps_text": "The first photo above is my favorite shot of the galley in use - Father's day at the Grand Canyon and my kids are fixing me breakfast in bed - I was served bacon, eggs, hash browns.

Because of the size it needed to be rigid during transportation and to be able to support it's own weight when open - I didn't want one side to sag if it wasn't supported while it was open because of the stress it would put on the hinge.The hinge was a special order hinge that was designed to prevent leakage and I was really concerned about damaging it.      To start the back hatch, I used a pair of dividers and traced a 2\" line along the back of the cabin from the point where the oak hinge struts were to the floor of the cabin.      Once I had the 2\" line on both sides of the cabin, I used the trusty saber saw to carefully cut the two exterior hatch pieces from the cabin.      I then used these two shapes as the guides and drew 5 more arcs on a piece of 1/2\" plywood.      I cut about 1/8\" outside the guide lines for all the arcs to leave wood for final contouring of the hatch.      Once all the arcs were cut, I sandwiched the 5 arcs and the two cabin pieces together and clamped them in multiple locations.  It took awhile to align all 7 pieces up - they were all cut by hand with a saber saw so there were variations unfortunately.      The next step was to drill three holes through the assembly and to insert some threaded rod through the holes and to tighten then all together.      This provided a very solid unmovable assembly that could be taken to a belt sander and the interior and exteriors were sanded to provide a smooth common face on the interior and exterior of the arcs.      The cabin walls where the hatch pieces were also sanded (carefully) to maintain the consistency of the arcs and to provide sufficient space for the gaskets that would be mounted on the hatch and cabin to prevent water intrusion.      I made 3 - 3/4\" x 2\" x 72\" oak struts - one for the bottom of the hatch frame, one for the top.  I then cut 3/4\" from the top and bottom of the curved hatch struts.  The remaining strut was cut to fit inside the two exterior struts and glued/screwed to the top oak strut and to the exterior studs (see drawing).  Like I mentioned when framing the cabin struts - I used double oak struts for where I was installing the hinges for strength.      I also cut 3/4\" of an inch from the bottom of each of the 5 interior struts and cut 1 1/2\" from the top of each strut - I did not cut a full 3/4\" and 1 1/2\" initially - I made each cut a little shy of the final fit size to give me some leeway incase something didn't fit right - once I dry fit each strut and verified how much additional cut was required I finished the cuts.  Note:  I cut from the top and the bottom - just hacking off 2 1/4\" from one side or the other would have resulted in arcs that no longer matched the cabin wall arcs.      The 5 interior arcs were then put into the hatch frame and adjusted until they were spaced 12\" apart - center to center.  This resulted in the wall arcs and the first arcs in from the wall being less than 12\" apart.        With the interior arcs in place, I drilled pilot holes from the bottom struts into the arcs and using 2 1/2\" #8 screws on top and 1 1/2\" #8 screws on the bottom I mounted the interior arcs.        Next I cut the arc cross braces.  I used firing lath again (all the left over pieces from framing the cabin roof were used here).  I don't remember the length I cut the firing lath to - nominally 11 1/2\" for the interior locations and less for the struts between the hatch edge and the first arcs in on the left and right.  I made 36 of these struts initially then added a few additional in to provide support for the hatch latches and for mounting points for the LED flood lights.      It very important to square the frame up at this stage and to remain aware of the need to keep the hatch frame square throughout the rest of the framing process.Installation of the arc cross braces was done using 1 1/2\" brads in the finish nailer.  I would coat each end of the cross brace with glue, position it, and drive 2 brads into each end.  Notice in the drawing and photos that each brace was offset from the one adjacent to it so I could get the nails in straight.  I also put spacers between every arc at the top and bottom of the hatch and nailed/glued these in place.       Once the frame was dry, I installed the hinge and dry fit the frame to ensure everything was good to go for the remaining construction.      The next thing to accomplish is the installation of the hatch latches - I purchased marine grade hatch latches from West Marine and cut a couple 3\" long pieces of angle iron to attach to the cabin walls.  Latch installation was accomplished following the directions that came with the latches and using scrap pieces of the the 1/8\" plywood to get the spacing right on the outer shell of the hatch.  These needed positioned and framed out so they could be mounted to latch the hatch down securely.      Before beginning to cover the hatch with plywood I ran the wiring (two circuits) for the LED strip lights and the LED flood lights.  One flood light was positioned so it would shine on the stove and one was positioned to shine where the dish sink was to be located.  The wires come out the top left corner of the hatch and are terminated with connectors that enable the removal of the hatch.      The final step for constructing the hatch is installing the plywood coverings.  I used the remainder of the 1/8\" plywood for both the external and internal sides of the hatch.        The external side of the hatch was covered first - using a full sheet to cover most the the hatch and some smaller pieces added at the bottom.  This was glued and then held in place with brads until dry.      The interior of the hatch was covered with the remaining pieces of 1/8\" plywood - hence the patchwork in the photos above.        The seams and all the nail heads were all sealed with bondo and sanded down to be flush.        It was then sealed with marine grade epoxy and coated with white primer - inside and out.       When the primer was dry, strips of gasket material were applied to both the cabin arc and the hatch to prevent water from migrating into the galley area.      The hinge was heavily coated with OSI caulk and mounted on the cabin body (it had been dry fit earlier with the hatch) with screws.        The hatch side of the hing was heavily coated with caulk (again dry fit first) and the hatch was moved into position with aid from the apprentice.  The hinge was then screwed tightly down.      The caulk took about 3 days to dry sufficiently to trim it back with a drywall knife.      The hatch lights were installed and the wiring was connected and there was light!      At this stage I realized the hatch bottom gasket kept peeling off so I had to come up with a better solution to keep water out of the galley.   The apprentice came up with a great idea...  \"Dad, why don't you get one of those strips like they have on the garage door\".  Off we went to Home Depot and purchased a single 8' long garage door flang gasket (see photo).  This was cut to size, heavily caulked and screwed into place so when the hatch closes the flang seals the back from water intrusion.  It works really well.      The final step was the creation of a way to hold the hatch open.  I chose the simplest method possible - purchased two 1/2\" dowels and made a couple blocks of wood 3/4\" x 1 1/2\" x 2\" that were partially drilled through with 3/4\" fostner bits and mounted on the interior of the hatch just inside cabin walls.       I also took two pieces of 1/8\" x 1/2\" aluminum bar and wrapped them around the dowels to make mounting points on the galley prep top - these were attached to the galley walls.

The 3/16\" trim was then sanded on both sides with a belt sander which brought the thickness down to close to 1/8\".  This thickness was chosen because the tight curves in the cabin and the desire to hide the edges where the interior plywood and interior walls came together and where the individual pieces of the 1/8\" interior ceiling plywood joints came together.      I also made about 80 feet of 1/2\" quarter round cherry trim by ripping 5/8\" square trim, running it through a planer on the two ripped sides to get 1/2\" square trim that was then routed with a quarter round bit to give me 1/2\" quarter round trim.      Even though all the wiring runs were complete, I still had to finish the installation of the lights, switches, and other electrical tasks but it was time to install the trim.      I glued and used small finish brad nails to mount the trim.  I mounted the 1/2\" quarter round on top of the 1/8\" flat trim along the edges where the ceiling and the walls met.  To get the 1/2\" quarter round to mount properly along the curving roof line, I either cut grooves in the back of the quarter round so it would bend or I cut a series of 2\" to 3\" pieces with the mitre saw and pieced them together along the curve.      Quarter round was also installed on the top and bottom of the shelf at the front of the cabin, where the shelf met the interior ceiling.  The entire interior was coated with two coats of polyurethane (see parts list).  I lightly hand sanded the first coat with 220 grit sand paper after it had dried.      After the interior was sealed the cabinet doors were installed.  Note: the cabinet doors were mounted for fit checks much earlier in the process and were sealed earlier in the process - the cabinet doors were finished products when they were installed.      Then I could work in the floor - I worked on the floor as the final step for the interior finish of the cabin because I didn't want to drop tools or scuff the floor while still trying to finish other parts of the construction.      Finishing the floor consisted of laying 1/4\" cork underlayment on the floor and half way up the front wall.  I selected cork for it's insulation and sound reduction properties rather than using newer man-made materials.  Using the cork as the front wall head board really helps to deaden sound reflected within the cabin and sound coming in from exterior sources.      You get one chance to lay everything out right, so measure and dry fit the cork and plan the installation process by dry running the installation!!!I used a quart of contact cement and a roller to apply it to the cork (let it dry) and the floor and wall were also covered with the same adhesive (let it dry also).      Once the cork was down, I installed the wood flooring.  I followed the manufacturer directions for this.  The hards part of laying the wood flooring was the final run was pretty narrow so I had to rip several floor boards which was a really really dusty process.      After the floor was down, I installed cork for the headboard and installed the final trim around the entire floor covering up the floor edges with 1/2\" quarter round held in place with finishing brads.  Four coat hooks were installed in convenient locations within the cabin.  Three curtains were made to block light, velcro was sewn on each curtain, and self-adhesive velcro was mounted above the doors and around the roof vent to block light.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FLD/ZKTA/I81GDNRN/FLDZKTAI81GDNRN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8G/HC3F/I81GDOM4/F8GHC3FI81GDOM4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1G/TSP8/I81GDNS1/F1GTSP8I81GDNS1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB1/DBIE/IM6LEP11/FB1DBIEIM6LEP11.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP9/E3QT/IM6LEP12/FP9E3QTIM6LEP12.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD5/VNXN/IM6LEP20/FD5VNXNIM6LEP20.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPD/PR1I/IM6LEP23/FPDPR1IIM6LEP23.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FK2/7OJ5/IM6LEP2A/FK27OJ5IM6LEP2A.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 15: Sealing / Finishing the Interior "}, {"step": 16, "steps_text": "So, I'm going to walk you though what I did, then tell you not to do this....  followed by what I'm doing to fix the problem it created.The sidewalls are constructed of 1/4\" plywood and the exterior ceiling is 1/8\" plywood.  I glued, screwed, and finish nailed everything together and thought it would be sufficiently rigid that I wouldn't encounter any problems.  Areas where there were nail or screw holes, seams between sheets of plywood or the seam between the wall and the ceiling were filled with body putty and sanded flat.   Once the sanding was done, I applied two coats of marine grade epoxy to seal the entire exterior.  I lightly sanded the epoxy with 220 grit sandpaper after each coat.   I then applied a coat of exterior primer that was designed to adhere to the epoxy, followed by two more coats of paint.  I used a silver metallic paint from Benjamin Moore - Molten Metallics(621).   The paint is great at hiding all the little imperfections and adds a lot of character.   http://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/for-your-home/p...The problem that I experienced was during the long trip around the USA, we went on a lot of back roads (washboard type) that caused a tremendous amount of shaking and vibration which caused hairline cracking in the various pieces of plywood where they were joined.  Once the crack in the paint and epoxy occurred, there was a place for water to get to the plywood.   Interior grade 1/4\" plywood acts like a sponge when it get wet. This didn't happen for over a year but it wasn't a pretty sight once it occurred.   So now that you know what not to do for your exterior, here is what I've done to fix my problem.   I removed the offending pieces of plywood and sanded the camper down.  The next step was to carefully coat the entire exterior with fiberglass and lay down three coats of fiberglass resin.   The issue with working with fiberglass is the open/working time of the resin and then dust hazard when sanding.   Once the fiberglass resin layer was complete, I sanded after each coat, then primed the exterior again and then re-coated it with the same paint I used the last time.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFA/UDS0/I81GDOFZ/FFAUDS0I81GDOFZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4C/V3YJ/IM7YQ2N8/F4CV3YJIM7YQ2N8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7P/C3R6/IM7YPXTS/F7PC3R6IM7YPXTS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHE/O04Q/I81GDNWY/FHEO04QI81GDNWY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1L/CB7B/I81GDOIX/F1LCB7BI81GDOIX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F63/FYKY/I81GDOJE/F63FYKYI81GDOJE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBR/N66K/I81GDON0/FBRN66KI81GDON0.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 16: Finishing the Exterior"}, {"step": 17, "steps_text": "Loading the cabin on the trailer was easier than I had expected - with one minor catch...  Now I measured everything multiple times before starting this project the trailer bed was 72\" and the exterior of the cabin was 71 1/2\"  everything should have gone smoothly!The trailer I purchased has two uprights at the real of the trailer to connect the rear ramp to while in transit.  Each upright has a small piece of aluminum welded on that extends in just enough that something greater than 71 1/2\" will not load and with the doors mounted the width of the cabin was 72\" - I couldn't load the cabin body with the doors installed.  We lifted the cabin and loaded it on moving dollys in the garage and slid one of the tie down straps through the front tie down location and then connected the tie down to a pair of come-alongs to slowly pull the cabin onto the bed of the trailer.   I put a couple pieces of plywood in front of the cabin skid plates to prevent them from getting jammed into the loading ramp.   Once the cabin was a little more than 1/2 loaded on the trailer (past the center of gravity) it gently tilted down onto the trailer bed and we just pulled it by hand to it's final placement.   We relocated the front yellow tie down passed it through and around the trailer and used the ratcheting mechanism to lock the front of the trailer into place.   The next step was to install the rear tie down and ratchet the rear of the cabin into place.   Installation of the doors and door drip edge took less than 1 hour - the doors and drip edge had been dry fit multiple times and all the screw holes already drilled.  Installation consisted of running a thin bead of OSI caulk on the drip edge and on the door seals, pressing them into place and screwing everything tight.The only remaining steps were to outfit the cabin and galley and to head out for a road trip.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FO4/OVN6/IM7YPP4A/FO4OVN6IM7YPP4A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F91/G9RC/IM7YPNG9/F91G9RCIM7YPNG9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F78/IL0F/IM7YPO5E/F78IL0FIM7YPO5E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZA/RGG8/IM7YPOOC/FZARGG8IM7YPOOC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYZ/LP3J/IM7YPPX7/FYZLP3JIM7YPPX7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF4/VS6V/IM7YPQPP/FF4VS6VIM7YPQPP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGF/TTMX/IM6LEP31/FGFTTMXIM6LEP31.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTY/DO0G/IM6LEP34/FTYDO0GIM6LEP34.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 17: Loading It on the Trailer"}, {"step": 18, "steps_text": "Measure the clearances on the trailer, measure them again, and then compare them to your drawing and verify the dimensions and locations of anything that will be protruding from the exterior of the trailer.   The trailer I purchased has two upright mounts at the back for the rear lights and to hold the ramp in place if I would use the trailer to haul 4-wheelers or snowmobiles.  Unfortunately, the upright mounts make the trailer 1/4\" narrower than the camper with the doors installed.  I ended up with 2 options to load the camper onto the trailer - lift it 4' into the air and slide the trailer under or remove the doors and slide the camper onto the trailer without the doors and re-install them.   I chose the latter - in hindsight, I would have made the camper 1\" narrower and not had this problem.           I did have a concern about the heat from the grill.  I've used the propane stove for decades so I knew it wouldn't cause any problems.  I tested the stove on the brick patio first to gauge how much heat it produced by placing a piece of newspaper under it.  After an hour the top was too hot to touch but the sides and bottom were not and the newspaper under it wasn't singed.  I then repeated the same test in the driveway with the grill located on the galley shelf.  Again, no problem, although I wouldn't leave it operating unaccompanied or open the stove shelf with it operating.If you are not going to cover the exterior of the trailer with aluminum or fiberglass sheeting, prepare for hairline stress cracks in whatever exterior coating you use.  The stress cracks will need to be patched from time to time.           Getting the back hatch to fit properly is an exercise in patience and careful planning.  You have a curved frame that needs to be square and fits the curve of the camper.  Don't glue anything until you have dry fitted the frame and know that it fits as best as you can make it.         Installation of the back hatch latches is difficult - they have to be installed before the plywood is installed on the exterior and interior of the hatch.  They also have to be adjusted to catch whatever you are using as the latching posts - I used some 2\" angle iron that was cut to fit the latching fingers.  Do the adjustments while you can get your hands in to adjust them - otherwise you will be stuck making adjustments a fraction of an inch at a time.     I would add a couple USB outlets to the interior and exterior electrical panels.  They would be 12VDC to USB and panel mounted (last photo)  I would also add a small nook to slide cell phones into while charging in the galley area.  Whenever we had AC power the outlets were always in use by the kids to charge their phones which meant I had phones, wires, and transformers littering the galley area while trying to fix a meal.  The nook would have enabled me to slide the phones and wires out of the way.

We had to design a new, creative and impressive installation, with one extra requirement: it has to include fire. So we began to process, first with some rough drawings and ideas, ending to a top ten out of thirty concepts. Than making iterations on those ten. Finally, with the support of our teachers, we decided to make a game for two persons: we created a danc efloor, where one of the two persons has to stand on. The other person gets a remote, and when the music starts, the game begins! On the dance floor are 4 colours marked, and the person with the remote can decide which colour can light up. The person on the dance floor has to jump on the right colour, and if he gets it correct: a big blowtorch appears as a reward!In the next steps, we'll show you how you can make such a great game from scratch!

Solders would sometimes make their own out of used ammunition shells and whatever else that they had around them.  I was lucky enough to have a bunch of tools at my disposal; I have no idea how a solder managed to make one of these sitting in a muddy trench with virtually no tools.The lighter uses zippo lighter fuel as an accelerate and works in pretty much the same way.  It also utilizes an old Bic lighter and some copper and brass tubing.   I made a few different types until I found the one that I was really happy with.  The hardest part is to decide what type of cap you are going to use for the wick.  For my first couple I made a small cap out of brass tubing which worked fine.  The only problem is they can become loose and could easily be lost.  I then added a chain to one which ensured it at least wouldn\u2019t be lost if it fell off.  In my latest version, I added a dome nut which is more secure and screws into place.There are some tricky sections to make in this trench lighter.   if you are a novice at soldering, then I would probably brush up on my skills before I attempted to make one.   However, if you are willing to take the plunge, then hopefully this ible\u2019 will be of some benefit.Music in the YouTube clip is by DJ RHH.

It\u2019s a quite important part and you need to be able to cap it so the fuel doesn\u2019t dry out.  You can see in some of the images below, I initially went for a piece of tube slightly larger than the wick holder which slipped over it.  I soldered a small piece of brass on top to form a cap.  This works fine and you could just do this is you wanted to.  However, I wanted to have a screw on version so this ible\u2019 will take you through how I did thatSteps:1.       First, you need to make the wick holder.  To do this you will need to drill a hole through the middle of a small bolt.  It took me a few goes before I was happy with the result as I\u2019m sure it will for you too.  You can buy nut-serts which already have a thread on the outside and are hollow.  I made mine though.2.       Place the screw into a vice and carefully start to drill into the top of it3.       Take your time and remove any bits of metal that come away from the bolt so the drill bit isn\u2019t impeded.  4.       You will need to drill about 10-15mm deep.  Once you are happy with the depth, you then need to cut the section off the screw5.       I just used a dremel to cut away the section I wanted6.       Next, drill a hole into one of the 15mm caps.  Make sure that this is off centre as per the images.  The hole should be the same size as the wick holder section you just drilled.7.       Screw the wick holder into the hole and have 3-5mm sticking out the top.  You don\u2019t want too much as the wick will hit the top of the dome.8.

The reason why you do is is to enable the fuel chamber to be secured to the bottom cap.  It's probably the most difficult part as you need to solder the tube to the inside of the top of the cap.  I had to try 3 times before the solder took and the tube became secure.  At the same time you also solder the top cap to the actual chamber.Steps:1.   The tube that you need to solder to the inside of the cap needs to be about 15mm longer than the actual chamber section. You'll cut the extra length off later.  The extra length helps you to ensure the tube is straight inside the chamber when you go to solder.  Cut the tube to length.2.   Next, grab some solder and wrap this around the bottom of the tube.  You need a fair bit as this is will need to secure the tube to the cap.  Add a generous amount of flux as well.3.   As you will need to solder the top cap as well, as some flux to the inside of the cap too.4.   Next drill a hole into the bottom cap.  This will need to be off centre as the tube won't be directly in the middle due to the wick holder.5.   Place the cap onto the end of the chamber with the tube sticking out the end of it.  This is why you have the extra length for.6.   Use a blow torch to heat up the chamber and cap to melt the solder.  Keep the heat on for some time to ensure the solder melts and the tube attaches to the chamber.  If it doesn't work the first time, add some more solder and try again until it secures it in place.  Also add some solder around the cap to secure it to the chamber.7. Trim the tube flush with the chamber.8.  Lastly, you need to place a screw into the bottom of the tube to hold the cap in place.

Wondering if it was just a wonky power adapter, I blew two more before I decided that there was something wrong. Exactly what though, I had no idea. Thinking that the 12V/1A adapter was not giving off enough current, I decided to try a 18V/1.5A rechargeable battery which burnt my nichrome wire into smoke and ash as soon as I plugged in the power source. 1.5A with my current circuit was way too much current, and produced way too much heat for the nichrome to handle.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8J/OUJ0/IIM417SQ/F8JOUJ0IIM417SQ.LARGE.jpg", "/assets/img/pixel.png"], "step_title": "Step 4: First Circuit Attempt"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Doing some more investigation, I found that Brian Schmalz (the designer of the driver) wrote:M+ : This is the power input to the Easy Driver. Connect this to the positive power supply lead. This should be a 6V to 30V, 2A (or more) power supply that is clean (low ripple).I have no clue how on earth I missed this! I think because I read the driver can regulate the current to produce 150mA \u2013 700mA, that I thought that 1A would be enough to power the driver. I ended up buying a 12V/2A adapter and prayed it would work. The problem now, is that 2A would be enough to fry my nichrome, since it\u2019s way more than 1.5A. I had two options: use two power sources, or start thinking a little about physics. If V = I * R, and E = V * V / R, when I used a 9V/1A power supply, I had roughly 9 watts of power going through the nichrome. For 12V/1A, I had roughly 12W. And 18V/1.5A which caused smoke was roughly 27W. Theoretically if I can keep the W down to ~12W, then I should be able to use 12V/2A. So if I added a 10 ohm resistor to one of the heat lines, that should keep it to roughly 9W of heat going through the nichrome. That\u2019s my theory, but my physics was really, really dusty. Since I was really short on time, I decided to rewire things to take on two power sources, with this circuit.So the motor no longer blew out my adapter, and the nichrome played nice when plugged in separately\u2026. However, when I plugged in both of the power sources at once, the motor wouldn\u2019t spin smoothly, if at all.At this point, I\u2019m at a loss and not quite sure what\u2019s wrong with my project. So I\u2019m going to accept the fact that some things just weren\u2019t meant to work for the time being and leave it be. I\u2019ll come back to it after some time with a fresh mind and hopefully I\u2019ll figure out what\u2019s wrong.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ6/THTB/IIM417T0/FJ6THTBIIM417T0.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Second Circuit Attempt"}], "channel": "Microcontrollers"}]
