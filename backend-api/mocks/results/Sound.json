Rear LeftThe un-powered Sub woofer to Rear Right (yes, you read it correct)  which you can see in the photo.Since, cassette players don't have good high frequency response, I added an extra cheap Piezo tweeters in parallel to these existing speakers.(The tiny black one on top of the speaker in the photo)Its time to power up, and inspect and make sure that the things are in good shape. Once powered up, insert the cassette adapter in the cassette slot, take the wire out and connect it to your mobile phone / TV / Computer or any other audio source and crank up the volume.You should be able to enjoy your music loud.TIPS: Some CAR Head units may make noise, which is created by the motor inside them. You may just cut/disconnect the motor as we don't need the motor to spin.If you are lucky enough to get an aux input, that will be awesome. But my Sony head unit needs a proprietary cable which was ridiculously expensive. Hence gone with the adapter.PS: 1.) Most of the head units will require continuous power  to maintain the clock, settings etc.,when there is a power loss, you may have to set those parameters again as per your personnel taste.2.) Don't over load the power supply, else your audio quality will be distorted. If you see dimming lights on the head unit, its a good indication that your cranking too much or your power supply can't handle this load.3.)

One of those two screws is a different size, set it apart from the others.\nWhen all screws are removed, carefully take out the driver and flip it around.\nI say careful because there is a short wire that connects the driver to the cup, break it and you're in trouble.

Also leave at least three inches of wire sticking out of the coil, these will be used later in the headphones. (The voice coil becomes magnetic when electricity is passed through the wire, thus making a magnetic field around the wire. As the current passes straight through the wire, another field is created and this causes a chnage n polarity.

I love an awesome set of speakers or headphones. In fact I love them enough that I spent an entire summer building them while interning in Chicago, at Specimen Products. These are the same people that make all of Andrew Bird's speakers and various other musicians audio gear.  While interning I wanted to build my own set of speakers using similar techniques, and In doing so I learned a lot about how to make a really killer set of speakers, as well as some of the science behind making them.  So here is what you need:  1) Wood, the thicker and denser the better. Use at minimum 3/4\" thick pieces of wood, also your best options for wood are also the cheapest! Go with MDF or if you want them to be a little lighter and look a little prettier go with some Baltic Birch Plywood and make sure to get the good stuff with as many layers of real wood as possible.  2) You also need a method of cutting wood, I used a table saw but if you have access to a CNC that will make your life so much easier.  3) Wood glue  4) At least one driver per speaker, since this was my first one I wanted to as simple as possible. Adding more requires a crossover and various other components that get real complicated real quick.4.5) Also get some terminals, these and the drivers can be found at Madisound  5) A power drill, if you have one a drill press is nice too.  6) Some screws, also do not buy brass screws, I broke at least 3 or 4 heads off of them while making these.  7) Tape measure or a ruler, really you should always use these when doing any kind of hands-on project.  8) Epoxy putty, lets be honest this stuff is magical.  9) Sandpaper, another one of those \"you should always have\" things  10) Bending ply, for these speakers I wanted a little flair so I used some bending ply. If you want just a basic set of speakers just use more of whatever material you used for the rest of the body.   11) A disk/belt sander, in order to get the sides flush faster.  12) A jig-saw or any other saw that will allow you to cut internal shapes.  13) About 12 clamps, if you don't have any or are looking to buy some I cannot recommend quick grips enough!  14) Optional paint  There may be more things that I left out so feel free to shoot me any questions you might have!", "title": "Bent Plywood Speakers", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Bent-Plywood-Speakers/", "section": "workshop", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "To start, you should probably draw out what you are going to be making. I unfortunatly do not have those drawings anymore so I will be skipping that step, Its really just a lot of simple math.Anyway the first thing I worked on was the bending ply, after figuring out just how big I wanted the speakers to be I cut out multiple strips of bending ply until their combined thickness was at least 3/4\". Then I started to stack up pieces of mdf and made a block that was about as thick as the bending ply was wide. I glued the stack together and gave a radius to each corner the bending ply would be in contact. By doing this we make sure that the bending ply wont bend too far and snap. Also be generous with your radius, mine were a little small so the end shape was a little more warped than I wanted. PROTIP: If I was to do this again I would have made a lip around the edge of the form in order to keep the bending ply from shifting or twisting as it set. If you cannot tell already, that happened slightly to mine. It didn't impact the sound, but it did make working on it a little more frustrating.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FRH/B3MJ/HS7QKJ3A/FRHB3MJHS7QKJ3A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDS/LR3L/HS7QKJ3O/FDSLR3LHS7QKJ3O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO3/CNYK/HS7QKJ41/FO3CNYKHS7QKJ41.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Making a Bending Form"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "    Ok so once you have your bending form take your ply and do a test run with no glue between the layers, just to make sure that everything works right. This allows you to correct errors before they happen. The glue will set fairly quick so you really won't have a chance to adjust a lot as you work.     When you have your routine down apply a layer of glue between each sheet of bending ply and clamp it down. Normally If you were to use woodglue on a woodworking project you would want a really thin layer of glue because it actually doesn't take much to have a strong connection. However when you are using bending ply, side on having excess glue, delamination is is not something you want to deal with.     There are a lot of ways to clamp these pieces down, the best method involves a positive and negative form squishing the ply together. However this can be expensive if you are doing something large, but it can be used multiple times.     The way I approached this was by using a vacuum bag. This method is great but requires a good bit of finesse as the vacuum starts because the bag may want to go in-between your ply and your form which could make your ply go all wibbly wobbly in a bad way.      The last method takes a bit more running around, but it will work great. Simply make a form that you can clamp all the way around with. Then try to clamp down as much surface area as possible.     However you decide to go about this, after you have everything glued up and clamped down let it rest overnight. The next day don't be afraid to run to your ply like a kid on Christmas morning!PROTIP: At some point before doing the final run, add masking tape around the form, this will help you so much when you pull the bent piece off after  all the glue is dry.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FW1/1IPS/HS7QKJ3J/FW11IPSHS7QKJ3J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU7/FRCB/HS7QKJ3Q/FU7FRCBHS7QKJ3Q.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Bending the Ply"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Alright now before I go any further you should know a couple things about how speakers and sound work.First off the part that creates sound on a speaker is the called a driver. Drivers work by pushing air around really quickly which, causes the vibrations we call soundwaves. They come in a variety types and emphasize different sections of the sound spectrum. For example a subwoofer will hit deep bassy notes but will not hit the high pitched tones that tweeters will hit. For these speakers I used full-range drivers and the only downside to full-range drivers is that they won't always hit those deep bass notes or those high notes as well as a speaker with multiple drivers would. Unless you are looking to have music that shakes your house you don't really need to have a speaker that goes that low.  Since we want the driver to produce a specific range of sounds we need to make sure that there are no excess vibrations. Any extra vibrations can begin to alter the sound and even negate some frequencies, leaving you with audio quality similar to putting your cell on speakerphone. This is why most high quality speakers are made from mdf or thick plywood as they are great at absorbing vibration and giving you nice clean audio. If you want to go the extra mile you can put some insulation on the inside of the speaker in order to soak up even more vibration. Drivers also require a certain amount of air in their box in order to function optimally and in order to figure out how much internal space you need you can plug in your drivers' specs into a calculator like this *click* . Then use basic math to determine your boxes dimensions based off the volume of air required (volume=length*width*height).The last thing to learn for now is that there are multiple types of speaker enclosures. What I built was an \"acustic suspention\" enclosure, which is basically a tightly sealed box that produces a very clean sound. However if you wanted to add a little flavor to the sound you could add an opening and channel the sound through it. The resulting speaker would sound warmer and possibly have a little more bass. Types that use this method would include horn speakers (thats what Specimen uses) or bass reflex (most boom boxes use this style). The last major style of speaker is an open baffle, which has no enclosure at all. Imagine a plank of wood with a driver smack-dab in the middle of it... yupp... that basically sums up open baffles. Congratulations! You now know a little bit more about speakers!

I am a pro at adapting to these sorts of situations, in  other words I just cut up one more panel.In order to make a nice sleek and clean looking box I add some dado cuts to the sides. This creates a little bit of a stronger connection, as well as making the box easier to assemble. The width of the dado should be the same as the thickness of the material you use for your box and as for the depth, I think I only went in an 1/8\". Make sure you account for this depth when you are writing down your measurements for each panel!   After all the dados are made, Its time to glue up the box! To do this you want to add glue along all the dados and add one clamp on each corner of each square. It will be a pain to do, and as always do a dry run first and then move onto your final glue up.Once the glue has dried sand each side of the box flush. Try and avoid sanding deep into plywood as you will be creating more work for yourself than necessary. If you do, paint is a pretty appealing way to disguise the horrors you create.It should be noted that I added 2 holes to the back panel for the terminals that route power to the driver.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ0/OA7Q/HS7QKJ3I/FZ0OA7QHS7QKJ3I.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTJ/EQ6T/HS7QKJ3D/FTJEQ6THS7QKJ3D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPX/ZAQU/HS7QKJ3B/FPXZAQUHS7QKJ3B.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Tricks to Building a Box"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "When my bending ply had finished drying I found that it had been warped a little bit, to correct this I simply brought it over to a belt sander with a nice broad, flat platen and sanded the faces until they were suitably flat and perfect.I then whipped out a jigsaw and cut a hole for the driver to go in. I could have used a hole saw but I don't think we had one the right size at the time. Four holes were popped into the bent ply that lined up with the center of each panel of the box, and if you can't guess I used those holes to screw the bent ply to the box. I also used some wood glue and made sure to fill in any gaps with woodglue and sawdust, I could have also used some other kind of filler but the sawdust worked great.While working I kept doing test fits of the driver and found that there would be a little gap beneath it. To fix this I used some epoxy putty, making sure not to get any on the face of the driver, and filled in the gap.

The next set I make I will be able to see these obstacles much quicker and prepare for them accordingly.Anyway I made sure to go into a well ventilated area and then attack the speakers with a coat of primer and then a coat of awesome turquoise, or perhaps its more of a sea-foam green who really can say?

A bit smaller is OK. Plywood is preferable since it can't break along the grain that it doesn't have.  Mark the position of the corners of the speaker and glue the blocks there. They will hold the speaker up over the bracket.  If your wood is too thin for screws, use small nuts & bolts (machine screws), the bolts going in from the bottom, and not standing taller than the blocks. I glued some bits of tool drawer liner to the blocks to stop the speakers from sliding.   If at all possible, screw the top of the wall side bracket into a stud. If you hit wood, one screw will do it as long as it goes at least 1\" into the wood (not including thickness of drywall or plaster). Don't screw it down so tight that the bracket digs into the wall, just snug against the surface. If you don't hit wood, then use any of the many types of drywall anchors that expand behind the drywall. I'd avoid the plug type, since they can pull out on impact in this application. Use a second anchor in one of the lower holes if you feel the need for extra strength or fear swinging speakers. In my picture, the shelf is mounted to brick. Plug anchors (like the conical plastic ones that come with everything) are fine for masonry.FYI: If you mess up and trash your speakers I'm not responsible, period.

Also the vibrations from the strings go into the sound hole and resonate out, amplifying the vibrations to make a great sound. When you apply pressure to the strings you can change the wavelength by shortening it and making a higher pitch when you pluck it. My guitar represents sound waves because when you pluck the strings you can hear the sound waves coming from them. It represents pitch/frequency because not only can you hear how loud or quiet the strings are, you can see how fast or slow the strings are vibrating and judge the pitch from that. Frequency is basically the rate at which something occurs over a particular amount of time, so when you hear how a sound and how many times it would repeat from the guitar you can judge its frequency as well. Another way to hear sound waves is the amplitude, which is how loud or quiet they are, so if you can hear the volume of a an object you can judge it\u2019s amplitude.The Doppler Effect is the change of frequency relative to a moving object. My guitar could demonstrate this because if I were in a moving car playing my guitar and there was someone sitting on a bench, they would experience the Doppler Effect as I am driving towards and away from them. This is because as I go towards them the sound they hear will become louder and higher in pitch and the sound waves become tighter and higher. As I move away from them though the sound they\u2019ll hear will become quieter and lower in pitch and the sound waves become looser and lower.Length of body=19.25 in. Width of body=12.5 in. 19.25 inches * 12.5 inches=240.625 inches Volume of my guitar\u2019s body equals about 240.625 inches^2The length of my strings is around 20 inches with the octave\u2019s being around 10 inches. The width of the low E is a 42, B is an 11, and the high E is 9. First string is a low E and its frequency=82 Hz, wavelength=413 cm.; octave is frequency=164 Hz, wavelength=206.5 cm.Second string is a B and its frequency=247 Hz, wavelength=138 cm.; octave is frequency=454 Hz, wavelength=69 cm.Third string is a high E and its frequency=330 Hz, wavelength=103 cm.; octave is frequency=660 Hz, wavelength=51.5 cm.If I could do anything differently I would probably give myself more time to work on it because I really didn't know how long this project was going to take. The type of guitar I was trying to make was a cigar box guitar, but I didn't have enough time to fit the neck to the cigar box. Also tightening the strings were a real pain and I broke them a few times trying to tighten them. Overall though I enjoyed doing this project and enjoyed making my guitar.If I won a laser cutter with this project the first thing I would do is bask in the glory for a minute or two and then immediately call my STEAM teachers saying that our school finally has a laser cutter. For quite a while my school has been building a new maker lab and we have been trying to find a laser cutter to put in this new lab. The labs purpose is to serve our school's students and help them to better understand the connection between what they are learning and the outside world. Having this laser printer we could teach students new skills to better their and the world's future. We already are having a class that is dealing with different CNC cutters and we have talked about a laser cutter, but we don't have the budget to buy a laser cutter. Here is the link to my school's website, were you can see for yourself what our mission is and what we offer.

To build the microphone system you will need:1 x LED, green or red  2 x Resistors 330 Ohm and 220 Ohm respectively  2 x Capacitors 10 \u03bcF and 100 nF respectively  1 x Potentiometer 10 kOhm  1 x LM386-N4 Op-Amp  1 x 9V Battery  1 x 9V Battery Connector  1 x Toggle Switch 1 x male jack plug, which you can propably get from the speaker you used.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FK2/O48Q/IJHJRVF8/FK2O48QIJHJRVF8.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Building the Microphone"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "1. Sensor BlockThe mechanical sensor of the microphone is simply made of an earphone. It provides a flexible membrane that moves a coil around a magnet to generate a voltage.2. Filter BlockIn order to filter out the high-frequency noise that made the interesting signal hard to discern from the noise itself, we added an RC filter as a low-pass filter which cutoff frequency is quite low regarding the dynamic range of the human ear (20Hz-20 kHz). The resistor value R1 is 220 Ohms and the capacitor value C1 is 100 nF. Hence the cutoff frequency is around 7958 Hz. The range that is not filtered out (0 Hz-7958 Hz) contains human voice frequency range (300 to 3000 Hz). So this makes the our microphone efficient for phone calls or anything that requires only human voices. As a result, you might want to play around with the values of the filter depending on the application you would like to use the microphone.3. Pre-amp BlockThe amplification block consists of a Texas Instruments LM386 op-amp. It naturally provides a gain of 20, but the gain value can be modified by connecting components to the gain pins (1 & 8) of the chip. Since the voltage variations of the coil corresponding to the voice was very low, we figured out that we needed a higher gain. By connecting a 10 \u00b5F capacitor to those pins, the gain value increased to 200. We chose to use this op-amp as it is cheap (around 1$) and overall because of its low distortion (< 0.8% for frequencies lower than 8kHz) and its gain that is constant over the range of audible frequencies. Indeed, it was designed as an audio/video amplifier.4. Power-supply BlockThe output voltage of the amplifier is always in the range 0-3V and in the documentation it is specified that the minimum supply voltage is 5V. So any power-supply which voltage was higher than 5V might be used. We decided to use a 9V battery since 9V battery connectors are common to find and make wiring easier. The power-supply block is equipped with a switch in order to save battery and an indication LED.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FYE/LPH6/IJIUSYR8/FYELPH6IJIUSYR8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBR/LBWG/IJQOEXL1/FBRLBWGIJQOEXL1.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: The Hardware Schematics"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "The charts above show respectively the spectrum from the demo sound we played and the spectrum we recorded with our microphone.

Attach the LED to pin 13 as in the Arduino Blink example. To make the touch sensitive part we are going to use the CapacitiveSensor library.The capacitiveSensor method toggles a microcontroller send pin to a new state and then waits for the receive pin to change to the same state as the send pin. A variable is incremented inside a while loop to time the receive pin's state change. The method then reports the variable's value, which is in arbitrary units. We are going to use pin 7 as the send pin and pin 6 as the receive pin. Connecting up the Capacitive Sensor:Connect pin 7 to the positive rail on the breadboard, this will allow us to use pin 7 for multiple sensors.     Connect one end of the 1 Mohm resistor to pin 7 (using the positive rail)     Connect the other end of the resistor to the receive pin ( pin 6)     Connect the last jumper pin to the receiver pin (by connecting it on the same line on the breadboard).

He could tell, since he saw my teeth have cracks in them. This of course didn\u2019t sounded too good to me\u2026 Especially since I like my teeth.. I never had any holes in them and I definitely did not want to start now. So far the cracks were not too serious, but it might well turn out to be over time. Thus, it is tinkering time!Before you read further, please know that this tutorial has been as a \u2018to be finished\u2019 on my computer for a long-long time. In the end I simply finished it. So although this instructable could be better I still hope that you enjoy it. I am not going to write a medical journal on the topic as obviously a lot of information can be found on the internet. Bruxism is not fully understood (including the cause) and a simple solution to prevent it is not really out there. Please see the URL links down here for some quick information on bruxism and some nasty pictures of the possible results on your teeth.http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/brux...After the diagnose of my dentist I noticed that I actually clamped my teeth a lot of times during the day. The simple solution: just stop doing it!  Although it is hard to break a bad habit, it worked. Unfortunately I (actually, the majority of people) mostly clamp/grind their teeth at night. Breaking this habit during sleep is somewhat harder (actually impossible..) since I am simply not aware that I am doing it. My dentist gave me a specially adjusted mouth guard which should help. I can see how this helps protecting your teeth when grinding. I don\u2019t think it actually helps when clamping since the used force will simply be transferred through the mouth guard from lower to upper teeth (albeit somewhat distributed and thus likely result in less pressure per teeth).  So it would be nice to stop the clamping altogether. And that is what this Instructable is about: How to assemble an arduino based device to prevent bruxism by changing your behavior (with a Pavlov reaction). The Idea of a device like this is not an original idea of me. The way of execution is however my idea and I have not simply copied somebodies project. However, I have of course \u2018borrowed\u2019 bits and pieces of others.  It is mentioned in the instructable where this is the case. Some other homemade bruxism devices are:https://sleeptrack.io/2013/04/01/development-of-gr...https://github.com/lucwastiaux/gchttp://chompr.blogspot.nl/There is at least one commercial product I am aware of which I like to list here for the people that want an off the shelf solution:http://mysleepguard.com/sg-international/For my bruxism device I have chosen to measure the activity of my yaw muscles to see if I am clenching. I could have chosen to simply measure the clamping force in a mouth guard. This did not seem a good idea to me because having a battery in my mouth, while clamping.., did not sound to appealing. Nor do wires sticking out from my mouth. Furthermore, measuring muscle activity sounded like a challenge. Could I make that work? Mainly because this is my first Arduino project, some serious tinkering was involved. And I liked it! :)The main idea of the project is this: measure if I am clamping. If yes, then generate a sound with increasing volume. The sound then should trigger a Pavlov reaction, so I relax the yaw muscles. If I don\u2019t relax I will eventually wake up. The longer you use it the better the pavlov reaction should work. I want to measure if any improvement arises, so measured data is saved on a SD card for later investigation. To see any difference, of course first a baseline measurement has to be performed, which is simply not using the feedback of the sound and only saving the measured data.Before we get started, I would like to mention this: Of course some people will (correctly) mention that a common cause of bruxism is probably stress. So the chain of thought might be: stop stressing and the bruxism will disappear. The problem is that even if the trigger for bruxism (e.g. stress) is gone, the bruxism can already be a habit and very hard to break. Especially during your sleep when you are not conscious of the fact that you are doing it. Furthermore, some people simply have some kind of stress in their lives. This might not even be a bad thing, as long as this will not cause mental or physical problems.", "title": "Anti Bruxism/Teeth Grinding Device (arduino Based)", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Anti-Bruxism-Device-arduino-Based/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Please take a look at the pictures and the movie to see what the end result has become.

The white part to the left (of the yellow), are lower frequencies. Movement without muscle contraction is seen as an increase in this part and not/less in the yellow part. A beeping sound is heared when it measures jaw clenching. The sound increases in volume and duration if the jaw clenching continues I have hold one earpeace close to the microphone of the camera to hear the beeping sound. This did not work out too well.

For this example the Arduino with shield is connected to the computer, EMG stickers on my chest and a bespoke program, which is running on the computer, shows the heart signal. The arduino and computer software can be found here: https://www.olimex.com/Products/Duino/Shields/SHIELD-EKG-EMG/The program on the computer takes care of the noise in the signal, which is a common problem with EMG measurement. For this project the Arduino must be working stand alone and not connected to a computer. In the rest of the project I noticed that the noise of the signal is significantly reduced if the Arduino with EMG shield is powered from battery and not connected to the computer and farther away from interfering electronics. The TFT screen can be used to show measured signals and have a better feedback when building or using the device.For the device to be standalone, the Olimex example script was the starting point.

I used an old sport sock type. Cut the toes of your sock so you can put your arm through. Glue the electrodes from the inside while letting the clips stick through your sock. It does need a little bit conductive gel to work correctly. You can put some salt in hand cream, or just use some saliva. After you have made some successful EMG measurements, try to find the optimal spots for your electrodes to measure the jaw clenching signal.

But at the same time a PITA to get them working! Right now I have bought three of them over some period of time, and it seems that the specifics of these shields change for all three. Granted, they all work but it took me a long time how to get so far and probably don\u2019t understand the specifics. Trial and error (and Google) (tri-oogle and Err-oogle) has been my approach here. And when finally the script was correct to get one screen working, the touch of the others don\u2019t work. Or the orientation is wrong or... If anybody has some background information on why this is or how to do it better, please let me know.[simple Touch screen script]Please note that these screens are actually a TFT-screen with a resistance-sensor on top for the touch screen. That means at least two things:The x-y coordinate you get from the touch sensor do not automatically correspond to the correct x-y values of your TFT screen. Meaning: the touch screen gives a value between 0 to 1024 (but differs per screen. Mine between 207 -915 in x direction, and 200-920 in y direction), while my screen has a resolution of 0 to 340 and 0 to 240.  The orientation of the touch sensor will always be the same, even when changing the orientation of the TFT screen (for example with the function tft.orientation(x), where x can be 0 to 3). In my project this means that:   x-coordinate touch sensor = y-coordinate TFT screen  y-coordinate touch sensor = minus-x-coordinate TFT screenI found that the differences between the screens I have are:Different chip used: This means that in reality you have to choose a different \u2018identifier\u2019 in your script. I understood that most of the times the identifier can be read from the chip. With one of my screens this is however not possible. I resolved this by trying all the identifiers I could find for these screens until one worked.  Different pin usage on the Arduino: This can be resolved by setting the correct used pins in your script.  Different orientation between Touch sensor and the TFT screen: This may result in up is down, left is up etc. This can easily be resolved in the script.  Different min-max value used by the touch sensor: As said; in principle the touch sensor gives back a value between 0-1024. However, the used min max values which correspond to the TFT screen may differ. . For easy conversion between the touch coordinates and the TFT coordinates the function \u201cmap(x, min_val_in,max_val_in, min_val_out, max_val_out)\u201d can be used.Annoyingly, the TFT-Touchscreen and the Olimex EKG shield do not play well together. As far as I can tell, the Arduino pin usage do not have to overlap and thus I would expect a correct working of both components. Unfortunately this is not the case. When using both components at ones, the touch sensor only works on approximately 1/4 of the screen. Also the min-max values are changed. I can only imagine that this is some kind of noise picked up between the Arduino pins. I am not sure though. So If anybody knows why this happens and how to resolve it, please let me know.Also, if the TFT screen is fast updated/refreshed then I find that the \u2018z\u2019-value of the TFT screen is not measured correctly.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FE4/75RH/IUSM0LPO/FE475RHIUSM0LPO.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: TFT Touch Screen Shield"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Problem with any EMG measurement is the easy picked up noise. From the Olimex website I understood that a first noise reduction is achieved on the shield itself. Common practice for measuring a representative signal is to use the outline of this signal. I experimented with several versions of this technique of which some seemed to detect the EMG signal better, but found that there are a few problems with it:The signal can be noisy in the surrounding of electrical equipment. Noise in the frequency of 50Hz is picked up and a false positive EMG signal is detected.     Using this technique it is necessary to find and extract the average of the signal. Movement of my body causes a low frequency in the signal from which a moving average always lags and a false positive EMG signal is detected.By looking at the TFT screen while playing around with this setup, I found the obvious: Moving your body changes the signal at a lower frequency compared to flexing the muscle. So why not use a FFT(fast fourier transformation) for signal filtering. A FFT is a method to examine the signal such a way that you can find which frequencies are present in the signal. More or less the same way as happens on your HIFI stereo set when you look at the dancing columns which show how much low frequency (bass) to high frequency (treble) is present in the signal (music). This method immediately takes away the necessity of a \u2018mean value\u2019 of the signal. We simply look at what frequencies are present in the signal.  Please look at the Wikipedia page to find more on FFT or don\u2019t understand what I mean: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform]Using an FFT on your Arduino causes a few difficulties:Executing a FFT is computational heavy and also uses quite a lot of memory. \u2018heavy\u2019 and \u2018 a lot\u2019 is very subjective. However, it is true for an Arduino and I found that getting an FFT to work on an Arduino is not easy. I am not able to program a FFT routine. Luckily I found a library which works for this project.[UPDATE: [UPDATE: Some time after posting this instructable, the first FFT libraries for the Arduino have appeared. These can be simply downloaded using the Arduino IDE] The EMG signal has to be measured at very regular intervals for the FFT to work. This means that we need to use interrupts with our Arduino. Interrupts will be explained later in this instructable.Searching for a good solution to do a FFT on the arduino, I found the splitradixrealT library which, according to the author, is optimized for use on an Arduino. Unfortunately, at the time of typing this instructable, the website I found information on it (https://coolarduino.wordpress.com/2014/09/25/) does not exist anymore. At the time of posting an example script and the library can still be found here:  https://codebender.cc/sketch:176862#SplitRadixRea...It seems like this is the version I use, but I am not sure. Also, maybe there are better FFT routines to be found now, since this instructable has been waiting on my hard drive for a long time. [UPDATE: Some time after posting this instructable, the first FFT libraries for the Arduino have appeared. These can be simply downloaded   using the Arduino IDE]The library can use a large arrays of up to 512 numbers which caused a very high usage of the memory. However, For this project I found that 256 numbers with the correct measurement frequency gave me a satisfactory measurement time (to fill the buffer), while at the same time have a satisfactory frequency resolution. The library works out of the box with an input buffer of 512. But if you know the input will never be longer than 256, the library can be tweaked to use shorter arrays and free up a lot of memory that way. Go to the SplitRadixRealT.h file and Change the following:FFT_SIZE: set to 256     LOG2_FFT: set to  8,  because 2^8 = 256     NWAVE: set to 256     Sinewave: Delete every 2nd number. This way you still have a preprogrammed sinewave, but with the half of numbers     Hamming: Delete every 2nd number. This way you still have a preprogrammed sinewave, but with the half of numbersPlease note that when I say \u2018tweak\u2019 I mean that I do not fully understand the inner workings of the library, but as far as I can tell it uses less memory and still serves the purpose of this project.As you can see in the video, the signal will pick up very easily the 50Hz from the electricity net. In the beginning of the movie you see already a small peak, but when plugging in the lamp (which is not even on) this peak gets bigger. However, the yellow part of the FFT is chosen such, that this peak is just outside it's range.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FYZ/K6S7/IUSLWSLU/FYZK6S7IUSLWSLU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDO/8N5Q/IUSM0OR3/FDO8N5QIUSM0OR3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Signal Filtering Using FFT on Arduino"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "Ok, we can now measure an EMG signal and show it on the TFT, but of course a sound feedback is necessary. For this feedback, I want to have a simple signal of 1 tone which is not TOO annoying. At the same time the Arduino should be able to change the volume and length of the tone from the software. This way, if I hear the sound, but don\u2019t stop clamping, the sound volume goes up and lasts longer. As far as I can tell, there is no easy arduino library or way to do this. You have the \u2018tone\u2019 function, but this is not able to change your volume. So I developed my own code, which by the way is kind of crude. It uses the idea of creating your own formulated PWM signal on a digital pin. Actually, it consists of two PWM signals at different frequencies. Please remember that a digital pin can only have two values: 0 Volt and 3.3 Volt. The \u2018home made\u2019 PWM signal I am talking about is simply turning the digital pin on and off very fast.PWM signal at approximately 170 Hz. This is the tone you will hear.    PWM signal at approximately 60kHz. This will enable us to play the 170Hz tone at different volumes. It will act as an actual PWM signal to mimic an output signal between 0-3.3 Volts corresponding to the duty cycle . The frequency of this PWM signal is above the hearing limit.Ok, here we have a problem: The Digitalwrite function is not fast enough to get the 60kHz used for the volume regulator. Digitalwrite uses  3.6 or 4.8 microseconds to execute (frequency = 1/(2*4.8*10^(-6)) = 10.4kHz as a maximum frequency. The solution is found in the low level programming in Assembly code. Assembly code can set an output of the arduino to low or high in approximately 400nanoseconds. This means that the maximum frequency is theoretically (frequency = 1/(2*400*10^(-9)) = 1250 kHz. More than enough for this purposePORTD |= _BV(PD1); //Set pin 1 high\nPORTD &= ~_BV(PD1); //Set pin 1 low\nCheck the second picture in this chapter for the correct adresses of the other pins. With a loop and some kind of delay function we can now create our pwm signal at a frequency of our choosing. Unfortunately the arduino Delay function is to slow. Again, use Assembly code for a delay function with a very short interval. Please search the internet for more information on these Assembly functions.__asm__(\"nop\\n\\t\");   //On a 16MHz Arduino this line takes about 62.5ns to executeThis is nice, but why not simply use the PWM outputs provided on the arduino? As far as I\u2019ve read, the maximum frequency of an PWM output is 500 or 1000Hz. This means that it cannot be used as volume \u2018regulator\u2019 because it is still within the hearing limit. In that case we have to:still create the second PWM volume \u2018regulator\u2019-signal by turning this pin On-Off very fast. So there is no win there.    set the provided PWM signal of 500Hz (or 100Hz) to a more pleasant audible frequency. This is possible (by changing something in the timer of the interrupt this PWM signal uses) but there is no simple \u2018set-other-frequency\u2019-function.As said, this is my first Arduino project, so for me playing around with the already set timers etc did not sound like a good idea.At the end of this step you can find the snipplet from my code which creates the sound. It is triggered when teeth clamping (TMG) is measured and the volume and length increases each time this loop is run. If there is no TMG measured, two variables are set to zero and the next time the sound starts at low volume and short length again.I connected the ground wire of the headphone extender cord to the ground of the Arduino and the both left and right wires to pin 1 of the Arduino. Pin 1 is used, because it seemed that every other available pins picked up noise when the tft-touchscreen was refreshed. It was not loud, but loud enough to keep me from sleeping. Please note that pin 1 is used when uploading a sketch to the Arduino and this won't work with the headphones attached. That's what the extender cable is for; before uploading the sketch unplug the headphones first.if(TMGdetected == True)){      \n        if(TMGepisodeStart==0){\n          TMGepisodeStart = millis();\n        }\n        uint8_t lengtegeluid[7] = {1,2, 2, 3, 5, 10} ;//ms\n        uint8_t volume[7] = {1, 1, 2 ,2 , 3, 3}; // piezo: {50,70, 90,90,90, 90} *20\n        uint8_t anop = volume[PrevSound];\n        uint8_t bnop = 225-volume[PrevSound];\n        \n        DDRD |= _BV (1); // pinMode (1, OUTPUT); \n        \n        for (int i=1;i<10*lengtegeluid[PrevSound];i++){ // this loop simulates a low frequency (about 170Hz) PWM signal to generate a tone\n          for (int j=1;j<120;j++){  //this loop simulates a high frequency (about 67 kHz) PWM signal to be able to mimic volume</p><p>            PORTD |= _BV(PD1); //Set pin 1 high\n            //do a delay loop. every nop (no operation) command gives a 62.5 nanoseconds delay.\n            for (int k=1;k++){</p><p>              __asm__(\"nop\\n\\t\");\n            }\n            \n            PORTD &= ~_BV(PD1); //Set pin 1 low\n            // do a delay loop. every nop (no operation) command gives a 62.5 nanosevonds delay.\n            for (int k=1;k++){</p><p>              __asm__(\"nop\\n\\t\");\n            } \n            \n        }\n          delay(4);\n        }\n        \n        digitalWrite(pinsound,LOW);\n       DDRD &= ~_BV (1); // pinMode (1, INPUT);     \n         if(PrevSound<5){\n           PrevSound++;\n         }\n         if (TMGepisodeStart>1 && TMGepisodeStart+2000           TMGepisodesCount++;</p><p>           TMGepisodeStart = 1;\n         }</p><p>}else{</p><p>        PrevSound = 0;</p><p>        TMGepisodeStart = 0;\n      }", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F7F/K2GB/IUSLWRX8/F7FK2GBIUSLWRX8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8N/DLQ0/IUSLWRPX/F8NDLQ0IUSLWRPX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4C/ZXPG/IUSLY9AK/F4CZXPGIUSLY9AK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Play Sound With Volume From Arduino"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "An interrupt is a special kind of function which will be executed when some kind of trigger (I\u2019ll explain later what these triggers can be) is detected. If a trigger is detected then your script stops what it is doing at that time, executes the interrupt function and returns back to where it left your script. This means that interrupt functions can be triggered outside the flow of your regular flow of your program.This can be useful when you want to detect the pressing of a button, or the rising or falling of a signal. If a button is pressed, the corresponding function is called. The interrupt is also useful if you want to do something at a regular interval. For example; an PWM signal and also the \u2018tone\u2019 function uses an interrupt to set the output signal high and low at a certain time interval (=frequency).Thus, there are two types of interrupts:Pin interrupt (also called external interrupt): Execute a function when a change or value on a pin has been detected. Timer interrupt (also called internal interrupt): Execute a function when a certain amount of processor cycles have been count. Thus this interrupt is triggered by a certain cycle count number.For the FFT to work, we need to have a measurement of the signal at a constant frequency (= time) thus for this project we need a timer interrupt. Don\u2019t let yourself be intimidated by the complicated looking programming, this is due to the low level programming that is necessary to set this timer. Although I have found easy to read functions for using external interrupts, I have not found these for internal interrupts. Please take a look at the website below from where I have learned most of what is necessary to use interrupts on an Arduino:http://www.engblaze.com/we-interrupt-this-program-...Using an internal interrupt basically needs two things:Setup: Some code in which you specify how much processor cycles have to be counted before executing the function. Please take into account that a 16MHz (ie UNO) processor counts twice as fast as an 8MHz (ie. Lillypad) processor. Interrupt function to be executed. Make sure this function is as short as possible since it is a standard setting to switch of interrupts inside an interrupt. This to prevent executing an interupt when being in an interrupt inside an interrupt inside an interr....  you get the drift.Please note that you have to use the keyword \u2018volatile\u2019 when declaring a variable when there is a chance that this variable value can be changed in the interrupt. For the compiler this is an indication not to optimize this variable, so that any change in value is seen by the program. It has something to do with when to (re)read the stored variable value from the memory. There is plenty information on the internet if you like more in depth information on this topic. Just remember to use this keyword. For example, the variable \u2018nri\u2019 is changed inside the interupt, thus it is declared as:volatile int nri = 0;Strangely, the values inside the array variable \u2018f_r\u2019 are also changed inside the interrupt but does not need the \u2018volatile\u2019 keyword. \u2018f_r\u2019 stores the measured EMG values from the olimex board and is used as input for the splitradixrealT FFT library. Actually, there is even an error message from the library when using \u2018volatile\u2019. Does anybody know what might be the reason?One more word of warning: Since an interrupt temporarily stops other interrupts, it can mess up time critical communication between arduino and other components. For example, the Serial output to the computer might behave strangely, or the output to the TFT might give strange outputs. For this project I therefore choose to halt the interrupt when writing to, or drawing lines on the FFT screen or read the touchscreen input. The interrupt must also be halted when doing the FFT, since the array variable \u2018f_r\u2019 cannot change when performing this task. Furthermore, since the input of the fft is also time critical (the reason we started with interrupts in the first case) the filling of the variable array \u2018f_r\u2019 cannot be stopped to execute script that takes a long time. Against my own wisdom I did however choose to stop the interrupts for the short part of the script which checks if the touchscreen is pressed.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZA/ELV3/J4G54KYP/FZAELV3J4G54KYP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Using Interrupts on Arduino"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "For this project I also want to store measured values to examine at a later time.

I thought it is better to use the slimmed down sdFat library. Actually, the standard SD library is just a wrapper around the sdFat library. Using the sdFat library not all functions are (easily) accesible. However, for this project only a few simple functions are needed and thus the sdFat library suffices.There are two basic things I want to achieve:1.       Find the latest stored data file (for example dat003.txt) and add +1 to the number for the new (to be stored) data file.2.       Save all the data we want in comma separated values in a text data file. I do not store all the raw EMG measured data, but instead chose to store value of low frequency, value of high frequency, if there was a sound generation and of course time.Please note that I am using the millis() function to keep track of the time. This is not the correct way of doing this since millis is supposed not to be accurate in all instances. Since millis() is also interrupt driven and thus is influenced when using other interrupts. This means that millis() can lag because its intterupt will not be called when inside another intterupt. Please also note that millis() overflows after 50 days, but I don\u2019t think we will have big problems with this for this project.However, I assume that the error in time this function gives will be small (far within minutes over the course of one night) and thus will not be a showstopper for this project.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FVI/OHUZ/J4IPTY9A/FVIOHUZJ4IPTY9A.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Store Date on SD-card Using the SdFat Library"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "There are three different memories inside an Arduino. This project (like most Arduino projects) makes use of the first two (EEPROM is not used):Flash memory: this is where your program is stored     SRAM: this is where the sketch creates and manipulates variables when it runsEEPROM: also a memory for variables, but for long term storage. Information stored here is preserved, even after a arduino restart or power failure.When programming I first encountered a filled SRAM memory which at that time was the cause of large arrays used by the splitradixrealT library. After that I continuously encountered a full flash memory which is the result of a large program. Instead of immediately buying an Arduino with more memory space, I tried to optimize my code while implementing the different features of the script. I am not going to talk about it into depth, since it is probably a subject fitting for its own book. Below are a few tricks I used which resulted in a smaller script. At the end of the project I was literally searching to save a few bytes here and there, just to fit it on my Arduino.  Please note that since the compiler generates machine code to upload to the arduino, the used flash memory is not one-on-one the amount of characters of the typed script (but you probably already know that).  The compiler is pretty smart, so when you Use #define for constants which do not change when running the program, this saves space.     The 'Maps' function is just one line long, therefore it takes up more space than not using a function for it. So, don't use the function but use the line directly in the code to save some space.  Please note that you have to make sure you divide by 'long' and not 'integer' to prevent truncation of numbers. The maps function will then be: MyMappedNumber = (MyOriginalNumber - in_min) * (out_max - out_min) / (in_max - in_min) + out_min;A function is usefull for saving space when it contains two or more commands of code.

Then there's cables coming out of the back of the box into the speakers.This means I can switch between my stereo, with record player plugged in, or my Bluetooth amp, and whichever one is selected will play out of the one set of speakers.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FP5/ISDS/JMAV8OYY/FP5ISDSJMAV8OYY.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: What Is It?"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "(You can skip this bit if you don't care. I quite like writing and this thing will probably end up being really long, so I'll try to point out when you can skip stuff.)The issue is that it's easy enough to add Bluetooth to an old stereo, and you'll find a million and one tutorials telling you how, but they all rely on a spare input, or sharing one.You're really unlikely to be able to share an input with a record player though. If your amp has a phono stage built in, you don't want to be plugging anything but a record player into it (and if it has a phono stage it's probably got another input anyway), and if it doesn't have a phono stage then you'll be using a phono pre-amp, and you don't want to share an input with another amp because it'll cause interference and could damage one or both of your amps. There's also a chance of it causing damage to the sensitive electronics on the stylus, but at the very least you'll get feedback.So once I'd ruled out using splitter cables, I realised that what I was most bothered about wasn't really using one stereo, it was just not having two sets of speakers. I wondered whether I could just set up a Bluetooth amp and plug that and my other amp into the same set of speakers. When I read up on it I found that the problem there is basically the same, in that you can't have two amps joined together by their outputs, because you'll very likely end up with two dead amps. You could try being careful, and always make sure you switch one off before switching the other on, but chances are at some point you'll forget and BANG! Wrecked it.I started searching for a switching box and found a few, but they were pretty expensive for what they were. Ludicrous! So I figured I'd make one. I found this tutorial, which did what I wanted but assumed having two external amps. I only had the one, so I knew I'd need to make a Bluetooth amp as well, and I figured I might as well put the amp and switch in the same unit.As it happens, I went and put both inputs on my box anyway. Bit of future-proofing never hurt anyone. (Sarah Connor aside, obviously.)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8S/Z7EK/JMAV8QP9/F8SZ7EKJMAV8QP9.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Explanation"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "I chose the stuff I used after fairly careful consideration, so I'll give you the list but then try to explain my thinking.A DPDT switch5m 1.5mm speaker cable8 banana plugs (I used these cheap ones) - you'll need another 4 if you're not including the Bluetooth amp internally 6 pairs of speaker binding posts (cheap ones here) - you only actually need 4, unless you're future-proofing like me An amp boardA 5V buck converterA ground loop noise isolatorA couple of small lengths of 26AWG wireA USB Bluetooth 4.0 adapterA short 3.5mm to 3.5mm (jack) cable like thisAn enclosure - I used a cigar boxSo, my thoughts (you can skip this bit if you just want to get on with it)...The switch: I liked the one they used in the tutorial I linked before, so I found one similar. I'd already decided I was going to use the cigar box (because I didn't want to buy a new enclosure, and it being wood would make it easy to use) and I thought the heavy mechanical switch would look good against it.Speaker cable: Mine was from B&Q but they didn't have the 5m length on their website. If I was choosing again, I might choose something slightly thinner (or a bigger enclosure) because it was a bit of a pain to manipulate in the space, but since it's carrying the audio signal go as thick as you can manage.Banana plugs: I just went with cheap ones because the point of this whole thing was to do it cheap. They're not great, but they allow me to unplug it all without messing around threading wires through posts. You could just omit them though if you wanted.Binding posts: Cheap ones. Same reason as above. The amp I used wasn't great so I didn't really see the point in going all out on the stuff connected to it.Amp: More thought went into this. I wanted to be able to use a laptop power supply because I didn't feel confident playing with power supplies and figured using a barrel jack would be tidy and low risk.  I also wanted to be able to just plug the Bluetooth adapter in with a 3.5mm jack, in case I wanted to upgrade or plug something else in instead. So I trawled AliExpress for an amp that took a barrel jack for power and also had a 3.5mm input socket. I also didn't want something too powerful. My speakers are 90W max input so it needed to be less than that, so I went with a 50W per channel stereo board. Ideally I would have chosen a better chip (I spent a while reading about different amplifier chips) but the one I went with ticked my main boxes and was cheap, which meant if I messed it up I wouldn't have spent a load of money. (It's worth mentioning that this is my first real attempt at making anything, so I was being cautious.)Buck converter: Ten a penny really, but I went with a USB one so I could just plug it all together when I was ready.Ground loop noise isolator: You'll need one of these if you want to power the Bluetooth receiver off the amp board. When I first put it together I had two power supplies - one for the amp and one for the Bluetooth - which is too much when you've got other stuff plugged in too. If your output and input share a power supply though, you'll get a load of horrible hissing and popping noise, but one of these little things filters the signal to remove that. I also bought another one to put in my car because I use a Bluetooth receiver in there and can hear all the electric noise my turbo and indicators produce otherwise.Wire: Wire's wire. Or is it? 26AWG is easy to work with and I bought a bundle of little lengths because I figured they'd be handy for other stuff.Bluetooth adapter: I wanted one that would be always on, so I didn't have to listen to it talk to me whenever I connected. I also wanted Bluetooth 4.0 to get the best sound I could for my money. Actually, it took a while to find the right one, but the one I got worked a treat. The only issue with it really is that it has a bright flashing green light on it, but once it's inside the box you can't see that so it doesn't matter.Enclosure: I really wanted to use a sleek aluminium case, or order a 3D printed one, but it was going to more than double the cost, so in the end I found a cigar box in the garage and went with that. I think it was a great choice actually. It was easy to work with, looks pretty cool, and if I'd messed it up it wouldn't have cost me anything.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F1H/VA1K/JMAV8OY3/F1HVA1KJMAV8OY3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Parts"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "I used:A drill with various sized wood-boring bits (10mm, 7mm, 6mm and 2mm, though that all depends on the exact parts you use) A rotary tool with a small sanding bit (which I'd only just bought and I made a bit of a mess, but it was on the back so it's not the end of the world) A soldering iron Solder Wire clippers/strippers A pair of long-nose pliers A small adjustable spanner A ruler A pencil A small flat-head screwdriverYou might want to use a helping hand for the soldering", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FVW/TTOH/JMAVD2BR/FVWTTOHJMAVD2BR.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Tools"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Once I'd got all my parts, and found the cigar box, I had to figure out how best to lay it all out.

That was basically to avoid tipping the whole thing up every time I switched it over. The switch is fairly stiff so I thought if I put it on the front it'd be awkward, and if I put it towards the front or back on top I'd risk tipping it over.I put the amp at the front so that the volume dial and power LED would be visible and accessible. It could have gone in the lid with the dial and light on top, which might have made it a little easier to get to the stuff inside, but stereo stuff normally has the volume dial on the front, so on the front it went.The binding posts (inputs and outputs) needed to go on the back to keep them out the way.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F71/TE95/JMAV8OTR/F71TE95JMAV8OTR.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Decide on a Lay-out"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "On the back, I figured I'd put the outputs at the top and the inputs at the bottom. If you look at the first picture on this step you'll see how I laid them out. I measured the width of the posts and the distance between the two on each set and drilled holes for them all, measuring out and marking where they'd go beforehand. The mistake I made was in putting them too close to the bottom of the box, which made screwing them together inside a right pain.The laptop charger had a chunky bit that would need a decent-sized hole to get it through the back of the box, and I didn't have a drill bit big enough, so I drilled a 10mm hole and then used the rotary tool to widen it. I didn't have a small enough sanding bit so used a sharpening bit instead and basically burnt the wood away until the hole was big enough. What a mess! But I only have limited tools, so I had to improvise. (Plus, as I said, this was on the back so I wasn't too worried.) It would have been neater just to use a needle file but I didn't have long to do all this while the little'un was napping inside, so I was in a rush.On  the top, I used my ruler from corner to corner in both directions to mark a small diagonal cross in the middle of the top of the box. I then measured the diameter of the screw thread on the top of the switch and drilled a hole where my cross was. Luckily it was 10mm, which meant I had a drill bit big enough and wouldn't need to widen it. (We know how that went last time.)I measured across the front of the box for the volume dial and marked a spot that would mean the amp would be about a centimeter from the bottom of the box inside (knowing the nut holding the volume dial in would hold it steady) so air could circulate. (I don't imagine it'll get particularly warm, but better safe than sorry.) I measured the distance from the centre of the dial to the centre of the LED and marked a spot to drill for the LED.I realised just before drilling that the post for the volume dial wouldn't reach all the way through, so I measured the width of the nut that holds it on as well. I drilled into the front of the box first, but not all the way through. Then I drilled within that indent a hole the width of the post. That meant the post would go through, and the nut would tighten and be flush with the outside of the box. Hopefully you can see what I mean from the second picture. I then drilled the LED hole.(Check out my great drawing if you need any extra help understanding any of this.

Cut some appropriate lengths of speaker wire for the internal connections. I needed two lengths to connect the amp to the switch, two to connect the external input to the switch (remember there're two inputs, but I'm only using one), and two to connect the switch to the outputs. So six in total, and I cut them to about 12cm each.2. Speaker cable is dual wire, so before stripping some outer plastic off you'll need to split the two wires down the middle, enough to allow you to work with it. I found that about 4cm down each end worked.3. Then strip about 15mm of the plastic outer sheath away from each wire on each end, so that's four wires stripped per length of cable. Twist up the ends so they're tidy. Stray strands of wire in here could result in ruined amplifiers, so make sure there're no strands floating about.4. The two lengths that you're going to connect to the amp need to stay straight on one end, but on the other end of those, and on both ends of every other piece, bend the wire over a thin screwdriver to give you an open hooked shape on the exposed wire, like a shepherds crook.5. Soldering time. You're going to cover the curved wire ends in solder. This will help you connect it all up (because the nuts on the switch and the binding posts will grip the single soldered chunk of wire better than a load of twisted strands) and it'll stop stray strands, which could cause shorts. Hold your soldering iron out and basically drape the hook over the top of it so the tip is heating the wire. Hold the solder on the top of the wire (so the wire's between the tip of the iron and the solder) and when the wire is hot enough it'll act like a wick and suck the solder into it as it melts it. You don't need loads; just enough so you can see it in and on the cable. (Careful not to melt the plastic sheath further down.)That's the wires ready. You should have six lengths of cable (each consisting of two wires) with all of the ends exposed, two of which will be straight on one end and hooked on the other, and the other four will all be hooked on both ends.(Later you'll need cables to connect your stereo to the box and the box to your speakers, but you'll have two of those already, currently connecting your stereo to the speakers, and you should have plenty of cable left over to make the other two with.)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FUR/4X26/JMAVD2CK/FUR4X26JMAVD2CK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Preparing the Cables"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Now to start putting it together.

(It's worth reading through that whole article as well. It's good and might further help to explain what we're making.)I chose to have the top row of the switch as my Bluetooth amp (so I used the cables with one hooked and one straight end here) and the bottom row as the connection to my stereo, so that when I turned it over and set the switch into the lid of the box, what was the top when I was looking at the underside of the switch would become the front row in the box when the lid was closed. That way the wires weren't all going to be crossed over each other.You're going to hook your hooked and soldered wires round each peg and tighten the nut onto them. It'll be a bit fiddly, but the soldering you did will make sure you don't squash the cable and end up with strands splayed out of the sides.Once you've done that, you can slot your switch up through the hole in the lid (from the inside, so the switch is protruding out the top) and fasten it with the nut if you want, though it's probably easier to leave it till you've connected the wires to the rest of it inside.(One thing to note here, is that I decided on the binding posts at the back being right and left when looked at from the front, so that my right-hand speaker would be connected to the output on the right from the front and wouldn't be crossed over.

It doesn't really matter which two, since the other two are unused anyway. Again, pay attention to your rights and lefts.(Right is red, by the way. Rs go together.

You need to go positive to positive, and negative to negative.My amp board's power input, like most barrel connections, has the positive on the pin/tip and the negative on the sleeve. The jack (where the power plugs in) has three pins that are soldered to the board and protrude from the underside. The one at the side detects if there's a plug plugged in so you can ignore that. The one at the back is for the tip (so will be positive) and the one at the front (nearer the edge) is for the sleeve (so will be negative).(This Sparkfun page has some info about barrel connectors if you want a visual of that.)Solder your two wires to these pins on the underside of the board.

Avoid other types of ceramic capacitors (such as X5R, X7R, etc.) for audio path, as they will distort sound. I tried both film (Panasonic ECH-U series) and C0G ceramics and found no difference in sound quality. Ceramic capacitors however pick up vibrations as noise (only audible if you tap the capacitor directly) - some of you might not like that. I used the gain setting of -7.22db, which is unusual, but I was using in-ear phones that are very sensitive and only needed small power to get loud enough volume.

Collect the MAX9812L pre-amp and one 9.5 mm electret mic capsule from the components list.2. Figure out which of the electret capsule's leads is the ground connection using a multimeter.  Set your multimeter to its continuity test mode, touch one of its probes to one of the electret capsule's leads, and touch the other probe to the side exterior of the electret capsule.If your multimeter makes a beeping sound and indicates electrical continuity, then the lead of the electret capsule that you're touching with the multimeter's probe is the ground (\u2013) lead.      But if your multimeter makes no sound and does not indicate electrical continuity, then the lead of the electret capsule that you're touching with the multimeter's probe is the positive (+) lead.3. Slide the leads of the electret capsule through the two through-holes at the end of the pre-amp next to the \"MIC\" screen print label, ensuring that the ground (\u2013) lead of the electret capsule is making contact with the mic ground (\u2013) contact of the pre-amp.  (Note:  Don't push the capsule all the way down so that its base contacts the surface of the pre-amp's PCB.  No more than 1/4\" of the capsule's leads should extend through the through-holes of the pre-amp PCB, allowing the mic capsule to be lifted off the surface of the pre-amp's PCB once its soldered in place and oriented forwards after bending the leads.)4. Bend the electret capsule's leads so they're flush against the bottom surface of the pre-amp board and gently bend the electret capsule forward until it's facing outward / forward.  See the last picture of this step for reference.  The goal is to position the electret capsule as close to this final intended position as possible before soldering it in place.5. Keeping the capsule in position with your fingers, turn the entire mic pre-amp upside down.  Secure the pre-amp PCB with a set of helping hands and secure the mic capsule in place with a small clamp.6. Solder the electret capsule's leads to the through-hole contacts on the pre-amp's PCB.7.

Secure the USB mic enclosure in a fixed position using a set of helping hands.  (It's easiest to clamp at least one helping hand below the main enclosure around the thin gooseneck, and another clamped farther down the gooseneck above the USB plug for added support).2. Secure the mic pre-amp either with the miniature vice or another pair of helping hands. Orient it such that the top side is facing downwards for easy soldering (i.e. make sure the side with the screen printed labels and surface mount components is facing down towards your work bench).3. Route the exposed braided leads of the USB mic enclosure's wires through the appropriate through-hole connectors of the mic pre-amp in preparation for soldering.

Secure the Female USB-A Panel Mount cable and 1/8\" male audio cable with helping hands so that their respective wire leads can easily be put in contact with one another when soldering.6. Gently twist (interlace) the exposed wire leads together to create secure connections between the wires of the USB and audio cables in advance of soldering them together.

Slide the smallest 3/32\" diameter heat shrink tubing pieces into place to cover the exposed solder joints of the four wire connections, and use a heat gun or lighter to shrink and fix them in place.9. Slide the 1/4\" diameter heat shrink tubing piece surrounding the audio cable over the two connected audio cable wires and heat it to secure it into place.  None of the audio cable's braided copper ground wire should be visible.10.

It has 6 terminal pins arranged into two rows of 3, so it's effectively like two SPDT switches in one.1. Cut four 4.5\" - 5\" pieces of 22 AWG solid core copper wire and strip off about 1/4\" of insulation off the tips of each end.  Ideally you'll want two pieces of one color and two of another so it's easier to differentiate the two halves of the DPDT switch from each other.2. Take the DPDT switch and secure it within a small vice clamp or set of helping hands.  Take two of the copper wires of the same color and solder them to two adjacent terminals in one row of the DPDT switch.  (It's easiest to thread the wires' exposed solid core tips through the DPDT switch's terminal holes and use some pliers to wrap the tips around the terminal so they don't slide out when soldering.  You may also want to use additional helping hands to hold the wires in place for soldering).3. Solder the two remaining copper wires to two adjacent terminals in the other row of the DPDT switch but offset them so they don't align with the connections of the wire's in the opposite row.

I laser cut the enclosure out of 1/4\" thick plywood and found it necessary to use a large rubber mallet to help fit all the pieces flush together. The design's dimensions are intentionally tight to ensure a strong friction fit, so it may be difficult to fit together with your hands alone.  If it's too difficult to fit the pieces together with your hands alone, try a combination of sanding and gentle hammers with a rubber mallet to fit everything together.  Be careful to not bend or apply too much pressure unevenly when assembling, otherwise you may break some of the thinner pieces like the front speaker baffle. 1. Situate the base of the enclosure (the long 8.5\" x 4.85\" piece with no engravings on it) on your work table.2. Attach the side pieces to the base piece you gathered in the previous step so that the engravings are pointing outwards and not upside down (e.g. the numbers in the spectrogram engravings are not upside down).  Regardless of whether or not you use the included engravings, to correctly orient the piece with cutout ports, make sure that piece is oriented so the cutout ports are closest to the base piece (see attached pictures).3. Attach the rear piece (the small square piece without a large hole cut in it) to the open side of the enclosure that's closest to the cutout ports in the side piece you attached in the previous step.4. Attach the front baffle piece (the small square piece with a large hole cutout for the speaker) to the opposite end of the enclosure from the rear piece you attached in the previous step.5. Fit the top piece onto the top of the enclosure to ensure it fits snuggly.  Orient it so the laser engraving is facing outwards and the smallest number in the spectrogram's x-axis (0.1 seconds) is closest to the front baffle piece you attached in the previous step.6. At this point the empty enclosure will be completely assembled.  Remove the top piece attached in the previous step in preparation for the next assembly steps. (Note:  I never had to use wood glue and clamps to assemble the 6 enclosures I've made, but you may find you need to do this if you've inadvertently cut your wood using overly high temperature and slow speed laser cutter settings - causing the friction fit to degrade.

The downside is that the Butterworth filter has a slow roll-off for the gain, so it doesn't isolate the D string as much as we'd like.

For the Chebyshev filter, the simplest way to design it is to use this following website: http://www.wa4dsy.net/robot/bandpass-filter-calc. Since the Chebyshev filter is a more difficult to understand mathematically, this is an easier way for less experienced students to understand how to make this filter. We based ours off of the 4-pole filter engine. Just select the Chebyshev .1dB for filter type, and input your desired string frequency, 147 Hz for D3. For the capacitor values, you decide those. Any value from 1 \u00b5F to 1 nF should be good. We used 1 \u00b5F for ours. You also decide the bandwidth that you want to use for your circuit. A good way to calculate your bandwidth might be (X#[Hz] - Xb[Hz]). If your note is X, this will give you a bandwidth that ranges from one note up to one note down from your desired note. For D3, that is D#-Db, or 155.6-138.6. You can always go one more pitch away on both sides if you like, just to give a little more room in case your guitar is out of tune, or you can just tune your guitar before you test your circuit. The last part is the gain. Now that you know how much your guitar outputs, you can design a circuit that will give you a gain such that (Input * gain) = Desired Speaker VoltageIf you need even more gain, you can always duplicate your circuit again, hooking the output of the first one to the input of the second one, and the output of the second one to the speaker.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 4: Circuit Design - Chebyshev"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "The basic design concept for the Butterworth filter is that you will have a low-pass filter, and a high-pass filter.

When designing this type, you want to pick your X1 and X2 to suit your string. This will mean that any frequency between X1 and X2 will output sound. (There still might be some sound outside of your frequency range, due to this filter type having a slow rolloff. This is to be expected, and is one of the reasons that a Chebyshev filter design is preferable.)  For D3, you might pick D#3 and Db3, or maybe E3 and C3. The frequencies you pick will determine your resistor values for the low-pass and high-pass filters. Pick a value for your capacitors. Something between 1\u00b5F and 1nF will work fine for your purposes. For finding the resistor values you'll use, use the equation Fc[Hz] = ( 1 / (2*pi*R*C)), where your Fc is your X1 or X2 frequency, and you picked your Capacitor (C). For your low-pass filter, you'll design it using the image shown on the top, with the resistor on the top line.

The last difficult part is hooking up your guitar and your speaker to the circuit. For your guitar, you'll need a jack that will plug into it. I would recommend a jack that has no wire on it, just the metal extensions, because if yours has a wire, you'll need to remove it. Of the two metal pieces, one should be much longer than the other. This one will be hooked up to your ground. The other one will be the input of your circuit, so you'll hook that up to the input terminal of your circuit. For your speaker, there should be a + and - terminal. The - terminal will be hooked up to the ground, and the + will be hooked up to the output of your circuit. You should be all ready to test your circuit now. Power your op-amps, using batteries if you like, and then play the string you picked and see what you get. If it doesn't work right, check the connections into the op-amp first. Another good thing to check is that everything is grounded properly. This also means that everything that is grounded is connected together.The video shown above is a test of our circuit.

The advantages: with the instrumentation amplifier and opamps I could've integrated analog filters in the circuit filtering out the noise before amplification. The disadvantage was the resolution of the ADC: 12bits, which is a minimum in biopotential measurements.    I could've used an external Analog Frontend chip which is designed for biopotential measurements. This is the path I took. I've chosen the ADS1299 Analog Frontend IC from Texas Instruments, which has circuit protection, 8 programmable gain amplifiers (x1 - x24), 8 delta-sigma modulated ADC-s with 24bit data resolution, and sampling frequency from 250SPS to 16kSPS.The board design is the minimal setup based on the recommandation in the datasheet. Since the ZYBO board is supplied with 5V DC, the ADS needs +2.5V, -2.5V and 3.3V, but my batterys output voltage was 4.2V when fully charged, power converter circuit was necessary for the supply. The power efficiency is a key factor in battery operated circuits, so the use of DCDC converters was inevitable. The first step in a power supply design was the polarity protection. This could be done in a series diode, which would let current flow only if the polarity is rigth, but the diode has a small amount of voltage drop. Another possibility would be with an anti-parallel diode, and fuse combination, but this requires 2 components. Yet another possibility is using a transistor as low- or high-side switch. I've chosen the MOS-FET based high-side switch with low on resistance transistor. The high-side switch was used because when off, there is no voltage in the circuit.The battery voltage was Boosted to 5V with a Boost DCDC converter. This supply was used to power the Soc board, and for generating the positive analog suply. The analog supply was generated with a LDO linear power supply. The negative supply was created with an inverting Buck-Boost converter. Both DCDC converters were designed based on the MC33083 driver ICs datasheets recommendation. While using switching mode power supplies one must be cautious of the generated noise, especially in a signal acquisition circuit. I made sure the noise was on an acceptable level by designing the converters to work on 50kHz switching frequency, while the sampling frequency of my ADC will be less or equal to 2kHz. Even though we can be certain the circuit will work correctly based on the Nyquist criteria, I measured the AC to DC ratio, and it was under 0.02%.The 3.3V supply was used from the ZYBOs PMOD supplys.With these considerations in mind the DAQ board was designed in EAGLE cad, ", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FL2/BTN5/IMNQOYSP/FL2BTN5IMNQOYSP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1V/R0FE/IMNQOYTF/F1VR0FEIMNQOYTF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB3/8MUX/IMNQP11N/FB38MUXIMNQP11N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F95/5P6P/IMNQP11J/F955P6PIMNQP11J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F89/8M5E/IMNQP11M/F898M5EIMNQP11M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4F/PZW2/IMNQP11O/F4FPZW2IMNQP11O.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: The Design of the Analog DAQ and Supply Board"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "In order to have an accurate date on every data attached to the database, the date must be constantly updated.

The base configuration can be downloaded from the Resource Center Some customization must be done to my device: The BL2 module will be connected to a PMOD connector so an UART peripheral must be mapped to EMIO pins. The ADS1299 communicates on SPI protocol, so the SPI is outrouted also. An I2C peripheral is needed for the serial EEPROM with MAC address.

Since I had more experience with hardwares/firmwares , I've chosen the second method. Since the embedded ARM processor has two physical cores, I wanted to create a fast firmware to one of the cores, and an operating system to the other core. The first thing to do is the configuration of the SPI peripheral, and the ADS1299 analog front-end.

For data transmission the polled transfer function was used.The configuration sequence is as follows: RESET, STOP_DATA_TRANSMISSION, WRITE_DATA_REGISTERS, ENABLE_DATA_TRANSMISSION, START_ACQUISITION. This sequence is a must when configuring the ADS1299, since after reset, the IC automatically starts to transmit measured data, and won't save register changes.

Using only the amplification and the software filter would only cut out a small part of the noise, but it would also cut out some of the useful data. The solution to this problem is to use an analog filter before the PGA. As we saw in the previous steps, two filters must be implemented, a 50Hz bandstop filter for the mains noise, and a 250Hz lowpass filter for the high frequency noise (and anti-aliasing).The Bandstop filter design:A second order bandstop filter was designed based on the filter transfer function Hbs = H0(s^2 + w^2)/(s^2 + (w/Q)s + w^2), w = 2*pi*fc, and Q = fc/(fb), where fc is the center frequency, fb is the stopband width, H0 is the gain. Since the purpose of the filter is to cancel out the noise, and not the amplification, H0 = 1, fc = 50Hz, fb = 2Hz. For the implementation a modified Bainter-topology was used as shown in the second picture. The Bainter-topology has the advantage of matching independence ( the Q factor of the filter only depends on the gain, not the resistor matching opposed to the Sallen-key).The Lowpass filter design:A forth order lowpass filter was designed with two second order filter stages: Hlp = H0*w^2/(s^2 + 2*e*w*s + w^2), w = 2*pi*fc, where fc is the cut-off frequency and e is the damping ratio. I've chosen a filter with H0 = 1, fc = 250Hz, e = 1 parameters. The chosen filter type was the multiple feedback topology (MFT). The MFT LP filter is prefered, because it has high Q factor, and narrow pass-band relative to the Sallen-key topology. The only drawback would be the inverted output signal, but I used 2 stages, so this wasn't an issue.A swept sine wave input was used to test the overall behavior of the filter (last picture).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F02/4AZI/IN70UQYW/F024AZIIN70UQYW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1Z/SSZA/IN70UQZS/F1ZSSZAIN70UQZS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBZ/SKOY/IN70UUPM/FBZSKOYIN70UUPM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1U/OBGA/IN70UUQN/F1UOBGAIN70UUQN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEJ/G1FG/INI7W97L/FEJG1FGINI7W97L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRW/YO6F/INI7W97M/FRWYO6FINI7W97M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM2/UE83/INI7W97Q/FM2UE83INI7W97Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZA/CD75/INI7W98F/FZACD75INI7W98F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6F/FEB4/INI7W98N/F6FFEB4INI7W98N.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Analog Filter Stage"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "To create the data plotter program you can either use Eclipse or the new Android Studio ( I went with the later option).

The coefficients were generated in Matlab, and will be used in HLS. If the coefficients are specified only once, we can specify them as constants at the start of the function. If we want to change the coefficients we can leave in the arguments, but the storage must be a dual port RAM/ROM type since the optimisation requires it.The first digital filter will be a 65 point FIR filter.const int firlen = 65;\n\nconst int dWidth = 24;\n\ntypedef ap_fixed<dWidth + 4, 4> fir_t;<br> The fir_t type will be used for fixed point data type. We need a storage register for the input data, a temporal register, and a storage register for the sum of products.fir_t xStore[firlen];\n\nap_int<dWidth + 4>tempX;\n\nap_fixed<dWidth*2,dWidth-8> sum;<br>The sum register must have a size that can handle 65 24b*24b values sumed.We need to define the filter coefficients as ( the values can be copied from Matlab):fir_t coeffB[firlen] = {...};In an infinite loop we store the input values, convert them, and proceed to the MAC operation.while(1){\n\tfor(int i = 0; i < firlen - 1; ++i) \n\t\txStore[i] = xStore[i+1];\n        temp = (ap_int<dwidth +=\"\" 4=\"\">) *(x++);<br></dwidth>\txStore[firlen-1](dWidth + 3,0) = temp(dWidth + 3,0);\n\tsum =  0; \n\tfor(int i=0; i < firlen; ++i)\n            sum += coeffB[i]*xStore[(firlen - 1) -i];\n}\n\nLast but not least we need to convert the fixed point value to signed integer in the loop.temp = fir_t(sum).range(dWidth -1,0);\n\n*(y++) = (ap_int<dwidth>) temp;</dwidth>Now it's time for C synthesis. We can see (Figure 1) that just a small amount was used from the resources, and the estimated timing is 15.33ns. We can optimise the filter by pipelining the storage and MAC loops with #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1Similarly, the IIR filter can be made.This time the process is as follows: Shift the input registers and store the next value.   Write the MAC operations ( for the input and output registers).   shift the output register, and store the output.   return the output.The last picture shows the synthesiyed structure after pipelining the filter.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FY3/KGYC/IN365G2M/FY3KGYCIN365G2M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFD/9OXN/IN365HJT/FFD9OXNIN365HJT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAD/J80G/IN365G2L/FADJ80GIN365G2L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9P/AQJB/IN365GGU/F9PAQJBIN365GGU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7C/GYP4/IN365JX3/F7CGYP4IN365JX3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 11: Using the Filters From HLS And/or the FIR Compiler"}, {"step": 12, "steps_text": "On a Linux OS some files are needed for the embedded operating system: a device tree folderu-boot Linux kernel .

My instructable will fill in all of the blanks, and provide you the details and design understanding you would need not only to produce this speaker, but a speaker of your own design, with parts of your choosing. The below link does not contain enough information to build a speaker, alone.https://www.instructables.com/id/Elder-Bluetooth-S...This guy has a speaker store. He sells speakers, and plans to make speakers. I followed the above instructable and liked the aesthetics, followed the links (which may also be monetized) to see the types of components he used, and then after seeing that the details were omitted (and charged for), immediately researched how to created a speaker on my own. I don't believe that financial motivation belongs in the \"building/instructables\" community. Particularly the dimensions, design choices, and electronics of my speaker are of course all my own, and this instructable provides much more detail than any other of it's type for someone to create their own, uniquely.Besides the design method and plan, and a list of all of the tools/calculators/electrical components used, I've included detailed drawings of the cuts of wood I've used. I dimensioned the box based on the actual dimensions of the wood I had so as to avoid making cuts, but you will likely have to customize yours a bit. Also, this speaker is not battery operated, but could easily be upgraded by buying the relevant kits made for the board I used.Since I knew nothing about speakers before starting this project, I've included (too much) detail regarding the crossover, as well as some fundamental electronics, so feel free to skip over this if you figure yourself advanced.", "title": "DIY Stereo Bluetooth Speaker (2x30W)", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Stereo-Bluetooth-Speaker/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Before getting into the design of the speaker, I'll list all the stuff I used. There are many different amp boards, speaker drivers, and crossover types, but for simplicity, I'll just list what I used and explain what you can change yourself in the relevant section. Throughout, I may use \"speaker driver\" to mean the familiar cone shaped electronic component that actually makes the sound, just to set it apart from the speaker as a whole (wooden box (cabinet) and all).***SAFETY***:-Disposable respirator (routing, cutting, sanding)-Chemical cartridge respirator (staining)-Safety glasses (routing, cutting)-Ear protection (routing, cutting)TOOLS:-a (sliding compound) mitre saw capable of cutting 1x8\" @45 degrees, or a table saw and digital angle gauge (my neighbour helped me out with his table saw, but didn't have a digital gauge, so it took sanding to get a perfect 45, see late)-a method for cutting the back plywood piece down to the precise size of the front piece (doesn't have to be clean, a jig saw would be fine)-a router, with either a routing table and a straight bit of basically any size or a rabbeting bit deep enough to cut the depth of your front baffle piece (i.e. the distance from the bearing to the edge of the bit) This creates the channel that the front baffle sits inside. Also a 45 degree chamfer bit for finishing the holes on the front baffle... you could use a roundover bit too, but I prefer the way the chamfer looks-a drill with lots of bit sizes, particularly big ones for the speaker holes. For the speaker drivers listed below, you need a 3\" for the woofers to show through, as they will be mounted on the inside, facing out, and 1.25\" for the tweeters, which press fit into place. If you finish these holes anyways, it doesn't matter if they're rough, but a forstner bit would be ideal. I didn't use a drill press because cedar is soft, but with hardwood it might be advisable. Other holes must be drilled for the switches, lights and inputs on the back. Because of the geometry of the inputs/lights/switch, you may need to countersink these holes, which necessitates a forstner bit of between 1\" and 2\". I personally carved room for mine out with a dremmel, but if you use hardwood, making room for these components will require more forethought.-(optional) an orbital sander... but it makes it easier!-(optional) corner clamps-(optional) hot glue to keep the components and board fixed within the speaker-(optional but highly recommended) a DMM for checking a handful of things (see later)-soldering iron and solder-sandpaper to remove coating from inductor wires (usually red) to expose metal-masking tape to wrap up the box when gluing-stain for the box and back panel (I used minwax ebony)-danish wood for the front baffle (I used Danish oil)-wood glue-2 pieces of wire to complete the crossover (connect -ve terminals of speaker drivers). I save mine from changing light fixtures in my house! (copper isn't necessary).-wire strippers or careful use of a knife/pliersWOOD:- ~7-8' of 1x8\" pine (or plywood, but I would highly suggest pine) for the box. I used clear (as opposed to knotted)- ~2' of 1x8\" wood that looks nice for the front baffle piece. It can be hardwood, but I used cedar- Some ~1\" plywood for the back panel which will be cut to the exact same size as the front baffleElectronicsNOTE: In the U.S., \"Parts Express\" has the largest selection, and Quebec based \"Solen\" as a Canadian counterpart. I used Solen but you can find identical components at Parts Express. If you're going to buy parts from Solen besides the ones I've listed here, I would browse on Parts Express and then try to find them on Solen, since their website is a little lame and has few reviews.-A stereo bluetooth amp - This amp is VERY simple, in the sense that it has cables for functions like a volume knob, aux in, indicator lights, power toggle, and other features are all sold separately, and simply plug in. Because of this simplicity, and the fact that it's Bluetooth, it's expensive.This amp provides 30 W to each of the left and right channels. There are 15 and 50 W varieties, but 30 W is enough for the actual speakers (drivers) I have chosen. You could very easily pick your own amp, and the only things that will change are the power supply requirements (more later) , and the location of the inputs. In the future, I would personally use a cheap, simple amp that had good reviews in terms of quality. The lights are for show, and bluetooth isn't the be-all-end-all given that it wouldn't be portable. You're also paying extra for the boards capacity to easily add battery power. A fun option would be a 2.1 (2 channels and a subwoofer) amp. To prevent confusion, I won't add a link, but you can find a 30W 30W (L&R) +60W (Sub-Woofer) amp for ~$15 dollars, with a DC power jack, red/white RCA input, and volume knobs for each channel fixed onto the back. This could reduce the cost of this project to well under $100.The bluetooth on this board is known to be a little spotty, so to be safe you need the cable set which provides aux-in, below. My bluetooth works perfectly fine, but I will mention a quick fix suggested by Dayton (the manufacturer of the board) to correct one issue. There is a ground wire grouped with the cables used for the aux-in jack, and I believe Dayton has now removed this wire, but if not, then you should just remove it. See the PDF attached. It is the wire next to the already empty slot. I think this is caused by a \"ground loop\", where essentially 2 \"grounds\" are at different potentials. If this occurs when using a different setup, a solution would be to use a \"DC-DC isolating converter\".https://solen.ca/products/electronics/bluetooth/ka...-The \"cable packages\" I got. The amp comes with cables for the signal out to the speaker, as well as power. The \"functional\" cable set comes with a volume knob, power on/off toggle cable, aux-in cable, and a battery cable (not used here). The \"LED\" cable set comes with 3 cables (red, green, blue) to be used for power, bluetooth, and charging indicators. I used 2/3.https://solen.ca/products/electronics/bluetooth/ka...https://solen.ca/products/electronics/bluetooth/ka...-The \"woofer\" (x2) - This is really what is called a \"full range speaker\", meaning that it is intended to perform fine in most of the audible frequency range. Feel free to look for another full range speaker. It can have a different \"impedence\" (more later), diameter, \"sensitivity\" (more later), or \"frequency response\" (more later), but keep the \"RMS Power (handling)\" (more later) in the 30W range, since the amp only provides 30W.https://solen.ca/products/speakers/home-speakers/f...-The \"tweeter\" (x2) - These little speakers \"respond\" (more later) to high frequencies better than the full range speaker, and so they will be used to supplement the full range woofer. The same goes for the tweeter as for the woofer in terms of selecting your own, but this specific model has received very high praise.https://solen.ca/products/speakers/home-speakers/t...Crossover components:In addition to the amp and speakers above, simple passive electronic components (inductors, capacitors, and (not for me) resistors), make up what is called the \"crossover\" (more later, but the gist is that the range of frequencies that make up the music needs to be \"split up\" between the speaker drivers based on which frequencies that speaker \"handles\" them better... this will make much more sense later! For example, if you just used a single full range speaker for each of the channels (left and right), then no crossover would be required). There are many different types and values for these components, so although none of them are very expensive, you should take time to ensure you order the right part, or otherwise discuss it with someone at your local electronics store.-Capacitors (x2) - This will depend on the following steps. The value chosen is for the impedences of speakers drivers I chose above, as well as the \"cutoff frequency\" (more later) that I selected. I have 2 listed here, since the capacitance I calculated I would need was actually 12.62 nF. The closest sum of 2 capacitors I could get was 12.68. As it turns out, I only ended up using the 12, but I will discuss this later. For capacitors (not inductors), the \"polarity\" (more later) of the capacitor matters since they need to be put into the circuit facing the right way. There are several different types... at several different price points, but selecting a \"non-polar\" capacitor will avoid you needing to check which direction the capacitor should face in the circuit. Generally, if it doesn't say \"polar\" it's not. These components could be picked up from a local electronics store as well. The error on most capacitors is typically +/- 10%, so as a rule of thumb for use here, getting a capacitor (or capacitors) which add up to within this range will be fine. I'll explain how they will be wired together later if you get more than 1.https://solen.ca/products/capacitors/non-polarized...https://solen.ca/products/capacitors/dayton-metall...-Inductor (x2) - The value of these inductors will vary in the same way as the capacitor, with a couple of notes. Firstly, there are a few types of inductors, but you should use an \"air coil\" inductor (just wire wrapped in a circle a precise # of times to get a desired inductance). You may see the term \"litz\", which simply means the wire is braided, and for our applications is not necessary. It is supposed to give you better power delivery by minimizing losses due to the tendency for current to be concentrated on the surface of a wire, and does this through increasing the surface area of the wire (splitting it into strands). Solen is a very good place to get inductors (for those at home and abroad alike), since they make their own in house (? solen = solenoid ~ inductor ?). Unlike capacitance, there is no easy way to measure inductance (for spot checking or otherwise), so all the more reason to ensure you get a quality one.https://solen.ca/products/inductors/standard-induc...Other electronic stuff that didn't come in the kitSourcing these will depend on several factors. For me, for example, Solen doesn't sell knobs, DC power jacks, DC power supplies or switches like Parts Express, so I had to buy these at a local electronics store. You could also use amazon. Note that the cable kit does come with a knob on the \"potentiometer\" (the electronic component which is the volume knob), but it's a little ugly. The DC power jack is absolutely necessary, and so too is the switch. I've provided links to the local electronic store where I purchased my parts so you can see that they're exactly what I used, as well as Amazon, so you can see that these don't have to be very particular.DC Power Supply: everything you need to knowA gajillion electronics in your house use a DC power supply, and they are made up of a little box, which converts your sockets AC power to DC power. The power of the supply is of course the voltage output times the current output Power(W)=Voltage(V) * Amperage(A), and all 3 of these things vary from supply to supply. These 3 values will be written on the black adapter box of the power supply.To understand power, voltage, and amperage in the context of a circuit, consider this analogy. The water pipes leading to your home have a certain pressure, determined by the pumps out of the water treatment plant. If this pressure is too high, the piping in your house may get damaged. This is like voltage in a circuit. Voltage is determined by the power source, and can damage a circuit if it is higher than the components are designed for. If you want more water to flow out of your tap (since you can't increase the pressure), you must open up your faucet. This is analogous to amperage. A circuit requests a certain amperage of the source, and assuming the source has enough power, it will provide it. Ultimately, the amount of water flowing out of your tap is analogous to the power of the circuit. The circuit requires a certain amount of power, just like you might desire a certain flow of water, and to get that given a fixed voltage, or pressure, a circuit draws more amps, and you open your faucet.Back to circuits, here are some scenarios that will demonstrate whats OK and NOT OK for power supplies. Take as an example a 12V 5A circuit. A 12V 5A power supply would be perfect, but with a...1) 12V 10A power supplyPerfectly fine! The voltage is not too high so as to damage the circuit, and although the power supply CAN supply 10A for a total of 120W of power, it only has to work half as hard, since the circuit only requests 5.2) 24V 5A power supplyVERY BAD! The voltage is too high, and may damage the circuit3) 6V 5A power supplyKINDA BAD! The voltage is too low to provide enough power to the circuit. For a simple circuit like a speaker, it may end up being fine, just quieter than it's possible full potential.4)12V 2A power supplyKINDA BAD! The voltage is fine, but when the circuit attempts to draw 5A of current, it will push the adapter of the power supply beyond its limits, possibly overheating it in an attempt to supply more amperage and thus power.For the amp listed above, the recommended power supply is 12-24V and 4A. Theoretically, this means you need a power supply with between 12 and 24V and at least 4A. Practically, however, it's likely that if you had, for example, a 24V*2A power supply, you'd be okay, since the recommendation suggests that the minimum power required by the amp is 12*4=48W, so at 24V (which is within the acceptable voltage range not to damage it), the amp may only draw 2A. I personally used a 19.5V * 2.31A = 45W power supply. The supply is not 4A, and technically doesn't even reach the apparent minimum 48W suggested power. This suggests that the amp does not actually use this much power, and thus draw this much current.However, despite this working perfectly fine, if you want to be safe, get a power adapter that is between 12-24V and at least 4A. The obvious choice would be the standard 12V*5A. I've linked one below, and I would put money on you having one at home.https://www.amazon.ca/RioRand-Power-Adapter-Supply...Power JacksPower plugs are composed of metal tube with a pin inside, called the \"barrel\" and \"pin\" respectively. This will be important later when talking about polarity, but I'll leave that for now. Plugs and jacks mate male and female and are defined purely by geometry. The most common dimensions are 5.5x2.1mm (the plug on the supply above is this).If you're gambling on a power supply you have kicking around at home, I would get a 5.5x2.1mm jack (female end).https://www.amazon.ca/5-5mm-2-1mm-Female-Charger-S...It is important to understand which contacts on your jack correspond to the contact which will touch the pin, and barrel respectively, in order to match the polarity of the power source with the polarity expected by the amp, so as to avoid damage. I will explain this later, but I thought I would mention it now.Knobshttp://www.mroelectronics.com/mro/product.php?id_p...Any knob you like will do. You just pull the rubber head off of the supplied volume knob (officially called a potentiometer) and put yours on with a set screw.Toggle switch for on/offThere is a power switch that comes soldered onto a toggle cable, but it is an \"on,on\" switch, and does not work for use as a power on/off switch. Be sure to look carefully to make sure your switch is On/OFF or ON/OFF/ON (off in the middle position), and is NOT MOMENTARY, otherwise it will be spring loaded to the middle position. I made this mistake (see later).http://www.mroelectronics.com/mro/product.php?id_p...", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F51/CNUC/JCAUINU3/F51CNUCJCAUINU3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXE/0DUW/JCAUINVC/FXE0DUWJCAUINVC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBU/HXYP/JCAUM3UW/FBUHXYPJCAUM3UW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCK/WR06/JCAUM3UX/FCKWR06JCAUM3UX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBD/SJ3D/JCAUM3V0/FBDSJ3DJCAUM3V0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSX/1XWS/JCAUM3V1/FSX1XWSJCAUM3V1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCG/LUDQ/JCAUM3VW/FCGLUDQJCAUM3VW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPN/8Q22/JCAUM3VX/FPN8Q22JCAUM3VX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMD/1SWA/JCAUM3VY/FMD1SWAJCAUM3VY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO1/TENH/JCAUM3VZ/FO1TENHJCAUM3VZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F45/6BDQ/JCAUM3W0/F456BDQJCAUM3W0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH0/HBKE/JCAUM3WW/FH0HBKEJCAUM3WW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5X/2BKB/JCAUM3XT/F5X2BKBJCAUM3XT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGI/LB1D/JCAUM3YD/FGILB1DJCAUM3YD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FII/7XFR/JCAUM3YT/FII7XFRJCAUM3YT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7I/H4DT/JCAUM3ZO/F7IH4DTJCAUM3ZO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGY/O45S/JCAUM402/FGYO45SJCAUM402.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW3/G0FH/JCAUM40V/FW3G0FHJCAUM40V.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBF/0ARZ/JCAUM41B/FBF0ARZJCAUM41B.LARGE.jpg", "/assets/img/pixel.png"], "step_title": "Step 1: Tools/ Materials"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "As mentioned earlier, crossovers essentially are the circuitry between the amplifier and the speaker drivers themselves, and serve to split up the range of frequency of the music being played, and have each speaker play the frequency they are best at.There are many many kinds of crossovers which I won't go over here, but the gist of it is that for each channel (in our case, the amp has 2 channels, each of which plays a distinct track where frequency changes with time to produce music), there must be a closed circuit with at least one speaker (which acts as a resistor, a load) in that circuit. If 2 speakers were, simply placed in parallel with one another, they would receive the same waveforms with the same amplitudes. To limit each speaker to playing only the frequencies they are best suited to play, low-pass and high-pass filters are used. These do just as the name suggests, and let pass either high or low frequencies. The woofer has a low pass applied to it, and the tweeter a high pass. The simplest form of these filters is the application of an inductor and capacitor into the circuit respectively. The value of these are specifically chosen to increase/decrease the amplitude the the voltage (the volume) to the woofer and the tweeter at the same time, so that an even, level \"frequency response\", with not spotty areas exists. The frequency at which the woofer and tweeter phase into one another as they trade off being quieted or being full-volume is called the \"crossover frequency\". It is defined as the frequency at which the amplitude has decreased by a factor of sqrt(2), and after that point the amplitude exponentially decreases to 0. This point is selected based off of the frequency response graphs. These graphs are provided with any speaker driver, and show the dB response (volume) at a given power for each frequency in the audible spectrum (to 20Hz-20kHz). For a woofer and tweeter, you can simply find a point before the woofer response gets messy, and after the tweeter has reached full response (becomes level). See the attached images.For interest's sake, and to refresh my differential equations skills, I've written out a rough derivation of how these filters work, and how we arrive at the simple equations that explain how these passive component values are selected. For those of you that look closely, I of course know that this is for an RC (resistor capacitor) low-pass filter, not an LC (inductor capacitor) low-pass filter, as is used in this crossover. The principals are the same.Luckily, there exist handy online calculators that will even spit out a circuit diagram for you to follow when soldering. https://www.diyaudioandvideo.com/Calculator/Speake...This website will also teach you about more complex forms of crossovers. In a nutshell, the \"order\" of the crossover determines how steeply the amplitude drops off once the cutoff frequency is reached, allowing for very distinct transitions between speakers. The \"way\" (ex. 2 way) is just the number of sections the audible frequency range is being split up. A 3-way would have a true woofer, a mid-range woofer, and a tweeter, each being full-volume for only a segment of the frequency range. There are different styles of crossovers, ours is a butterworth, and it is a 1st order, 2 way. Feel free to make circuit diagrams for other crossover types too. It is in this calculator that the impedence of the speakers you choose comes into play. Impedence is always very clearly stated in the data of a speaker along with the frequency response graph. If you choose different impedence speakers than me, or of course a different cutoff frequency, you will have different inductor/capacitor values. In terms of the power of the speaker driver, it's RMS power should certainly not be more than 30W, given the power of the amp, but does not affect the crossover. Lastly, in terms of the sensitivity of the speaker. This is related to the frequency response of course, and depends on many factors, but is essentially the volume of the speaker at a given power, i.e. how effectively it takes electrical power and delivers it into mechanical power (directly related to the amplitude, i.e. volume). The number given is usually measured with a microphone in dB, 1m away with 1W supplied to the speaker driver. This is a hugely complex topic that can't be summarized simply, but check out this link for some interesting tid-bits.http://www.psbspeakers.com/articles/Guide-to-Speak...I've added a couple extra + and - signs, and a re-drawn version of it to emphasize the nature of the circuit. See attached image. Re-creating this circuit is as easy as following the diagram and connecting the positive and negative speaker wires (as labelled on the wiring diagram that comes with the amp) from the amp to the positive and negative points in the diagram. If you haven't done many electronics before, remember that there does not need to actually be wire between connections as in the diagram, this is just to spread things out. For example, a wire can be used to connect the negatives of the tweeter and woofer, then the negative speaker wire can connect to either the negative terminal on the tweeter or the woofer, it doesn't matter since they are all at a junction together. In fact, if you do it right, you should only need 2 pieces of additional wire besides of course the speaker wires which plug into the amp board, and that's between the negative terminals on the woofer and tweeter (1 piece for each channel). The terminals on woofers are labelled, but on tweeters, they sometimes just paint the positive one red. Remember that red always means positive, and black negative.I will not go into further detail about following the circuit diagram, but I will mention a few logistics about physically soldering, and my notes about the polarity of the power connection later on.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FOR/I08B/JCAUIV4J/FORI08BJCAUIV4J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8E/NDF7/JCAUIV95/F8ENDF7JCAUIV95.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSR/C17P/JCAUIVDY/FSRC17PJCAUIVDY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWJ/OHHM/JCAUIVJR/FWJOHHMJCAUIVJR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWH/68PD/JCAUIVNC/FWH68PDJCAUIVNC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQU/V7DE/JCAUIWM9/FQUV7DEJCAUIWM9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ8/PKLD/JCAUIWSC/FJ8PKLDJCAUIWSC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHB/296W/JCAUIXXI/FHB296WJCAUIXXI.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Crossover Design"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Soldering, macro-components as you will be here, serves mostly to anchor your connection points so they won't become loose. You should be able to (and just simply should) do a \"dry run\" of your components to ensure that everything works properly before soldering it together. These are the steps you should follow for this project:1) Use sandpaper to sand off the insulative coating on the inductors, and expose the copper underneath2) Use wire strippers or otherwise expose a good chunk of the speaker wires, as well as both ends of the 2 wires used to connect the -ve terminals of the speakers give yourself lots to play with so you can form good mechanical connections prior to soldering3) Plug the power and speaker cables into the amp board following the diagram provided4) Isolate only the positive and negative wires of one channel, say left, and tape the other 2 to the table or something5) Connect via twisting (along their length), the positive speaker wire, and both the capacitor and the inductor, at one end. Ensure that if you got a polarized capacitor that the symbols line up + and -ve... normally arrows point in this direction6) Connect the other inductor end to the positive terminal of the woofer, and the capacitor to the positive end of the tweeter *NOTE, here, if you had 2 capacitors which sum to your desired total value, put them in parallel, meaning attach head to head and tail to tail, and pretend they're 1. For inductors, put them head to tail, in series. I planned to use 2 capacitors, but upon measuring mine with a multimeter, I noticed one already read very high, so the second would have only added to the error. As you can see, the capacitor I added was ~15% high, as is sometimes typical with new non-polar dielectrics, but this didn't matter. If you haven't got a multimeter, you'll just never know it was wrong.7) Connect your spare wire between the negative terminals of the woofer and tweeter8) Connect the negative speaker wire from the amp to either one of the negative speaker terminals, I chose the woofer because there was more room to pass the wire through the eyelet.FOR THE DC POWER JACK POLARITY!!!1) Look at the power supply you are using. There is an image of a ball and cup joint, with either the ball or the cup arm labelled with a - or a +. There's a 99% chance that the ball is labelled +, and this corresponds to the PIN on your power plug. This means that you want the terminal on the jack you selected which is connected to the same piece of metal that the pin will touch to be POSITIVE and the other one (which connects to the barrel) to be negative. There are 3 terminals on the jack, 1 will not be relevant to either. The one that is not like the other 2 is likely to be the terminal for the PIN. The closest of the other 2 to that terminal is likely to be for the BARREL. You should connect the positive (red) power wire to the PIN terminal, and the black (negative) power wire to the barrel (if your power supply is pin positive, which is very very likely is). Again, I used a multimeter to check the continuity between the contacts on the female end of the jack and the terminals on the back, but if you can figure it out which is which some other way then it's OK.Once that's all done, go ahead and plug in the aux-in jack, and then plug it in (carefully) and attempt to play music. If there is sound, it worked... don't worry about the quality. At this point, I should mention that as per the manufacturer instructions, if it hasn't already been removed, you should cut the ground wire on the aux-in pin that goes to the amp board since it causes interference. I believe they now remove this wire, but there is a pdf on the dayton audio website to clarify what I'm saying.THE TWEETERS PRESS FIT IN FROM THE **FRONT**, SO DO NOT SOLDER THEM UNTIL THE FRONT BAFFLE IS DONE AND THEY'RE PRESSED IN PLACEIf you're comfortable, sure-up all your connections BESIDES THE TWEETERS with solder, being careful with the tweeters, since their terminals are merely embedded in plastic wrapping, which gets soft.Lastly, test out the whole thing with the toggle switch. Luckily, if you bought an On-Off toggle switch, you've just got to make sure that the 2 adjacent terminals are connected to the on/off cable from the amp.

You've got to leave room for the speakers to at least point through, if not be mounted through the baffle. In my speaker, I \"interior\" mounted the woofers, rather than have their faceplate against the front, while the tweeters press fit in (through). The tweeters need precise holes drilled to press fit, (1.25\" is perfect), but you've got more wiggle room for the woofers. Remember, you can clean up rough EDGES of a ROUND hole, but if a hole isn't round, there's nothing you can do3. There has to be enough room for the components to fit inside, including the amp board. There should be plenty of slack in the wires. This is a simple build, but when more inductors  are involved, it's important to have then oriented in a particular fashion, but here, just make sure they're very far apart.I have provided pdfs for my plans. I made them based on measurements I took from my wood, but yours won't be far off. I won't go through how I cut the pieces, or did the rabbeting (cut corners out) of all the boards to leave a recess for the front and back to fit in.

Reproducing, recording and amplifying audio gets you up close and personal with the electrons rocketing through your circuits.Which brings us to what is in my mind the best kickoff point in learning about audio electronics - amplification. If you have access to an old speaker and an audio source (such as your phone or MP3 player) you can easily start building low cost circuits that have immediate results - music blasting into the airwaves.Chip AmpsIt used to be that audio amplification depended on large numbers of discrete components or power-hungry vacuum tubes to get decent sound from a source to a speaker. Like everywhere else, integrated circuits have made the barrier to entry much lower, letting us use any number of op-amps designed specifically for audio. These ICs are collectively called audio amplifier ICs, amplifier chips or chip amps. Typically they require few external components, can be prototyped with simple circuit designs and require less current than their discrete and tube counterparts.Which brings us to the venerable LM386 by Texas Instruments. This bad boy has been with us since 1983, and can still be found in low power, battery driven applications all around the world. And being...easy to power (using a single supply)low heat (no heatsink required)efficientavailable in the prototyping-friendly DIP package...means it's much loved by the DIY audio community and a terrific place to start experimenting with chip amps.

At least at some point. However it can, like most other basic audio amplifier chips, be used as a regular op-amp as well.It has a default gain of 20x - meaning it will multiply the voltage it receives on the input by 20 times, passing this through to the output. The gain value can be adjusted if needed.The pins1, 8 - GainPins 1 and 8 are used to adjust the gain level from the default 20x using specific values of connected capacitors.2 - Negative Input3 - Positive InputThese are the standard op-amp inputs. Typically in a simple LM386 circuit, the negative input will be tied to ground while the positive input will receive the audio signal from the source.4 - GND5 - VoutPin 5 is the op-amp output, in our case the amplified signal which we send on to the speaker.6 - VsThe Voltage Supply pin receives the power required to operate the amplifier.7 - BypassThis pin provides direct access to the signal input, primarily used to remove power supply noise (preventing noise from being amplified).SpecificationsThe LM386N (\"N\" signifying the preferred DIP package for our purposes) comes in 4 flavours: LM386N-1, -2, -3 and -4. The \"3\" and \"4\" versions have slightly higher output power, with the \"4\" version more so given its ability to handle more input voltage (at the cost of a higher minimum voltage requirement). For the rest of this article I'll refer to the LM386N-1, as it's the chip I had laying around and represents the most basic of the variants.Supply Voltage (Vcc): The chip requires a minimum of 4V to operate, with a maximum of 12V.

And in the world of headphones (where the speakers are right next to your eardrums) you're talking a couple dozen milliwatts of power needed to crank up the volume. Here's a useful, myth-busting rule to remember: Doubling output power gains you 3dB of acoustic power.Which means the difference between 50W and 100W is 3dB. The difference between 100W and 200W... 3dB. 500W and 1000W? Still only 3dB! So you hit diminishing returns pretty quickly, and get comparatively little increase in perceived volume as you go up the power scale.

The Boombox Stereo part is an amplifier and 5 1/4\" speakers that will blast out music at 98dB.This project describes the assembly of a portable solar powered AM/FM radio and digital media player equipped with Bluetooth, USB, AUX, and SD-CARD inputs.  The design is intended to be water resistant and be somewhat rugged.  The Solar Radio Boombox Stereo also features an LED courtesy light along with a digital volt meter to display battery charge level. Dual 5V USB and a 12V port round out the features making this an all round power station for charging phones and other devices.The with the exception of the solar panels everything is housed in a plastic water resistant \"ammo can\" dry box with a lockable clasp and rubber lid seal.AM/FM reception, Bluetooth, USB, SD, and AUX inputs are provided by an automotive type, marine grade, single DIN, dashboard radio head unit. The unit I choose is self contained and has 2 internal speakers of its own.  An external 16\" rubber mast antenna is attached to the rear of the unit to provide increased reception.Nothing pricey here but it does add up. I got the radio, amp, and speakers for just under $40 but the total cost of the project can go up to $200 depending on your choice of components.  I had some stuff on hand so its hard for me to say exactly what you might have to spend to make your own.Amplification is provided by a DROK 2-channel amplifier rated at 35W RMS output per channel       Speakers are 2 waterproof marine grade 5 1/4\u201d, 100W (50W RMS), 2-way mid range, and surface mounted.       Batteries are 2 12V 12Ah SLA (Sealed Lead Acid) wired in parallel to provide a total of 24Ah @ 12VDC       Charge controller is rated at 10 Amps providing charging and load protection via separate outputs.       Solar panels are 2 20W 12VDC and provide over 3 Amps at peak performance.       Home (AC) charging is provided with a \u201cwall-wart\u201d transformer rated for .5 Amps @ 14VDC (19v OCV)       Color coded LED rocker switches control radio(ACC supply), amp/fan, voltmeter, and LED courtesy light.       Cooling is provided by a 40mm variable speed fan.Whatever I didn't have I purchased on Amazon. I've included links to some equivalents of that stuff too.List of Items on AmazonGoal #1A decent radio that will play for a long long time without plugging it into the wall.This would require enough battery power to play the radio during the day while charging and enough stored power to serenade us late into the night. It should also hold up for a few cloudy days too.  This will be used for camping weekends and weather emergencies which for me would be a hurricane that could knock out the power for days or weeks.Goal #2Re-use $50 worth of batteriesI had on hand 2 big ole (almost new) SLA batteries salvaged from a dead UPS that are actually perfect for this project. Not only do they possess a lot of Amp hours but they also weigh a lot and hold the unit down. Lighter batteries might not offer that benefit. Vibration is an issue that is minimized by the mass of the batteries.  They are heavy though and I may be looking at lighter alternatives when its time to replace them.  Goal #3A repairable deviceA radio with easily replaceable parts.  If any particular component goes bad I can replace it or even upgrade without the constraints of an off the shelf system.  Goal #4A radio with good reception.A lot of times there are no bars when we go camping.  The phones don\u2019t work so no music streaming, no news, weather, or sports either. Being surrounded by a forest of 70 ft trees is nice but it can limit any unlimited plan.  You can't always count on having cell coverage to provide you with important news or entertainment. The external antenna helps pick up signals from far away even among those trees. Goal #5Weather resistant and rugged design.While a completely waterproof design was desired, in this case it is a benchmark that is hard to achieve.  There are constraints of sound amplification and battery technology that require ventilation to resolve. No SLA battery should be stored in a completely airtight enclosure due to the possibility of the battery releasing gas, which for SLA batteries is hydrogen, and other nasty stuff. Heat is one of my primary concerns and it should be noted that normal outdoor temps can exceed the recommended operating range of SLA batteries. I've made an attempt to minimize any additional heat generated by the system.Skills Needed:Electricalunderstand basic circuits Electronics Classuse and read voltmeter/multi-meter How to Use a Cheap 3$ Multimeter to Test Voltage or Amperagestrip and tin wire How to Strip and Tin Wires Like a Procrimp connections  heat shrink connections Mechanicaldetermine bolt and hole sizes       drill and debur holes       use a hole saw       use a miter saw or cut-off saw        use a jig saw or cutout tool/router        use a screw driver and wrench Designbasic math and fractions        read a ruler or tape measure        use a sliding square to mark locations        think spatiallyTools:ElectricalVoltmeter/multi-meter        Wire cutters and crimp tool        Soldering iron        Scissors (for heat shrink tubing)        Heat gun or blow dryer MechanicalPower drill and bit set        Hole saws 3/4\u201d and 1\u201d        Jig saw or cutout tool/router        Deburring tool or file set        Phillips screwdriver        Small wrench set        Utility knife        Bolt cutters (usually on crimp tool)        Hot glue gun        Miter box and miter saw or cut-off saw Design and layoutTape measure or 16\u201d ruler        Sliding square        Sharpie with ultra fine tip        Notebook MaterialsPainter\u2019s tape        Self adhesive shelf paper        Electrical tape        1/4\u201d x 2\u201d PVC molding        1/4\" wood or ABS sheet 6 1/4\" x 12 3/16\"        Stainless steel hardware        Wire ties, wire hangers, and wire loam        Sound absorbing mat (I used vent filters)        A CD or DVD (to trace speaker cutouts) Further ReadingA note on TerminologyWeather resistant doesn\u2019t mean just rain so it encompasses water resistance as well as just about anything else you could encounter outdoors like heat, cold, ice and snow, wind blown dust, and of particular concern here in Florida, humidity. So while water proof is attainable it is expensive and complicated and while it\u2019s possible this unit may take a swim it is highly unlikely. It's more likely to be used al fresco so I\u2019m going for a goal that is more robust and reasonable which is a Weather Resistant device.Love your batteriesBatteries perform better at moderate temps and over heating can not only cause the release of dangerous gases it will have a negative impact on performance and battery life.You should really think of batteries of this caliber like a pet. Most importantly the box you carry them in has to have air holes! Besides that they have to be tended to. You\u2019ve got to keep them charged and they can\u2019t get too hot or too cold.  If they are mishandled they will bite with bright white sparks. If you run them too hard they will suffer and die. Love your batteries and they will love you. Feel the heatThe electrical amplification of sound generates heat as well and can cause damage to the amplifier and other components in the system if the heat is not regulated and dissipated.  This is usually done with a heat sink that requires moving air to provide cooling to the amplifier chip(s).  In a closed case this would be a small volume of air and would not provide the desired effect without some communication with a larger volume of air outside the case.  Cooling can be provided bythe amplifier chip abutting the wall of the case and mounted to an external heat sink        a Peltier thermo-electric cooling system integrated with an external heat sink         a water cooled loop between an internal and external heat sink         a small fan and a couple of holes in the case to let some air circulate All of the options on the list except for the last are complicated and expensive. So my design has holes in the case to allow ventilation for both safety and cooling. I found a couple of places on the box where the holes are kind of protected by the shape of the box and proper placement should keep out a moderate amount of rain.  Dust can be controlled with some filter material and they can be sealed with some electrical tape. While this unit is water resistant, it is not water proof.

Known as a head unit, this one component incorporates all of the input functions required for to process digital media. AM/FM radio, Bluetooth, AUX, SD and USB are all included in one unit. It even comes with a remote. While more powerful head units are often full size (7x2x9) and require a 10 amp circuit or more, other less expensive (power sipping) units will be shorter and require less install depth. The unit in this example is only 3\u201d deep and requires less than 3 amps. It has its own speakers so if I really want to save power I can leave the amp turned off.  Like wise with the amp cranked up the radio mute button only turns off those speakers.  That's not really necessary since they actually kind of compliment each other with the smaller speakers filling in the top end.Matching The Speakers Speakers come in a variety of sizes and styles and should be matched close but above the output of your head unit or amplifier. This project isn\u2019t about speaker design and acoustics so don\u2019t expect Hi-Fi sound. I have an amp that outputs 35w on 2 channels so I\u2019m going with a pair of 5 1/4\u201d 100W (50w RMS) for around $15. Even at this low end I get about 98dB with minimal distortion.How Big is That Battery? \u201cNot big enough\u201d is the only correct answer. That being said I admit these batteries are big enough but not by design. The batteries for this build came from a UPS that is no longer with us. After the smoke cleared I was left with $50 worth of batteries and no where to put them.  This project is partly just to get some use out of almost 20 lbs of batteries. Thinking in the BoxI went with plastic instead of metal for a number of reasons. Weight, workability, price, and availability. With almost 20 pounds of batteries I don't need more weight and plastic boxes are designed to hold the same heavy loads. For workability there is no comparison and the price was fair enough at around $15. With the size of the batteries, head unit, and speakers in mind I was careful to chose a box with smooth sides and square(ish) dimensions. I didn\u2019t want to have to work around anything on or in the box. Its worth noting that some of the ridged boxes are thin walled so they require irregular shapes for strength. You may want to avoid these due to sound quality issues. This box is nice and thick, about .010 and doesn\u2019t vibrate like its another speaker. Even after checking and double checking the sizes it was hard to anticipate exactly what I was getting. I had to order online after looking in the local retail stores and not finding what I wanted. Sure enough, the dimensions were correct, but only for the middle part of the box. I hadn\u2019t noticed and a slight taper wasn't mentioned. It was enough to make me change my idea for placing the batteries.  More on that in the Layout section below. On my command \u2013 CHARGE!The solar charge controller provides a lot of neat things that are needed for a battery powered system. In addition to regulating the solar panels it also provides over load and over discharge protection. The controller will shut things off if the battery charge gets too low.  I chose one of the cheapest controllers available since it was all that is needed and its a model that is widely used.The batteries will normally be charged by the solar panels but they just need to be fed some voltage and the controller is not that particular about where it comes from as long as its within the specs.  For a backup charger I am using a scrounged up wall wart plugged into an AC outlet.  This wall wart is a \u201cClass 2\u201d transformer that says its 14 VDC which is almost enough to charge this type of battery.  This is not a PWM \u201cadapter\u201d and provides 19VDC OCV (Open Circuit Voltage) which drops to 14.2 when plugged into the controller. Just about any power adapter that outputs within the voltage and amperage range of the controller will do. Out of the many I have this one was the best suited but not the best choice to buy.  Since this controller won't buck up the voltage you should have at a minimum 14.4 volts to get an SLA battery topped off to the max.  A 12v adapter will work but only so much and should only be considered as an interim measure.  The solar panels will always provide the proper amount needed for the batteries.To modify the wall wart, the mono-plug was cut from the power lead and an SAE \u201cBullet\u201d 2-pin, quick-disconnect connector added from 1/2 of a 12\" jumper, the other half went on the solar panels.  The solar panels and the wall wart can both be connected to the unit via a single SAE, weather proof port. I chose the SAE connectors because I had some on hand and they are low cost. They work great but can be hard to disconnect. You can use whatever type connector for the power supply that is suitable for you. A Switch in TimeI had some random switches I had planned to use but I wasn't satisfied with them.  They appear in some of the earlier photos. I replaced them with the round rocker switches. They are not rated as waterproof. There are waterproof options I would probably go with if I did this over. They take too long to ship so they didn't make it in this build.Misc PartsThe standoffs protect the face of the radio and are cabinet handles from a local big box home improvement store. These handles come with mounting screws which have to be shortened to use with the thin walled box.  Use the bolt cutter on your crimp tool or thread a nut on them and grind them off.The 12V charging port is an SAE plug with a waterproof cap.  There are other options but this style of connector is compatible with a variety of 12V adapters and devices. I already have jumper cables and a cigarette light plug to charge the batteries from a running vehicle if necessary. Only do this if you know your way around your vehicle electrical system. Read your manual and don't void your warranty. The map light is a \"tag light\" with 3 LEDs with a diffused lens and covered top to direct light downward and not into your eyes.Dual USB ports provide a 2.1 Amp quick charge option and a 1 Amp port to charge or power any USB device. A 12v accessory port can charge most laptops with the right plug and also power a variety of devices.  The antenna is a 16\" rubber mast and externally mounted.All mounting hardware with exception of the standoff screws is stainless steel.  Anything less will rust sooner or later, even in the desert. Stainless steel will buy you quite a bit of time before that happens. Don't cheap out on the screws or you will regret it.

Look for defects and try all the options. Also check the compatibility of all your components. Do this part as soon as possible to make sure everything is working together okay. Try to get everything hooked up as it will be once it is installed and go through everything again. Take notes to keep track of what you're seeing and hearing. I also used a laser thermometer to check connections for heat build up at various stages of the build and after it was complete.Watch out for shorts while you're testing. I made some sparks fly by not paying attention. Insulate any bare metal on the connectors using electrical tape if you have to. Just remember its temporary. Make sure all the switches are off and hook up the battery last.I got the Bluetooth BluesI tested everything and all was fine. I even stuck the speakers in the box to get an idea of the sound. I thought everything was going to work out great but I didn't have the amp close enough to the head unit to pick up the Bluetooth interference I would notice once it was mounted.  Once the amp was mounted right next to the head unit it started hearing the Bluetooth conversation. I'm convinced this is an EMI problem as the amp worked flawlessly just a few inches away from the head unit.  It is now positioned right next to it and anytime a BT device is paired you can hear the BT signals. They seem to go away if the BT device is actually sending data (like a song), but my ears are old and your results may vary.  I don't use BT enough for it to bother me. All is not lost if that's a deal breaker.I was aware of this possible interference and actually had the amp mounted where the 12v port is on the side of the unit.  It worked fine there so I took a chance and put it where it is now.  I wanted the convenience of having the controls as close together as possible. Its too late to go back so I'm stuck with it for the time being. It's not that bad and I may be able to use some foil or a ground loop to minimize it.  I have yet to put a USB charge port in so it may end up there if I can find a new space for the amp.  If you're really into the BT you should go ahead and change your design to put the amp a little further away from the head unit or eliminate an amp altogether with a more powerful receiver.  LAYOUTI had no idea of how this would end up and approached the layout from a top down perspective.  Starting with the largest components I determined how each would fit within the space of the box.  The switches and standoffs were then placed after the big pieces were positioned.When I started I didn't have any of the parts except for the batteries and I ordered the box based on their dimensions. The published measurements made it look like this was possible but they turned out to be an average of the width and depth since the box tapers from top to bottom.  They said 6\" wide and the bottom of the box is actually 5 3/4\" while the top is larger at 6 1/8\". Same with the long side of the box. They said 12\" which turns out to be 11 7/8\" at the bottom and 12 1/4\" at the top. Luckily the batteries just fit. I wanted some air space on the ends but it should be okay. It just goes to show you can never be sure of just what you get when you order online. On that note remember to NOT use the sides of this box to draw your lines.  The sides are not square. You have to work off of the top or bottom of the box to make your measurements.The switches were placed as close to what they control as possible. The antennae went on the back towards the hinges to keep it out of the way when the lid is opened.  The charging port and map light went where there was some space left over on the end. The USB and 12v ports were placed on the back side of the unit in what little space was left. Inside I used the PVC molding to create a cradle of sorts to provide the batteries with 1/4\" air space underneath and on the side.  A additional piece of PVC on each support holds the batteries in place with the only remaining movement being straight up. This upward movement is suppressed with a 1\" x 1/2\"  bar of ABS plastic bolted to the front and rear of the box spanning the middle of the two batteries. I have yet to drill the front hole and screw it in since the back seems to hold it just fine. These batteries only last a few years so they will need to be replaced eventually. With the limited space in the box this could be tricky.  My goal for the design was to keep things out of the way so that nothing had to be removed to get the batteries out. I managed to get everything but the charging ports down on one end. Besides the charging ports wich can be unscrewed and slid out, the only thing that gets in the way is the head unit and it will slide forward enough for the battery to clear without removing it.  Just two spring clips on each side of the head unit hold it in place. The charge controller cover was removed for better cooling and it was mounted directly to the rear of the box using 6x32x1/2\" machine head screws.  The LEDs were bent up and over the top of the controller board and can be seen through the back of the box.  I cut the section off of the controller cover that held the LEDs. By slipping this over the LEDs it cuts down on light coming through the rest of the box.

If your charge controller has an on/off switch you probably don't need this. While the master switch will turn everything off and keep the controller LEDs from draining the battery, the voltmeter is wired separately and will function as long as there is a charge in the batteries. I did it like this to check the batteries without turning on anything else and to also avoid any interference from the controller.Wire colors and sizes vary because I used some I had on hand.  Normally red is the \"hot\" positive wire and black or white is the \"common\" or ground wire.  The amperage and lengths in this project don't dictate the need for really thick wires but I would not go over 16 gauge. I used 16 gauge with some heavier wire for the larger loads like the feed to controller and the terminal posts. All wire is stranded.  For outdoor use you should definitely tin your wire leads. Its kind of a hassle and merely a preference but I highly recommend it.  It's your call but make sure you have the lengths figured out first. Space is tight and extra wire gets in the way. It's no fun snipping off a tinned lead only to have to do it over.You should minimize splices and run lengths from connection to connection.  If you have to lengthen a short wire consider redoing it or altering your design first.  It's worth it to avoid that extra possible point of failure. I tried to work with what came with the parts. I was able to crimp connectors on the component wires and stick them right into a fuse or terminal without any extra lengths or splices.  If you do have to splice wires don't be tempted to solder them together. IMHO soldered connections belong only on a board. Use a (mechanical) butt connector with heat shrink tubing and don't forget to tin those wires.A lighted switch requires it own circuit.  This circuit is completed when the switch is activated and routed via a connection on the switch to the negative side of the circuit.  This means you will have an additional ground lead for every lighted switch you use.  Since I positioned each switch close to the device it controls I was able to piggyback the ground lead from the device to the connector on the switch and run a single negative wire back to the terminal post.Fuses come first.  DC power flows down the positive lead.  Get the fuse as close to the source as possible before any switches and components.  A fuse on your negative lead will only blow after a surge goes trough everything else in the circuit!  Fuses should be matched to the power requirements of the circuit and as close to but above that rating.Use a little tough Love!  Once you crimp your connections you should really yank on them to make sure they are tight. If they come out you are not doing something right. Check your sizes. Connectors are color coded for the wire size you should use.  Also make sure the color codes on the connector and crimp tool match up.  Make sure you line up the connector and are pressing the top of the crimp down on the top of the connector then really squeeze it hard.  Stand on it if you have too.  Use short lengths of pipe to extend the handles for better leverage if all else fails or if you broke your leg standing on your crimp tool. As a rule of thumb (and most of my fingers)Safety Third! As long as its first and second that is. Don't think this stuff is harmless. It can burn you or start a fire. While you are working on this don't leave things unattended without unhooking the battery power first.  Make sure to keep your batteries safe from anything falling on the terminals. Tape works.  Call me paranoid but I usually unplug things like soldering irons too just to make sure they are off even if they already are. P.S. As of this writing I still have all of my fingers except for the tip of one thumb lost a long long time ago to an errant utility knife.

You need a pilot hole for each speaker and the head unit. The pilot hole should be large enough for the jigsaw blade to fit into. Make your cut outs for the speakers and the head unit. Save the material you cut away. I used these scraps to test different glue and make washers and spacers. Each switch requires a 3/4\" hole. Use the scrap from these holes for the standoff washers. If you use a paddle bit you will have to fabricate the washers from your scrap pieces. Drill the holes for the standoffs on 3\" centers. The clearance holes for the standoffs should be tight so pick a drill bit as close to the bolt size as possible. I cleaned up the scraps from the 3/4\" hole saw and used them to add some meat to the sidewall of the box. The screws they came with have broad heads which should cover the pilot hole made by the hole saw.The antenna requires a 3/4\" hole. I put it on the back 1 1/4\" from the top and side. I positioned it toward the side of the box with the hinges.The power port also requires a 3/4\" hole for the wires to pass through.  Center this hole 1 1/4\" from the edge and the same distance down from the hinge support.  Once this hole is drilled insert the port and mark the 4 mounting holes. The clearance hole for these can be a little loose since there are 4 and hard to get lined up.Do the same thing for the map light. To get get it straight trace a line across the side at the proper height using your sliding square. Measure across to find the center of the light once its mounted. Mark that spot and drill the center hole for the wires. Then insert the lamp and get the 2 mounting holes lined up on your marked line. Mark the locations, remove the lamp, and drill the holes.The amp volume knob requires a 3/8\" hole with a small key slot to hold it place.The voltmeter, USB ports, and 12v port barrels require a 1 1/16\" hole for mounting. I was able to use a 1\" hole saw and carved a little with a utility knife and sanded the holes to fit. You only have to take off a 1/32\" all the way around or just the top and bottom to get a tight fit since the sides of the barrels are flattened.  The charge ports have a face plate which is optional but adds some stability to the mount points of the ports. Once you get the ports drilled hand tighten the barrels with the face plate on. Line up the face plate and drill the holes for the mounting screws. I used #6 x 1/2\" machine head bolts instead of the self tapping crews that came with the unit. The antenna and round rocker switches require a 3/4\" hole for mounting and the switches have a key lock that requires a small notch on the side of the hole to keep the switch from rotating. Use a small square file or your utility knife to make the notch.Make sure to clean up the plastic shavings.  They are not biodegradable and should be disposed of properly (or re-used improperly) Just don't let that stuff get spread around there's enough out there already.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F3A/LBWT/J5MQ9H35/F3ALBWTJ5MQ9H35.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDW/O1BO/J5MQ9H3P/FDWO1BOJ5MQ9H3P.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN3/PEQL/J5MQ9H49/FN3PEQLJ5MQ9H49.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F88/PFBM/J5SFVHST/F88PFBMJ5SFVHST.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Cut Outs and Though Holes"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "I didn't use any caulk or glue on the mounted components.  I did it this way so that things can be removed and or replaced easily.  Most surfaces match up and seal pretty good already so it would be overkill.I had planned to glue PVC strips to the inside sides of the box to mount things to but nothing really sticks that well to this plastic. I had the best results with hot glue and used that for the battery cradle. While it holds pretty well I didn't trust it enough to hang the components from.  The head unit has a metal sleeve that slides into the cutout.  Metal tabs on the sleeve are bent behind the box wall to hold the sleeve into place. The head unit slides into the sleeve and is held in by a spring tab on each side.The speakers were mounted with the included hardware which is meant for use in a blind install where you cant reach around the back of the speaker.  Since I can reach the back I used these like spring clips with both sides behind the mounting surface.  I didn't have any foam to use for a gasket but if you do take the time to cut out a ring to go in between both speakers and the box.The amplifier just hangs from the potentiometer (volume knob) which is bolted to the box. There was no other choice without being able to glue a mounting block for it. This should be okay for such a light unit. Time will tell.  The 12V solar charging port (supply) is attached to the side using #6 x 1/2\" stainless steel machine screws.The USB and 12v charge ports were mounted on the back of the unit with the switch above it just below the fan speed controller. The standoffs are cabinet handles mounted with the supplied screws and backed up with washers made from left over material from the cutouts.I fabricated a set of terminal posts on a strip of PVC.  I used brass screws and gnarled nuts for binding the connectors. The PVC strip was later mounted to the side of the box using one of the mounting screws for the lamp.Top It All OffThe primary purpose of the top panel is for space to mount things to but it also keeps the interior closed off when the lid is opened. You may or may not need this part depending on how you mount your components.For the top panel I used a 1/4\" ABS plastic sheet cut to fit the opening.  I got this from a friend who had it left over from a project.  I'm not sure where he got it from. If you cant get ABS use plywood or a thin board. I cut the panel to size on a table saw to get nice clean edges. A through hole was drilled to mount the master switch which was placed to clear the top of the lid when its closed.For the fan I made brackets out of two metal strips that came with the radio. They are intended for removing it from a blind install and since I can reach the back of the radio I don't need these. I drilled holes on the ends of each strip and bent them around the fan frame with tabs sticking out to mount it to the underside of the top panel. To mount the brackets I drilled shallow pilot holes and used small 1/4\" long self tapping screws offset with washers to keep them from poking out the other side.Once my new batch of switches arrive I will mount the fan switch next to the master switch and bolt the speed controller to the bottom of the panel with the knob sticking though so adjustments can be made without lifting the panel.  Unlike the box material the ABS takes to the glue well so the cooling fan will remain glued to the panel.Update: For turning the fan on and off I used a switch I salvaged from the dead UPS. I used my utility knife and pretty much carved out  5/16\" pilot holes to get the 1\" x 7/16\" rectangle shape required for the switch. It was a pain but the switch was free. I put the fan switch here because I won't be using it that often. Once its on it will stay on and vice versa. The fan doesn't pull that much power at full speed (.07A) and the controller isn't necessary.  I just had it laying around and put it in for even more for extended range. If you think it will always be hot (or cold) when and where you are using this go ahead and skip the controller and get a 2 wire fan around the same rating.I drilled a 3/8\" hole for the fan speed controller knob and mounted the fan speed controller board under the panel. I used plastic brackets leftover from installing window blinds.  I cut off some of the excess plastic and used the offset to clear the screw heads in the tight space where the board was mounted.  Again I used short screws with washers to keep them from going through. I also sleeved the fan wires to keep them in order and added plugs to the power leads so the lid can be completely removed.  The plugs should be wired so the the receptacle is on the \"hot\" side coming from the terminal posts.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FR7/MEDO/J5MQEK76/FR7MEDOJ5MQEK76.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW9/GSS9/J5MQEK6L/FW9GSS9J5MQEK6L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN4/STM1/J5MQEK6M/FN4STM1J5MQEK6M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6T/6YNS/J5MQEK6J/F6T6YNSJ5MQEK6J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F97/1HNN/J5SE19MO/F971HNNJ5SE19MO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV5/26LI/J5SFVUR5/FV526LIJ5SFVUR5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1J/COMU/J6FYUTPX/F1JCOMUJ6FYUTPX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FT2/OPMJ/J6FYUTHP/FT2OPMJJ6FYUTHP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2W/359T/J6WGR9IE/F2W359TJ6WGR9IE.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Mounting Components"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Final TouchesThe amplifier is really great but it came with a cheap plastic knob. I found another one that fit the 1/4\" shaft.  Its aluminum and has a set screw to hold it on. Looks better too.I used some 6\" x 12\" vent filters for some sound deadening. If they can hold up in a heater vent they will hold up in the box.  I used about 4 of these between the speakers and the batteries and used electrical tape to secure them to the wall of the box under the head unit. This loose weave material offers some improvement but not much, feel free to pursue your own strategy to fit whatever you have on hand. I would avoid foam rubber or anything flammable. I started the wire management but ran out of hangers for the wire ties.  They are the only thing that seems to stick to the box walls.  It does help to keep things tidy but as long as nothing is touching the wrong thing it should all be fine for now.  I did tape all of the switches, the battery posts, and all other bare metal connectors except for the terminal posts.I used a piece of Velcro on the back of the remote to hold it in place on the top panel where it will sit with the lid closed.  I put hinges on the solar panels so they fold up. I wired them together and added the SAE plug from the other half of the 12\" cable.  I used a pair of self adhesive wall hangers on the back of one of the panels for a place to wrap the 25' extension cable when not in use.I put a ribbon on the antenna to make it a little more visible and give me an idea of which way the wind is blowing. The ventilation in the box flows from right to left and a breeze from the wrong direction might counteract the circulation efforts of the cooling fan.  AftermathThe unit sounds great to me for what it is.  There's no sub woofer so it lacks any real oomph but the 5 1/4\" speakers sound as well as any installed in a car door.  If I had to be critical of anything I would say the low end is a little muddy.  It's not that bad and by being able to adjust the volume on both units you can really change the sound to your preference.  The head unit by itself is not much to listen too but its bearable and with such a low power draw should it play forever even with very little sunshine.  I have field tested the Solar Radio Boombox Stereo and it performed better than expected. On a 3 day camping weekend it charged while we listened to it on the first day and it played for hours into the night. The next day was cloudy and I didn't even hook up the panels. It played most of the day and into the night. The third day, 36 hours after the last charge, the battery was still at 12.4 volts. Now I didn't really blast it but it was loud enough to drown out distant distractions like loud 4 wheelers and airboats.    The temperatures averaged in the mid 90's with a heat index around 100 F. It was hot and the radio was outside the whole time. Its really hard on the batteries at these temps so the cooling fan is critical to keep things as cool as possible. If its really hot you may not be able to charge at all during the middle of the day without boiling the batteries.     RegretsI would replace the solar charge controller with one that has a temperature sensor.  This allows the controller to adjust the charge voltage downward when its hot or crank it up when its cold. I need to add a ground loop to the stereo amplifier power supply and or get it further away from the head unit BT chip.I would use soundproofing on the inside walls of the box. I would use switches specifically rated as waterproof.I would add a signal amplifier on the radio antenna. (Couldn't find a good one that works)Maybe a sub-woofer?Besides all that I would do it again the exact same way.  It was a very enjoyable project and I'm looking forward to always having some decent tunes no matter where I go.Questions, comments, and critiques welcome.   Thanks for Reading.

Since we are making a sealed enclosure we only care about the sealed enclosure volume of our specific driver. In this case it is about 1 cubic foot of space*.\u00a0\nBecause we have a complex shape for our sub enclosure, how do we determine the volume of the enclosure? A simple way to calculate volume for an\u00a0irregularly\u00a0shaped enclosure is to create a similar enclosure of a known volume (eg a rectangle) and fill it with packing peanuts, sand, or anything else that will fill the volume and is easy to manage. Fill the container of known volume then pour the contents into your fiberglass enclosure. Mark the leven that the material reaches in your enclosure with a sharpie. This is the volume your enclosure should be.\u00a0\n*Dont forget to account for the volume of your sub and any support bracing etc that will be taking up \"volume\" inside the enclosure as this will count against the total volume.\nUse a dremel or similar cutting tool to cut your enclosure at the predefined dimensions.

In this step you will be setting the front facing shape that will create the\u00a0visible\u00a0portion of the sub enclosure.\nTheir are a few ways to do this, you can\u00a0certainly\u00a0get creative here as to where you want the sub positioned and what direction it should face. Here is how I did mine.\nYou need to cut out a ring of wood for the sub to mount onto. This MUST be wood and not fiberglass as fiberglass will crack and not seal\u00a0properly. If you have a jig saw or a similar tool you can easily mark and cut out the ring shape from 1/2\" or 3/4\" MDF. Since you will only need about a 1 foot piece it is likely you can buy a scrap piece from the store.\u00a0\nThe speaker mounting ring must be mounted to the sub enclosure in such a way that it can withstand the pressure of layering the fiberglass in the next steps but also be removable when they are complete. To do this I picked up a cheap dowel and cut it into 4 pieces. I used Hot Glue to create a sort of tripod support system that held the ring in the proper 3D location.\nNext grab an old t-shirt or buy a yard of cotton fabric and stretch it over the face of the enclosure. If you need to, make\u00a0adjustments\u00a0to the speaker ring until you are happy with the shape of the subwoofer.\u00a0\nAgain, use hot glue to attach the cotton material to the outside edges of the enclosure and trim off the excess. Now is a good time to test fit the enclosure so that you have a good idea of what the finished product will look like. If you dont like how it looks then cut off the cotton, reposition the speaker ring and try again.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FV0/6MJS/H0OJ215Q/FV06MJSH0OJ215Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAO/D3U1/H11WJ9AQ/FAOD3U1H11WJ9AQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUC/2YTK/H0OIVG4V/FUC2YTKH0OIVG4V.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Create the Front Shape"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "After you have added the stretched cotton material over the front of the enclosure you want to build up a thick layer of fiberglass to complete the enclosure. The front is very delicate at this point as it is only supported by a few dowels and hot glue.\u00a0\nTo give your self a sold area to work with you are going to coat the cotton with resin. Use a brush and make sure the cotton is fully saturated with resin. It is not necessary to use resin beyond the inside of the speaker ring as you will be cutting into this area later and it will just make things more difficult.\nOnce the cotton has fully dried you can start layering fiberglass like you did previously. Remember to go beyond the edges of the front and press the mat down with a roller to seal the edges.

We want the sub to look like it was OEM installed and not an add on.\u00a0\nDrive your car down to an auto store, craft store, or car shop and find some automotive fabric that matches your existing trunk fabric. Usually trunks are black or a shade of gray so it isnt very hard to get a close color.\u00a0\nI used 3M super 77 spray glue to glue the fabric to the fiberglass surface. Do yourself a favor and buy the good stuff or you will be re spraying this later. 3M 77 is good to have on hand anyway.\u00a0\nSpray both the back of the fabric and the fiberglass. Its ok to use too much glue in this case. Start laying the fabric in the center and use your (clean) roller to stretch and press the fabric over the curved surface. Sometimes a heat gun or hair dryer can help mold the fabric to curved surfaces easier. Make sure to go beyond the front edges so they dont peal up easily. When the glue is dry cut an X into the center of the sub mounting hole. Trim the carpeting so that it extends to the inside of the mounting ring. Use additional glue if needed.\u00a0\nWhen you are done you can mount the subwoofer. Depending on how flat of a sufrace you have to mount your sub to you may need additional sealing tape. Use a foam tape or weather sealing tape along the edge of the speaker cutout to seal any gaps. Pre-drill your holes and use wood screws, NOT drywall screws.\nOnce your enclosure is together put it in your trunk and try it out. If this is a new sub make sure to break in your sub properly and gradually increase the volume over time. You will want to check the enclosure for leaks or rattles as well as make sure the sub is tightly screwed in place.

The Audio input to amplifier is shown very well in the seconded picture, the mono channel plug has 2 wires one for ground and the other for left and right signal. Since I have only built one speaker I had to combine the left and right signals, however; if you were to make two of these speakers you would want to change out this cable two one where the left and right channels are separated. I also made the chord itself, if you extend the black and red wires with 18 gauge speaker wire you can take the braided wrap of paracord and cover the speaker cable. as shown in the cover photo.2.     To get the power to the board we have to add a DC female jack, this is shown in the 3rd picture. One note here is to make sure you solder the correct wires to the positive and negative terminals of the jack, otherwise you could burn up the amp. The best way to do this is plug the power supply and check which one of the 3 pins are +12V GND and +6V. You want to solder wires to the +12V and GND.3.     In the 7th picture you can see OUT + & - , solder wires to those and that goes to the input of the crossover using the 18 gauge speaker wire.4.     The crossover separates the frequencies at 2500Hz. Basically what this means is that out of the spectrum that the human ear can hear 35Hz-2500Hz play from the subwoofer and 2500Hz-20,000Hz plays from the tweeter. This point was determined by looking at the spec sheet of each speaker and seeing where it starts to drop off in quality and the overlap with the other speaker in the system.

So the dimensions of the entire build is very odd and it wouldn't make sense to try and recreate my cabinet precisely. Nonetheless I will still show you how I made it. One important note is that the inner volume is 1/4 ft^3. The first thing I did was cut the maple to make the sides of the box, all I used to hold it together are some brad nails. I also used a bit of silicon along the edges to make sure the box is air tight except for the port hole that I would add later. After I did that I ran into my first design problem, I have to have access to the box so the back oak panel has to come off.To solve this issue I cut some small trim pieces to use as a lip to hold the vinyl tubing. I am using the vinyl tubing as a gasket to keep the box as air tight as possible. This creates a airtight seal around the edge when the piece of oak is pressed against it. Next I had to come up with a way for the oak board to put enough pressure on the vinyl tubing. To do that I added two blocks with a hole drilled through and a nut on the other side that has been pressed into the wood so it cannot rotate. The 4in machine screws go through the oak piece then into the block till they reach the nut, this is how the oak piece stays on.Next we have to add the port hole first I traced the outer and inner circles on the oak board then i broke the plastic pieces of the port so it would fit into the hole.

There are hundreds of options which can make it difficult to find what you are looking for.  Here are some basic tips to help you decide.Price range: there are lots of options in the $10-20 range which I think are perfect for portable/bluetooth audio.  Since you will be limited in terms of output by the amplifier (typically 10-50W per channel), there's no reason to spend upwards of $100 on a driver which can handle high power. Speaker Sensitivity: this parameter is very important when designing portable speakers since it's a measure of how loud the speaker can get with 1 watt of power @ 1 meter. Since the speaker is battery powered, you want to use as little power as possible.  As a good rule of thumb, drivers with a sensitivity of 87 dB @ 2.83V/1m and higher are considered efficient drivers.  At this rating, the speaker would produce over 100 dB with only 20W...which is quite loud!Frequency response: the main reason why I chose the Dayton speaker above is due to it's low price, high sensitivity, and extended frequency response.  This driver has a frequency response of 80 - 20,000 Hz, which means it is a true full range speaker. I wanted to avoid the complexity and cost of adding a tweeter and crossover network so this speaker fit the bill.There are many other parameters that need to be considered when selecting speakers and designing the enclosure.  The tips above are just that...tips. If you'd like to learn more about Thiele/Small Parameters and how you can use them to help achieve better results, here are some useful links:https://www.eminence.com/support/understanding-lou...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiele/Small_paramet...In order to make use of these parameters, simulation software is usually required.  For Windows users, WinISD is a good option.  For Mac users, the options are limited...http://www.linearteam.org/http://www.midwestaudioclub.com/resources/winisd-a...For reference, I have included the simulation I generated which helped me decide on enclosure & port size. My priority was to extend the low frequency response without sacrificing SPL so I chose to tune the box to 85Hz, close to the speaker's resonant frequency (Fs).  This configuration creates a +3dB peak at ~130Hz which gives this speaker a nice and punchy low end (read: not deep bass). It is possible to tune to a lower frequency but with this driver, it will result in diminished sound pressure levels.

I used a circular saw and some hardwood as a guide...so if you don't have access to a table saw, don't fret! I used a 3\" fofstner drill bit to create the speaker openings.  I then used a 1/2\" rabbeting bit and a router table to create a rabbet around the perimeter of the opening.  I set the depth of the rabbet to equal the linear excursion of the speaker + the depth of the speaker flange + a couple of millimeters as a safety factor.  This allows for the speakers to mount flush and never extend past the front face -- critical for hiding the speaker behind fabric.I then cut the pine board into two 7.5\" long pieces and one 16\" long piece. I then bore a hole in each of the side pieces in order to mount the 4\" ports. I used a drill press and forstner bit for these as well.

I also drilled the LED and DC jack holes in a small strip of walnut which I will use to fill in the channel that I previously created in the rear baffle.

I stretched the fabric around the speaker and stapled it in place. This was honestly one of the most difficult tasks since I have never worked with fabric before and it was quite difficult to keep the fabric stretched and aligned while trying to staple it.  If anyone has tips on this feel free to post in the comments section!! After stapling the fabric, I mounted the LED strip in the rear. I used caulking to seal the top piece and then used pocket hole screws to fasten it to the enclosure.  I pre-drilled 4 holes to the bottom piece and used wood screws to fasten it to the enclosure.  I covered the screws with some rubberized feet. That's it! When the DC jack is unplugged, the speaker is powered via the batteries.  When the DC power supply is plugged in, the batteries are charged and playback is unaffected!

Since all radios are different you need to figure out exactly what your radio has inside. you can do this by either looking directly at the capacitors and hopefully the numbers will be still visible. You can also look at the service manual for a schematic for your radio. you can get one here:\u00a0http://www.nostalgiaair.org/\u00a0If they have a schematic for your radio, it will be like mine and list specifically every capacitor and resistor value and any other bit of info about your radio. mine even tells me how to calibrate the AM and FM which would seem impossible without the manual. The manual also show component locations to help you locate the parts.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Next, get a piece of paper to write down the values and voltages you need. I also wrote down conversions from microfarads to picofarads to help when i go to select the new ones. from what ive done research on and what the great people on this website have told me, the paper and wax capacitors are the ones that need to be changed, which is underneath the chassis. As far as the humming noise goes. that is the electrolytic capacitors in the power supply circuit, mine was located in a metal can on the top of the chassis which contains 3 capacitors inside it actually.\u00a0 \u00a0 Make sure the radio is unplugged before you go poking at things! on most chassis, the metal case is the negative part. but while you're in there, look around and see if there is any burnt out parts or wires that need attention.\u00a0", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FBN/LTEP/GW88OX6V/FBNLTEPGW88OX6V.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRW/87DW/GW88OX6R/FRW87DWGW88OX6R.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Inventory the Caps to Be Replaced"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "\u00a0 I originally thought this would be a fun part of the restoration project, but I was wrong. I say that because there is alot of things you have to be careful of as you chose the new caps. mainly the voltage ratings, polarity, and values. I was sweating up a storm and doing lots of conversions to get what i needed. the selection wasnt good as i hoped but its the best around besides the internet. i bought my supplies at FRY's electronics in Las Vegas.\u00a0 \u00a0 If you replace a cap that has a lower voltage rating than what is called for, you will come to know its wrong as the radio powers up and you hear the caps explode! so be careful and write down what the voltage ratings are. you can always go above the rated voltage but NEVER lower. a capacitor will only take in the voltage its given. example: if the rating for a cap you need is 100v, you can get a 150v, 250, etc. and it will work the exact same as a 100v.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Polarity is also something to look out for, especially in polarized electrolytic caps. these are the ones cylindrical in shape and have a black stripe on one side. if these are installed backwards, it will also explode! \u00a0the power supply caps i used to replace the can caps are the only polarized caps i used in this whole restore. \u00a0 Keep in mind though that there are non polarized electrolytic caps out there too. they look really similar in appearance but dont have a strip on them and the box they come in says non polarized. you can install these in any position. polarity doesnt matter and they wont explode if the voltage value is where it needs to be.\u00a0 \u00a0 Values are important in the fact that the radio wont work correctly. these values are listed in microfards on the old paper and wax caps but are abbreviated \"MFD\". when buying new caps, you can buy ones in picofarads too if you do the conversions for them. it is the same capacitance if you did it right. thats why i wrote it in different values for the same cap on the paper. you can look up a conversion table on google. on my radio parts list in the manual online, it says i can go +/- 20% which means i can go 20% below or 20% above the rated value and it will still work the same. older radios arent so specific i guess.\u00a0 \u00a0 When youre at the store or online buying these things and youre like me and cant find half of the value and voltages you need, dont freak out. with capacitors you can parallel them and put them in a series to get the value you need. say if you need a 20mfd cap 250v, you can get two 10mfd 250v caps to get the 20mfd value you need. keep the voltages the same if possible or higher. just because they are in parallel the voltages is only as good as the lowest one. i didnt need to put any in a series to get a value i needed but if you need to the option is there.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0one last thing, a good thing about capacitors, it more or less doesnt matter what type of cap you use as long as its value and voltage is what you need. I used polarized electrolytic in the power supply because thats what it originally had, and i mostly used ceramic and mylar caps for the rest of it simply because the ceramic caps handles alot of voltage when others dont. i used non polarized electrolytic ones where i could too.\u00a0 \u00a0 i also purchased a decent soldering iron and solder while i was there. those battery powered cold heat ones dont seem to work for this project.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FHK/5GMC/GW88OXII/FHK5GMCGW88OXII.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Purchase Your New Parts!"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "\u00a0 Now that you purchased all the parts you need to replace we can begin the cutting out of the old capacitors. just grab and pair of wire snips and dig in... NOT!! you should do one at a time. just because you have the schematic doesnt mean if you cut them all out at once you will stand a chance of knowing where even one goes much less the value thats supposed to be there. start simple and easy. \u00a0 not me though, i started with the hardest ones i could, those being the power supply circuit caps in the metal can. three of them in that thing. not the same value either. on the side of the can it has symbols and values next to the symbols. underneath the can next to the wire post should be a symbol matching one on the side so you know what cap goes to which wire. sadly... not in my case. there is symbols on the can as you can see in the picture but no symbols underneath. in my can there is 20, 20, 40 mfd 250v caps inside. funny and true story, i spent an hour at the store looking for just these values that they didnt even have. they didnt even have the values i could parallel or series them to work. i did however find 47mfd 250v caps there. so now i had one cap that would work within 20% i could use. but inpatient me, i got to the point where i just said screw it and i got three 47mfd caps for the power supply. i read that if the capacitance is too low the radio will hum which is why it was doing that in the first place because the old ones dried out. and if the capacitance is too high, more power will flow through the circuit which is also not good.\u00a0 \u00a0 i desoldered one wire of a post and soldered it onto the positive leg of the new cap (keeping in mind the polarity) and did that for all three now that they are the same value. then i soldered the negative legs of all three together and soldered those to a wire which was then soldered to the chassis (chassis being the negative). \u00a0the metal can is a negative common for the old caps inside\u00a0 \u00a0 you should always power up your radio after each cap you do to make sure its working properly and not going to explode etc... when i did this i didnt hear any noise or hum come from the speaker like i usually do. so i turned the volume up and all i heard was crystal clear audio! no hum whatsoever! i fixed it! my gamble with those caps paid off. no issues at all. sweet!\u00a0 \u00a0 once these are soldered, make sure they are secure and wont contact the chassis or other components. once again, be careful when testing it after each new cap, there is DC voltage in here when powered up. i measured it at 142vdc in some spots and anywhere above and below that in certain places.

(makes it easier to relocate if you forget and and also easier to solder). i double checked the value on the old wax cap to match up my new one. i then twisted each new cap leg around the old lead and soldered it on. these are non polarized so it dont matter which way its put in.\u00a0 \u00a0 as you can see in the picture i paralleled a couple of ceramic caps to get the value i needed. there is also some original ceramic capacitors in here, and im told they dont need changing unless they are broken or burnt. why did they not put ceramics everywhere instead of those wax and paper ones? feel free to comment on this i would like to know! \u00a0 I just kept moving one capacitor at a time working my way through each section and then finished on the other side of the radio on the am/fm circuit caps. there is also some RF chokes and transformers in here, it would be a good idea to ohm these out with a multi meter to make sure they dont have an open connection somewhere. check wires too, as you can see in the picture they are the fabric covered kind that could short against the chassis if a hole is rubbed in it. mine checked out great and the material is still really strong.\u00a0", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FV4/EZBC/GW898DEG/FV4EZBCGW898DEG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOO/S6TQ/GW88OXSD/FOOS6TQGW88OXSD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSI/Q1UQ/GW88LEBX/FSIQ1UQGW88LEBX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2B/6LTG/GW88UDLL/F2B6LTGGW88UDLL.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Snip Snip Here We Go!"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "\u00a0 I did some research on my tubes in the radio. i noticed a couple of tubes had a very weak heater in them. one tube has 3 heaters in it actually, and another one has 2, while the rest of them have just 1. the tube with the 3 heaters in it is the 6T8A tube. this one from what i read is the AM/FM detector and amplifier tube. this tube does three different things, and it had a very weak heater (or i should say 3 weak heaters). and the tube with 2 heaters in it is the 12AT7 tube which is an FM detector or sorts, it had only one heater lit and the other was dead. all others were glowing a bright orange.\u00a0 \u00a0 there is an antique store in vegas that i recalled going to that had a huge basket of old radio tubes in it. i went there and spent probably 2 hours going through all the tubes looking for some replacements for my radio and i actually found every kind except the 12AT7.some tubes looked brand new. \u00a0i did some research before i left to see if i could substitute different ratings for the original and discovered a couple they had there would work in place of the 12AT7. so i got one 12AX7 and a 12AU7 which the AX has a slightly higher gain than the AT, and the AU has a lower gain than the AT. so i got one higher and one lower. the gain just makes it sound a little different i read online.\u00a0 \u00a0I took my \"new to me\" tubes and went to buy them. there was 6 tubes i wanted and i talked to the lady who works there and got the price down to $10 for the 6 tubes. which in my research wasnt bad at all for all them compared to buying them online. i priced them on ebay later and a couple of them were going for $10 each while others were around $2 on average. buying those 6 tubes off ebay including shipping would have cost me almost $60. so it really does save money to do your research. plus i didnt have to wait to get them!\u00a0 \u00a0 i came home and plugged them in, and all of them work great, as far as all the heaters lighting up brightly, but the radio didnt act any different or sound any better by me doing this. on the bright side i got some spare tubes for the radio. \u00a0 it still has no FM band, for the fact that i did look up other radios on the internet of the same exact brand and model and their FM worked, so i know i missed something, but its no big deal. i came up with a better solution to the problem.

Remember, this is where the negative wire from the power is connected.  There are usually a heap of different negative points on the board however so if you are having trouble soldering onto this pint, just follow the traces on the circuit board from the negative point and use a different negative solder point.3.

Push the button on the front.   My soldering skills being what they are, I enclosed the connection with a dab of hot glue to hopefully add some strength.  If I were to do it over again, I would have gone with a Bluetooth module instead of an already manufactured unit.  Learning moment.If that is a stumbling block, you could always mount the Bluetooth receiver on the exterior.  For the battery, I simply glued in extra wood to make a holder and used wire to hold in place.  If you look at one of the battery supports, you will see 2 bolts.  These are the power rails.  1 for positive, 1 for negative.  There are many different ways to do this including just twisting all the wire together with wire nuts (I would not recommend).For the smaller components, I just applied a bit of hot glue to hold them in place. For the battery charger, I made a short cord from the power connector to a female plug and plugged the battery charger into that.For the 12v to 5 module, ran 12v from the battery (via switch) to the module, then plugged the Bluetooth into the usb output.The basic wiring goes something like this:Speakers, left and right to the left and right terminals on the amp.  I tinned these because it's the anal thing to do.With the exception of the battery charger, all the electrical components are wired to the bolts.

In such a situation you would plug in your earphones, raise the volume, just relax and listen to music. But what about others? Speakers can be a better and healthier option to listen together. But the problem comes when you have to carry those large, bulky speakers in your suitcase or backpack which should not be a good idea. They are expensive and need to be plugged to an external power supply which is not available everywhere. Portable speakers can be a better option but they are too expensive and some of them do not have that loud and clear sound. Why don't make your own portable- battery operated and solar powered speakers that has sound much louder and better quality than normal portable speakers? This instructable will guide you the same thing.The project consists of two amplifier circuits each connected to an 8ohm, 1watt speakers. The amplifier circuit has LM386 IC which known for its less price and good sound. The speaker has an aux input which can be connected to any audio device (such as your iPod, mp3 player, tablet, phone or a DVD player). It also has a volume control feature for each speaker controlled using a potentiometer (or variable resistor) for each. The speakers are battery operated which can last for greater than one day for an 8v, 1.0ah battery pack. Since, the power consumed by the project is less, it can also be powered using a solar panel in bright sunlight (see step 18). The sound produced by the speaker is louder and clearer even than what you expect! It can also be used to watch movies with your friends using a phone or tablet attached to it and kept on a clamp as the speaker of your phone or tablet is not capable to produce a loud sound (see step 19). The materials used to make it are simple like cardboard, tape, paints etc. and no power tools are required to make it which makes it a good weekend project and to get started with electronics.If you have any question related to this instructable or found an error, feel free to comment or ask a question.Please vote for me in all the contests by clicking the orange icon on the top right corner of the page if you like this instructable.Here is a video of the project in action: Some features of this portable speaker:Has a loud sound. If you tune the pots at maximum volume, the sound will fill up your entire house.  Has a clear sound unlike some speakers that have that 'hum' or shrillness in voice which is very unpleasant to hear when they are tuned to full volume.  Is cheap and easy to make. The cost of the project is $4-5 as it uses simple materials like cardboard, paints, tape etc. to make it. The entire enclosure of the project is made using cardboard which is easy to assemble.  Is battery operated (and also solar operated) which makes is portable. You need not necessarily plug it to an external power supply.  Can easily fit in your suitcase or backpack. The speaker and enclosure are small in size and lightweight as not heavy components are added inside. Both the speakers are not separated and connected to each other with cables which makes it easy to handle and accommodate in your suitcase.  Can be used to hear music, watch movies and even play games.  Has an aux input jack which makes it connecting to audio devices easily using an aux cable.  Is multi-purpose.

Since the output of any audio device is not enough that it can drive a speaker loudly which can spread the sound throughout your room. The output signals are just enough to power a speaker that can produce a sound equivalent to that of an earphone. But to produce a loud sound, you need a device connected to your speaker called an 'amplifier.' As the name tells, it amplifies or strengthens audio signals so that they become powerful enough to drive a speaker loudly. You may have seen big amplifiers used to power big speakers in parties or your audio system. But there are amplifiers in small portable speakers as well like this one.The amplifiers circuit here consists of an LM386 used to make small and cheap amplifiers with some external components attached to it. This circuit was the best one in dozens of LM386 circuits that I found throughout the web. The role of external components here is to filter the audio signals and remove any harshness or hum. They also help the chip to be used in a better way. Since there are two speakers used in the project, you need to make two separate such circuits, one for each of the speakers.The reason why you should need to prototype the circuit before soldering it is to check whether the circuit works properly, to correct any errors or to make any modifications. Connect everything according to the breadboard layout given above. Power it using a 9v battery and connect the audio jack to your cellphone or any other audio device.

The notch filter is used to remove noise at 60Hz because an ECG signal does not contain signals at 60Hz. Finally the low-pass filter removes higher frequencies to remove noise from the signal and in combination with the notch filter only allows in the frequencies that are represented in an ECG signal.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: Determine What Filters and Amplifiers to Use"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The amplifier is required to have a gain of 1000 V/V and as it can be seen, the amplifier is made up of two stages. Therefore, the gain must be distributed evenly among the two stages, with K1 being the gain of the first stage and K2 being the gain of the second stage. We determined K1 to be 40 and K2 to be 25. These are acceptable values due to the fact that when multiplied together, a gain of 1000 V/V is obtained, 40 x 25 = 1000, and they are of comparable amount, with a variance of 15 V/V. Using these values for the gain, the proper resistances can then be computed. The following equations are used for these calculations:Stage 1 Gain: K1 = 1 + 2R2R1 (1) Stage 2 Gain: K2 = -R4R3 (2) We arbitrarily picked a value of R1, in this case it was 1 k\u2126, and then subsequently solved for the value of R2. Plugging in those previous values into the equation for the stage 1 gain, we get: 40 = 1 + 2R2*1000\u21d2R2 = 19,500 \u2126 It is important to ensure that when choosing the resistances, they are in the kOhm range because of the rule of thumb that the larger the resistor is, the more power is can safely dissipate without suffering damage. If the resistance is too small and there is too large of a current, there will be damage to the resistor and furthermore the circuit itself will not be able to function. Following the same protocol for stage 2, we arbitrarily picked a value of R3, 1 k\u2126, and then solved for R4. Plugging in the previous values into the equation for the stage 2 gain, we get: 25 = -R4*1000 \u21d2R4= 25000 \u2126 The negative sign is negated as resistances cannot be negative.

In addition to this requirement, because this filter does not need to include any further amplification, the quality factor is set to 1. As with the instrumentation amplifier, we first determined the values for R1, R2, R3, and C using the following design equations for a notch filter:R1= 1/(2Q\u23750C)R2= 2Q/(\u23750C) R3= R1R/(2R1 + R2)Q = \u23750/\u03b2\u03b2= \u2375c2 -\u2375c1 Where Q = quality factor \u23750= 2\u03c0f0= center frequency in rad/sec f0= center frequency in Hz \u03b2 = bandwidth in rad/sec \u2375c1, \u2375c2= cutoff frequencies (rad/sec)We arbitrarily picked a value of C, in this case it was 0.15 \u00b5F, and then subsequently solved for the value of R1.

If when solving for the resistances, one is too small, a value should be altered, such as the capacitance, to ensure that this does not occur. Similarly to solving the equation for R1, R2 and R3can be solved: R2= 2(1)/[(2\u03c060)(0.15x10-6)]= 289.9 k\u2126  R3= (1105.25)(289.9x103)/[(1105.25) + (289.9x103)]= 1095.84 \u2126 Additionally, solve for the bandwidth in order to have it as a theoretical value to compare to the experimental value later: 1 = (2\u03c060)/\u03b2\u21d2\u03b2 = 47.12 rad/sec Once you know the resistance values build circuit on the breadboard.Only this stage of the circuit is to be tested at this point, so it should not be connected to the instrumentation amplifier. The  Agilent E3631A DC Power Supply is used to power the operational amplifier with an output of +15 V and -15 V going to pins 4 and 7. The function generator is set to output a sinusoidal waveform with an initial frequency of 10 Hz, a Vpp of 1 V, and an offset of 0 V. The positive input should be connected to R1and the negative input should be connected to ground. The input should also be connected to channel 1 of the oscilloscope. The output of the notch filter, coming from pin 6 of the operational amplifier is displayed on channel 2 of the oscilloscope. An AC sweep is measured and recorded by varying the frequency from 10 Hz to 100 Hz. The frequency can be increased by increments of 10 Hz until reaching a frequency of 50. Then increments of 2 Hz are used until 59 Hz. Once 59 Hz is reached, increments of 0.1 Hz should be taken. Then, after 60 Hz is reached, the increments can once again be increased. The Vout/Vin ratio and phase angle is to be recorded. If the Vout/Vin ratio is not less than or equal to -20 dB at 60 Hz, the resistance values need to be altered to ensure this ratio. A frequency response plot and phase response plot is then constructed from this data. The frequency response should look like that in the graph, which proves that frequencies around 60Hz are removed, which is what you want!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSS/UYI4/JB3ZLXG0/FSSUYI4JB3ZLXG0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3K/6EW3/JB3ZLXF3/F3K6EW3JB3ZLXF3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Build Notch Filter and Test It"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "The cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter is determined as 150 Hz. This value was chosen because you wantto retain all of the frequencies present in the ECG while removing the excess noise, specifically found at higher frequencies. The frequency of the T wave lies in the range from 0-10 Hz, the P wave in the range from 5-30 Hz, and the QRS complex in the range 8-50 Hz. However, abnormal ventricular conduction is characterized by higher frequencies, typically above 70 Hz. Therefore, 150 Hz was chosen as the cutoff frequency in order to ensure that we can capture all frequencies, even the higher frequencies, while cutting off high frequency noise. In addition to the 150 Hz cutoff frequency, the quality factor, K, is set to 1 because no further amplification is required. We first determined the values for R1,R2, R3, R4, C1, and C2 using the following design equations for a low-pass filter:R1= 2/[\u2375c[aC2+sqrt([a^2 + 4b(K -1)]C2^2 - 4bC1C2)]]  R2= 1/[bC1C2R1\u2375c^2]   R3= K(R1+ R2)/(K -1)  when K > 1 R4= K(R1+R2)    C2 about 10/fc uF     C1 < C2[a2 + 4b(K -1)]4b  Where K = gain \u2375c= cutoff frequency (rad/sec) fc= cutoff frequency (Hz)  a = filter coefficient = 1.414214 b = filter coefficient = 1 Because the gain is 1, R3 is replaced by an open circuit and R4is replaced by a short circuit which makes it a voltage follower. Therefore, those values do not have to be solved. We first solved for the value of C2. Plugging in the previous values into that equation, we get: C2 = 10/150 uF=0.047 uF Then, C1 can be solved using the value of C2 . C1 < (0.047x10^-6)[1.414214^2 + 4(1)(1 -1)]/4(1) C1 < 0.024 uF= 0.022 uF Once the capacitance values have been solved for, R1 and R2 can be computed as follows: R1= 2(2\u03c0150)[(1.414214)(0.047x10-6)+([1.4142142 + 4(1)(1 -1)]0.047x10-6)2 - 4(1)(0.022x10-6)(0.047x10-6))] R1= 25486.92 \u2126 R2= 1(1)(0.022x10-6)(0.047x10-6)(25486.92)(2\u03c0150)2= 42718.89 \u2126With the right resistances build the circuit seen in the circuit diagram.This is the last stage of the overall design and should be built on the breadboard directly to the left of the notch filter with the output of the notch filter and the input voltage for the low-pass filter. This circuit is to be constructed using the same breadboard as previously, with the correctly computed resistances and capacitances, and one operational amplifier. Once the circuit is built using the circuit diagram in figure 3, it is tested. Only this stage is to be tested at this point, so it should not be connected to either the instrumentation amplifier or the notch filter.

The positive input should be connected to R1and the negative input should be connected to ground. The input should also be connected to channel 1 of the oscilloscope. The output of the notch filter, coming from pin 6 of the operational amplifier is displayed on channel 2 of the oscilloscope. An AC sweep is measured and recorded by varying the frequency from 10 Hz to  300 Hz. The frequency can be increased by 10 Hz increments until reaching the cutoff frequency of 150 Hz. Then, the frequency should be increased by 5 Hz until reaching 250 Hz. Higher increments of 10 Hz can be used to finish the sweep. The Vout/Vin ratio and phase angle is recorded. If the cutoff frequency is not 150 Hz, then the resistance values need to be altered to ensure this value is in fact the cutoff frequency.

The notch filter is used to remove noise at 60Hz because an ECG signal does not contain signals at 60Hz. Finally the low-pass filter removes higher frequencies to remove noise from the signal and in combination with the notch filter only allows in the frequencies that are represented in an ECG signal.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: Determine What Filters and Amplifiers to Use"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The amplifier is required to have a gain of 1000 V/V and as it can be seen, the amplifier is made up of two stages. Therefore, the gain must be distributed evenly among the two stages, with K1 being the gain of the first stage and K2 being the gain of the second stage. We determined K1 to be 40 and K2 to be 25. These are acceptable values due to the fact that when multiplied together, a gain of 1000 V/V is obtained, 40 x 25 = 1000, and they are of comparable amount, with a variance of 15 V/V. Using these values for the gain, the proper resistances can then be computed. The following equations are used for these calculations:Stage 1 Gain: K1 = 1 + 2R2R1 (1) Stage 2 Gain: K2 = -R4R3 (2) We arbitrarily picked a value of R1, in this case it was 1 k\u2126, and then subsequently solved for the value of R2. Plugging in those previous values into the equation for the stage 1 gain, we get: 40 = 1 + 2R2*1000\u21d2R2 = 19,500 \u2126 It is important to ensure that when choosing the resistances, they are in the kOhm range because of the rule of thumb that the larger the resistor is, the more power is can safely dissipate without suffering damage. If the resistance is too small and there is too large of a current, there will be damage to the resistor and furthermore the circuit itself will not be able to function. Following the same protocol for stage 2, we arbitrarily picked a value of R3, 1 k\u2126, and then solved for R4. Plugging in the previous values into the equation for the stage 2 gain, we get: 25 = -R4*1000 \u21d2R4= 25000 \u2126 The negative sign is negated as resistances cannot be negative.

In addition to this requirement, because this filter does not need to include any further amplification, the quality factor is set to 1. As with the instrumentation amplifier, we first determined the values for R1, R2, R3, and C using the following design equations for a notch filter:R1= 1/(2Q\u23750C)R2= 2Q/(\u23750C) R3= R1R/(2R1 + R2)Q = \u23750/\u03b2\u03b2= \u2375c2 -\u2375c1 Where Q = quality factor \u23750= 2\u03c0f0= center frequency in rad/sec f0= center frequency in Hz \u03b2 = bandwidth in rad/sec \u2375c1, \u2375c2= cutoff frequencies (rad/sec)We arbitrarily picked a value of C, in this case it was 0.15 \u00b5F, and then subsequently solved for the value of R1.

If when solving for the resistances, one is too small, a value should be altered, such as the capacitance, to ensure that this does not occur. Similarly to solving the equation for R1, R2 and R3can be solved: R2= 2(1)/[(2\u03c060)(0.15x10-6)]= 289.9 k\u2126  R3= (1105.25)(289.9x103)/[(1105.25) + (289.9x103)]= 1095.84 \u2126 Additionally, solve for the bandwidth in order to have it as a theoretical value to compare to the experimental value later: 1 = (2\u03c060)/\u03b2\u21d2\u03b2 = 47.12 rad/sec Once you know the resistance values build circuit on the breadboard.Only this stage of the circuit is to be tested at this point, so it should not be connected to the instrumentation amplifier. The  Agilent E3631A DC Power Supply is used to power the operational amplifier with an output of +15 V and -15 V going to pins 4 and 7. The function generator is set to output a sinusoidal waveform with an initial frequency of 10 Hz, a Vpp of 1 V, and an offset of 0 V. The positive input should be connected to R1and the negative input should be connected to ground. The input should also be connected to channel 1 of the oscilloscope. The output of the notch filter, coming from pin 6 of the operational amplifier is displayed on channel 2 of the oscilloscope. An AC sweep is measured and recorded by varying the frequency from 10 Hz to 100 Hz. The frequency can be increased by increments of 10 Hz until reaching a frequency of 50. Then increments of 2 Hz are used until 59 Hz. Once 59 Hz is reached, increments of 0.1 Hz should be taken. Then, after 60 Hz is reached, the increments can once again be increased. The Vout/Vin ratio and phase angle is to be recorded. If the Vout/Vin ratio is not less than or equal to -20 dB at 60 Hz, the resistance values need to be altered to ensure this ratio. A frequency response plot and phase response plot is then constructed from this data. The frequency response should look like that in the graph, which proves that frequencies around 60Hz are removed, which is what you want!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSS/UYI4/JB3ZLXG0/FSSUYI4JB3ZLXG0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3K/6EW3/JB3ZLXF3/F3K6EW3JB3ZLXF3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Build Notch Filter and Test It"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "The cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter is determined as 150 Hz. This value was chosen because you wantto retain all of the frequencies present in the ECG while removing the excess noise, specifically found at higher frequencies. The frequency of the T wave lies in the range from 0-10 Hz, the P wave in the range from 5-30 Hz, and the QRS complex in the range 8-50 Hz. However, abnormal ventricular conduction is characterized by higher frequencies, typically above 70 Hz. Therefore, 150 Hz was chosen as the cutoff frequency in order to ensure that we can capture all frequencies, even the higher frequencies, while cutting off high frequency noise. In addition to the 150 Hz cutoff frequency, the quality factor, K, is set to 1 because no further amplification is required. We first determined the values for R1,R2, R3, R4, C1, and C2 using the following design equations for a low-pass filter:R1= 2/[\u2375c[aC2+sqrt([a^2 + 4b(K -1)]C2^2 - 4bC1C2)]]  R2= 1/[bC1C2R1\u2375c^2]   R3= K(R1+ R2)/(K -1)  when K > 1 R4= K(R1+R2)    C2 about 10/fc uF     C1 < C2[a2 + 4b(K -1)]4b  Where K = gain \u2375c= cutoff frequency (rad/sec) fc= cutoff frequency (Hz)  a = filter coefficient = 1.414214 b = filter coefficient = 1 Because the gain is 1, R3 is replaced by an open circuit and R4is replaced by a short circuit which makes it a voltage follower. Therefore, those values do not have to be solved. We first solved for the value of C2. Plugging in the previous values into that equation, we get: C2 = 10/150 uF=0.047 uF Then, C1 can be solved using the value of C2 . C1 < (0.047x10^-6)[1.414214^2 + 4(1)(1 -1)]/4(1) C1 < 0.024 uF= 0.022 uF Once the capacitance values have been solved for, R1 and R2 can be computed as follows: R1= 2(2\u03c0150)[(1.414214)(0.047x10-6)+([1.4142142 + 4(1)(1 -1)]0.047x10-6)2 - 4(1)(0.022x10-6)(0.047x10-6))] R1= 25486.92 \u2126 R2= 1(1)(0.022x10-6)(0.047x10-6)(25486.92)(2\u03c0150)2= 42718.89 \u2126With the right resistances build the circuit seen in the circuit diagram.This is the last stage of the overall design and should be built on the breadboard directly to the left of the notch filter with the output of the notch filter and the input voltage for the low-pass filter. This circuit is to be constructed using the same breadboard as previously, with the correctly computed resistances and capacitances, and one operational amplifier. Once the circuit is built using the circuit diagram in figure 3, it is tested. Only this stage is to be tested at this point, so it should not be connected to either the instrumentation amplifier or the notch filter.

The positive input should be connected to R1and the negative input should be connected to ground. The input should also be connected to channel 1 of the oscilloscope. The output of the notch filter, coming from pin 6 of the operational amplifier is displayed on channel 2 of the oscilloscope. An AC sweep is measured and recorded by varying the frequency from 10 Hz to  300 Hz. The frequency can be increased by 10 Hz increments until reaching the cutoff frequency of 150 Hz. Then, the frequency should be increased by 5 Hz until reaching 250 Hz. Higher increments of 10 Hz can be used to finish the sweep. The Vout/Vin ratio and phase angle is recorded. If the cutoff frequency is not 150 Hz, then the resistance values need to be altered to ensure this value is in fact the cutoff frequency. The frequency response plot should look like the picture where you can see that the cut-off frequency is around 150Hz.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FK3/O0HC/JB3ZLXEF/FK3O0HCJB3ZLXEF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ0/53KA/JB3ZLXE8/FJ053KAJB3ZLXE8.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Build Low-pass Filter and Test It"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Connect all three stages by adding a wire between the last circuit component of the previous component to the beginning of the next component.

For the purposes of this tutorial I'll assume you are using the same sort of setup in the above link, the USBtinyISP programmer, and a linux (or unix-like) operating system. If you are using a different setup (especially if you are using a different programmer) you will likely have to edit the Makefile (again, too much to get into here, try reading the comments in the file).Once you have everything set up, and the programmer attached, it's time to program. I have found that the speaker can't be attached while programming, so you should unhook that for this step. It is also very important that the crystal be attached (along with the 2 18 pF capacitors), as it will become necessary after burning the fuses.DO NOT perform the next step (burn-fuse) if you are not using the crystal, once you do the AVR will require a crystal to operate. If you burn the fuses and you don't have a crystal your out of luck until you can get one.Now, we need to burn the AVR's fuses (see a tutorial on AVR's for more information, and the above warning).

After kicking around on the web, I found that dobros are built in much the same way as a regular acoustic guitar.  The only key difference is that they use resonator cones (cones fashioned from aircraft aluminum) to amplify the sound.  This difference is what gives a dobro that warm, rich sound that works so well with blues, country, and bluegrass.The cones are located in the body under the cover (which usually resembles a hubcap), and the bridge is seated directly on top of the cone.  The strings vibrate the bridge, which vibrate the cone, which resonates in the body of the guitar.To physically model a dobro, we need to process the track in a way that resembles this method of amplification.  I have both the line out from his guitar and a single mic for air.  Since Ovations have a piezo pickup in the bridge directly under the strings, we have a signal that is a clean representation of string vibration alone (I know, it also picks up the body, but I'm approximating here).  We also have the mic, which represents what the body of the guitar does to the sound.  The only thing we need to mimic is the resonator cone.Since I don't own a dobro, it would be senseless for me to purchase a cone as they are about $60.  I needed to find something cheap that was analogous; this is where the pie pans come in.  They're lighter and less dense, and not tuned (I mean, really, do you think Betty Crocker stands at the conveyor belt of the stamper, tuning pie pans?), but they do have an interesting ring to them when struck.

Before we get started, I think it's worth explaining a bit of the science behind what we're doing.If you go into a room and clap your hands, fire a pistol, or pop a balloon, you're exciting the air in the room with a broadband impulse.  The impulse is the sudden gush of air in all directions, broadband means that this impulse has a lot of frequency content.  The resulting echo is known as an impulse response; it is the response of the room's reverberation to the impulse you created.An impulse response is a sonic fingerprint of that space.  For a long time, ideas and math said that you can apply this impulse response to recorded sound and make it sound like it was recorded in the same room; this process is known as convolution.

Those who just want to dive in blindly can skip this.There are several ways you can create a usable impulse response.  The quick and dirty method involves using the loudest, shortest sound practical (such as a balloon pop or starter pistol).  Under the right conditions these yield decent results.  There are a few problems, however.First, noise is an engineer's enemy, and these methods are crippled by the fact that the maximum signal-to-noise ratio possible is limited to whatever you pick up from the mics.  Any noise, such as electrical hum, HVAC, the flap of a butterfly's wings, &c. will spoil the response.The second, and most obvious thing, is that these methods only work in real spaces.  You can't pop a balloon inside a pie pan, and I'm pretty sure firing blanks at it won't work either.So, we need to energize the pie pan by some means with some signal that we can use to obtain an impulse response.  Going back to my explanation of an impulse, it's broadband - meaning the energizing sound carries a large amount of frequency content.  There are two main types of signals you can use: a sine sweep (which we will use) and, as an FYI, a maximum-length sequence (preferred, but the software necessary to utilize this type of signal is beyond my budget).The sine sweep we will create later will slowly pass through all audible (and some inaudible) frequencies, like smearing through a single impulse from lowest to highest frequencies.  By comparing the original test tone with that of the pie pan, we can deconvolve an impulse response.The beautiful thing about using sine sweeps is noise immunity.  Since the deconvolution step uses an entirely mathematical method, it averages out noise.  The longer the sweep, the more noise it's capable of eliminating.  However, since amplitude in audio is a logarithmic beast, it takes an exponentially longer time to lower the noise floor by 6 dB.  I find 60 seconds to be sufficient, but if you have a noisy environment you can do several minutes if necessary.\"Okay, so how do we energize the pie pan?\"  That's where the speaker comes in.  We will modify it to work more like a solenoid (since it is anyway, mechanically speaking) and mount the pie pan to the speaker, thereby imparting the test tone through the object.Enough, let's have some fun.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F56/S4YX/FXA2U7GK/F56S4YXFXA2U7GK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FK7/261L/FXA2U7GY/FK7261LFXA2U7GY.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: WARNING!

Ideally you want a speaker cone with reasonably flat response.  It's okay if it's bass light; too much bass will bang the pan around in rather frightening ways.First, trim or break off any screw mounts around the edge.  You don't want the pie pan to take a random bang into any protrusions.Second, we will need to fix the bolt to the center of the speaker cone.  The little circle in the center of the cone is a dust cap.  Rarely does it serve any genuine acoustical purpose; it's simply meant to keep grit from getting into the voice coil and wrecking it.  So, we will carefully remove the cap.If you have the same speaker I bought for this, there's a shortcut I didn't know about until I started peeling the dust cap away.  If you turn the speaker over, you'll notice the magnet is actually a toroid.  The hole gives you access, so you can skip prying up the cap.Third, poke a hole in the center of the cap.  Do the best job you can at centering this hole; an off-center hole will cause the bolt to tip out of plumb and can cause odd vibrations later.  Make the hole just big enough that the screw will fit through.Next, poke a hole in a rubber booger and slide it all the way onto the bolt.  Fit this through the back of the dust cap.  Check the fit; it the cap won't fit down onto the center of the speaker, you can either discard the cap use the booger (if it seats tightly inside the cone) or use a smaller booger.  I don't think there's a real rule here, just do what feels best.Finally, using super glue or rubber cement, carefully glue the cap back into place.

Import the test tone we just created and solo the track.  Next, connect your mics to the audio input and create new tracks for them.As you'll see, I'm using two Nady microphones in a Blumlein configuration (one omnidirectional condenser mic for mid and one figure-eight ribbon mic for side).  How you do this is up to you, but there are a few things to consider.  You'll want a mic with a fairly flat response curve and low self-noise.  If you're mic'ing in stereo, there are many ways to do this.  Traditional stereo configurations will need two matched mics equidistant from the pan and spaced about 9\"-12\" apart.  They should aim towards the center of the pan.If we're all ready on the Dark Side of the Moon, play the sine tones.Play the sweep and first watch (and listen to) the pan.  You will hear all kinds of barking and squawking that, if broadcast over radio, would no doubt be interpreted as a \"WOW!\" signal by SETI.  Honestly, the only way to describe it is a sound that will make you realize you're running test tones through an aluminum pie pan (which will make you either feel like an idiot or a mad scientist).More importantly, though, you need to ensure that the pan doesn't bounce around or rattle.  Rattling is difficult to discern at times, but it's considerably different than the nice ringing you get (usually in the higher frequencies).  You'll get the hang of it.  If it's bouncing, decrease your volume until the ill behavior subsides.  If it rattles, make sure everything is good and tight; if it still doesn't go away, try decreasing the volume.Next, make sure to trim your mics so they max out at around -3 to -6 dBFS.Once you're satisfied, record.  You'll want to leave some trailing silence on each track since the deconvolver expects the recorded file to be longer than the test tones.  I left 10 seconds so I could have enough blank space to use noise reduction software later.Remember to also record the speaker with no pan attached.  This is for two reasons:1.  This will give you an impulse response of the speaker, which may come in handy for sound effects later on.2.  More importantly, we will also use this track as a reference.  If we take the output of the speaker and compare the pan's output to it, we eliminate the speaker and mics as a variable in the final impulse.  I've found this method to be a bit dicier, but when it does work the results are better.Next, use your wave editor of choice to first remove DC offset and then normalize the files directly (be careful, most DAW host programs use non-destructive editing, meaning any changes you make in the host will not be applied directly to the file.  That's swell for undo reasons, but not so good here.

You only want to remove as much noise as you can before it tampers with the good signal.  When in doubt, less reduction is better, because too much reduction will corrupt your impulse responses.Why not wait and do this to the final impulse response?  You get far better results if you do this here.  First, there's less chance of altering your wanted signal since the noise reduction algorithm only has to concentrate on a small frequency range at any given time.  Second, a higher signal-to-noise ratio here will result in an even better one after deconvolution, because whatever noise is left gets averaged and becomes quieter.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 11: Perform Noise Reduction (optional)"}, {"step": 12, "steps_text": "Now that we have our sweeps, it's time to deconvolve them.

Slower computers can take awhile.Once finished, close out of this and play your impulse responses.  If you did everything right, they should sound like someone struck a pie pan.If you have any strange ringing (like a pie pan ringing isn't already strange) then your recorded files are corrupt.  Either they have too much noise (like the pan rattling because it wasn't snug, or the speaker was overdriven), or too little (because you were overzealous with noise reduction).In either event, they have frequencies present that weren't originally in the test tone and they were loud enough to confuse the deconvolver.  Just record some new ones, and be more careful.  I know, I've been burnt like this plenty of times, but believe me - it's worth it, and it's almost always due to user error.After running through this, you'll also want to deconvolve a set of impulse responses using the speaker only tracks as the test tone file.  Remember to output the files to a different folder than the previous set.  When finished processing, check these out too and make sure they are okay.

It is not clear whether he succeeded or not to achieve the anticipated results, however, the coming practitioners followed his notion with a knife to form different rhythmic patterns on the surface of record (Thomas Brinkmann, Klick, 2000), or with a second hole to rotate the record off center to induce variations in pitch and speed (Non, Pegan Muzak, 1978). You could read more stories at Philip Samartzis's Surface Noize. In this instructables, we propose an alternative method, which legitimately follows the notion with a help of vector graphics software and current cutting machines.\nAnalog records have its origin in 1858, the invention of Phonoautograph by Leon Scott. At the moment the device only could transform the vibration of sound into graphical forms, however, after over a century, researchers renewed the history of earliest audio recording by decoding the sound from its graphical forms (more information at\u00a0Archaeologist of Sound\u00a0by Ron Cowen). In 1878, Frank Lambert made the talking clock, the first machine, which could play back the inscribed sound into lead with its own mechanism. After few months, Thomas Edison made the Phonograph, which record and reproduce (mainly) voices with a vertically vibrated stylus and a tin foil on a cylinder. In 1887, Emile Berliner proposed the Gramophone to record sounds on a disc. The Gramophone used a flat disk rotated on a horizontal plate as a recording surface. In its recording, a vibration of air according to time (i.e. sound) is converted into a horizontal vibration of stylus to etch a groove into the rotated surface. In play back, the procedure works in a reverse order. The stylus moves along the groove and the vibration is mechanically / electronically amplified to produce a monophonic sound (Figure). The mechanism also allowed multiple duplications with casting technique.\nAfter the Gramophone, the basic mechanism of record continued for a century with several inventions and experiments. For example, the change of diameters and rotational speeds, the appearance of\u00a0 45/45 stereophonic recording in 1950's, and a laser turntable in 1980's. Diverse materials were tested for the disc include not only standard shellac and vinyl but also other experimental stuff such as rice cake in 1920's, chocolate, or ice. In the late 1960's to 1970's, Dubplate was come from a reggae music scene. It uses an acetate disc, a recordable fragile disc originally invented for testing purpose with cutting machine. They used the disc to produce an original version (i.e. mixing) for their sound system. The culture of making a unique record has been continued since then such as a building of hand made cutting machine on a CD, or 3D Printed Record.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F81/250W/HD4VHHTV/F81250WHD4VHHTV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Background"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Materials:\u00a0Paper, Acrylic, Wood, etc. \u00a0*with paper cutter, we only could use paper.\nHardware: a.

Before the cutting, we need to adjust the machines (i.e. speed and power in Laser cutter, blade length in paper cutter)\u00a0in relation with the materials.*Laser cutter is a device to engrave or cut images on a material with a laser beam. To compare with it to office printers, instead of printing the image with substantial ink or toner, it could produce the image without physical contact. Because of its principle to burn away a surface of material, it is difficult to treat some materials such as vinyl which produce poisonous gas or metals with reflective surface. Beside that, it could be used with diverse materials such as paper, wood, acrylic, and leather. Normally, a laser cutter provides two modes: raster, and vector. In raster, the laser beam horizontally scans\u00a0 (i.e. burn) the surface based on a bitmap or painted data. In vector, the laser beam outlines on the surface to make a continuous line for engrave and cut based on a vector data. In our method, we mainly used the vector to engrave the wave form (Figure).*Paper cutter uses a thin cutter blade in place of a laser beam to engrave or cut an image. It works in a similar way to laser cutter. Based on its structure to rotate the blade on the surface, it only could treat vector data with thin materials such as paper, adhesive vinyl, or film. Normally, the cost of a paper cutter is about one hundredth of a laser cutter (e.g. $200 vs $20,000) (Figure).\nAfter the adjustment, we could cut a record almost in the same way as printing a paper with an office printer. In both machine, it approximately takes 3 to 5 min in the case of a locked groove. With paper cutter, you also need to cut the paper with scissors, and make a hole with a cutter (Figure).\u00a0", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FF8/P3QR/HDOVWHHD/FF8P3QRHDOVWHHD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSE/TPBO/HDOVWHHG/FSETPBOHDOVWHHG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHT/N2SW/HDOVWHHY/FHTN2SWHDOVWHHY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F86/JVY3/HDOVWHI1/F86JVY3HDOVWHI1.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Cutting a Record"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "\n          After the cutting, we just need to put the record on our turntable and put a needle on it.

Take them wherever you want. You should be able to get a couple of hours of full volume out of the batteries.\nBut I\u00a0have a question, and I'm hoping some of you more experienced people can help me. When designing the battery system, I\u00a0originally planned on using 10 AA batteries. This is because I planned on using rechargeables, which are only 1.2 volts. 10 x 1.2 = 12 volts. Then I\u00a0wasn't going to use a voltage regulator, because i was going to have the exact amount of voltage.

In fact, when I\u00a0connected 8 batteries it exceeded 12 volts.\nThat's when I\u00a0decided I would need a regulator. So I ended up testing it with 8 batteries, but I assumed the voltage was high because they were fully charged, and once they lost some power, the voltage would drop too low. But that wasn't the case! The amp ran for hours off 8 batteries! I am confused as to why this setup works. The batteries should only be producing 9.6 volts. I would appreciate it if anyone could explain why this works.\nBy the way, you may not even need a voltage regulator because after testing the original power supply, I\u00a0discovered it actually provides something around 25 volts.

I\u00a0also want to replace the wire that plugs into an ipod with a 1/8 inch jack, so you can plug in a standard 1/8 inch cable. That way all the wires are removable and the input and outputs are more standard.\nI thought about removing the amplifier and putting it in a separate container. Getting the amp out of the case is really easy. The problem is finding a case that will still allow you to control the volume and plug in your power without opening it. I once had an amp like this, and I\u00a0just took the circuit board out and stuck it in an insulated tin. In order to change the volume, you had to open the tin and turn the potentiometer that's connected to the circuit board. Needless to say, this amp didn't last long.

Understanding this will help us manipulate the sound later on. Ok, so go look at a zipper. See the individual teeth? So as you pull, you can feel vibration and hear sound right? This is the friction of the two teeth coming together changing energy type from mechanical, the force you are putting on the zipper pull, to heat and sound as well as mechanical, the teeth coming together. This is because of the law of conservation of energy: energy cannot be created nor destroyed. It can only change form. Also Carnot's theorem says that you can't get 100% efficiency, you lose some energy to the other types present in this process. In our case, heat and sound. Friction between the metal parts creates heat, and vibration which in other words is sound.

The rate at which they move in one set amount of time (a period) is called frequency and is measured in Cycles per Second, or more commonly known as Hertz, but in our case, we can look at it in teeth per second. Frequency in simple terms, is how high/low the sound will be. So the more sets of teeth in one second, the higher the sound. But the limitation of the \u201czipperstrument\u201d is the fact that the higher the frequency, the shorter the length of the note can be. There is an equation for that, but it is complicated and we won\u2019t touch it in this Instructable.

Record yourself clicking four times (evenly)Press record again with headphones on, and click in time with the last two clicks. This means that you listen to the first two clicks in order to judge when the last two will be, and click in time with themYou should notice that, when you play it back, the second track is not in time with the first. To fix this, highlight the distance between the 3rd click on the first track and the 1st click on the second track.At the bottom, select 'length' and make a note of the number there. (Mine was 136ms) Go to edit>preferences>recording, then enter you number into the latency correct box. Make sure you convert seconds to milliseconds correctly, and also make sure that it has the right sign in front of it. If the second track is too late then use a negative sign, if the second track is too early then leave it positive. Record both sets of clicks again and you should find that they are in time! The Hard wayThis is a little more hassle but it is guaranteed to be exactly in time. Get a 3.5mm male to male lead. Plug one end into the speaker out and one end into the line in/microphone socket. (restart audacity) In audacity go to: generate> click track. Change the click sound to tick and change the duration to 2 seconds. You should see 4 clicks, like in the picture above. Change the microphone to 'Line In' (or microhpone socket if your computer doesn't have a line in)Press record. Stop after the 4 ticks have been recorded. What this does is play 4 ticks through the speaker jack, which goes directly back into the line in which records the 4 ticks of the speaker. Highlight the distance from the start of the 2nd track to the beginning of the first tick on the second track. Click 'length' on the bottom and make a note of the length of time. Mine was 139ms.

I won't go too much into the build of the actual amp here but I will give details of my parts and where I acquired them from. \u00a0There are already a few instructables on building a gainclone and several websites almost dedicated to the subject and I could not even scrape the surface of the possibilities in building one. \u00a0There are so many different options for the same result. \u00a0Decide on the amp you want to build, learn how to build it and then come back here for the 'smarts' to put in it. This is not a beginner project, especially the amp itself. It involves wiring of mains power and can be extremely dangerous to those that are not knowledgeable in this area - Do not take chances.\u00a0 If you are not a competent solderer and don't have a reasonable knowledge of electronics and feel safe playing with mains power, this project might not be for you. A big thanks goes to ASCAS\u00a0for the initial inspiration to build one of these amps! What this instructable is mostly about, is the 'front end' of the amp - In this case it is an Arduino powered sound processor and input switcher. The main components that allow this to work are: Arduino Nano TDA7439 Sound processor chip TEA5767 Radio module DS1307 RTC clock module The TDA7439 allows the switching of 4 sources to one output, Bass/Mid/Treb control, Input gain and volume control (among others). The functions of the chip are controlled via the i2c bus. It's commonly found in car audio applications but is perfectly suited to this use too. \u00a0The only downside to it is it's in a DIP30 package which means you cant breadboard it, even worse is that there seems to be no easily obtainable sockets for a DIP30 chip. \u00a0However, the pin spacing is still solderable by hand. \u00a0The chips cost a couple of dollars so if you fry one, its not the end of the world. To make this even easier to use, I have authored an Arduino library so all you need are simple commands to use the functions of the chip. The TEA5767 is an FM radio module, also controlled by the i2c bus and is extremely easy to use. \u00a0I would have preferred a DAB (digital) radio but the modules available are limited and somewhat awkward to use at the moment. \u00a0Maybe in V2.... The DS1307 RTC is included for the sake of it, \u00a0I just wanted to have a clock :) \u00a0It's also on the i2c bus.", "title": "Arduino Powered Gainclone (amplifier)", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Powered-Gainclone-amplifier/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "For my actual amp, the main components I used are: 2 X 25V, 100VA Toroids from Element14\u00a0- They were on special at the time for $15ea! \u00a0Sadly, they no longer are. 2 X Power supply boards from AliExpress 2\u00a0X LM3886 Amplifier modules, also from AliExpress However, a search for LM3886 on eBay or AliExpress will turn up a magnitude of results - Take your pick!

You could possibly just use a decent 5v supply. A way of fabricating the board * The system is controllable by buttons and an IR remote. \u00a0The only functionality that is not in both is tuning the radio. \u00a0This is currently by IR only. So, if you wanted to leave out the Rotary encoder for the most minimalist look, you could just use the IR remote. Also, the rotary encoder I am using was surplus stock from a massive manufacturing workshop shutdown, hence it is probably worth >$100 but cost me a couple of dollars. It does all the debouncing and signal processing itself, so there is nothing in the code to handle a 'raw' encoder signal. It is also a 1000ppr sensor so there is a divider in the interrupt service routine to reduce it's sensitivity. \u00a0In theory, there is no reason that a mechanical one would not work but it may require some debouncing on the inputs.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FDB/4HHX/HTIWJ6W8/FDB4HHXHTIWJ6W8.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Collecting the Parts"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "These days I use a CNC machine to fab my boards but there is no reason this could not be made with toner transfer, positive resist etc. \u00a0Use what suits you. \u00a0I will mention however that the TDA7439 is fairly unforgiving for misaligned holes. \u00a0Take your time when drilling the holes if you are doing it by hand.

If you go this route please feel free to skip to the next Step. However if you are a glutton for punishment, you can build your own speaker mounts similar to what is shown. What you are looking at is about a week's worth of work.Speakers If you compare the new speakers with the original you will notice that the new speakers are much thicker and a little bit smaller than the pieces they replace. The new speakers are rated for 3 Watts and 8 Ohms, so they have similar impedance to most headphones on the market. This basically means that they will sound about as loud as another pair of commercial headphones for a specific volume level. The difference is these can go to 11. Well, not really, but they can get much louder before failing compared to almost any other headset. For example, each speaker is rated to generate 85 decibels of sound using only 1 Watt of power from almost 20 inches away. Also keep in mind that each speaker can run at three times that power and up to four in peak situations. Clearly these are not your normal headset speakers. These are usually used in higher end computer speakers and small stereos and not made to put directly on your ear; however when you do, they sound fantastic. A quick word about the old speakers. Even though they serve the same purpose they are not built with a traditional voice coil as your typical dynamic loudspeaker. Instead, they use an electric coil to vibrate an actuator bar that pushes on a rod which vibrates a metal disk. While this is great at making a lot of noise, it is restricted to a fairly small tonal range. That is why it's great for reproducing a voice in an aircraft where quality does not matter, but it is terrible at accurately reproducing music. (An older version can be seen opened up in the last picture).Mounting Bracket The mounting bracket holds the speaker as tightly as possible while still matching up with the same mounting screw holes and allows the wires to be easily connected. I tried to make the first one completely out of sculpting clay, however it was impossible to get the impression I wanted from the speaker and keep the shape that I needed. For the next try I used a bracket from a different David Clark headset as a base to sculpt the speaker mounts around. The black and white piece you see is actually built from 6 different plaster sculpting and casting sessions before the final shape was made. This was cast into a silicon mold and after it set was broken up and chipped out. Then the mold was sliced in half to facilitate easier extraction. Rubber bands were used to hold the halves together while the liquid plastic set. Unfortunately, it was still very difficult to get out and quite rough, requiring a lot of sanding to get into decent shape. To improve the looks, I took one of the better casts, sanded and polished it to a nice smooth finish and cast it into a new silicon mold horizontally for easier removal.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWJ/2CLZ/HI3TRZ72/FWJ2CLZHI3TRZ72.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3R/SV68/HI3TRZ7D/F3RSV68HI3TRZ7D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX7/6K81/HI3TRZ7A/FX76K81HI3TRZ7A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRU/TEGV/HI3TRZYT/FRUTEGVHI3TRZYT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ5/061E/HI3TRZ8K/FJ5061EHI3TRZ8K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1T/91UW/HI3TRZ8G/F1T91UWHI3TRZ8G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4S/UGX2/HI3TRZE4/F4SUGX2HI3TRZE4.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Building Speaker Mounts"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "The speaker casings are designed to be a very tight fit and essentially snap onto the speaker as there are no screw locations or easy points attached to the speaker.

Although the mounts are rigid, the last thing desired is for something to come loose. I highly recommend gluing the speakers to the plastic mount using a two part epoxy.

They are available, but prices start from \u20ac350/$400. So I decided to make one myself to see if I could make it cheaper.Ideally my electronic recorder would also be capable of making it's own sounds like a synthesizer, however although I'm not entirely new to electronics, I\u2019m not an expert either. Also I wanted a design achievable/understandable for beginners with low cost and easily obtainable parts. So decided to start with the most simplest form: a midi controller looking and playing like a recorder using push buttons and air flowspeed detection. The midi recorder connects via a midi-to-usb adapter to a computer which produces sound using a software synthesizer (on a pc, freeware), and (optionally) send it back to the a speaker inside the midi recorder. The cost of this simple midi recorder turned out to be less than $40!Although not quite as advanced as a commercial EWI and the construction is my first try, it works fine and I think it is a good base to make all sorts of improvements:an internal synthesizer - e.g. SparkFun Music Instrument Shield is available for $30  https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10587 and responds to midi commands          touch buttons - e.g. http://www.ebay.com/itm/New-MPR121-Breakout-V12-Ca...) available for $2.02          more buttons - previous breakout supplies 12 buttons!          a slider potentiometer - e.g. http://www.ebay.com/itm/Electronic-Block-10K-Slidi... available for $2.32          recording of a sound to use as an instrument, hope this is possible!          etc. I'll probably show you some of these improvements in a follow-up instructable.

The first picture shows a schematic of the components above and the data flow between them.What we need to makeComputer: Install a vst-host and find a audio synthesizer plugin.   Midi2Usb converter: Add a audio cable tot usb side of the converter which receives audio from computer. Replace the Serial Midi (DIN-5) cables with a custom cable to the recorder which provides power to the controller, receives midi data from the controller (to be send to pc) and optional another cable to send audio (generated by pc) to the speaker inside the controller.    Midi Recorder Controller: Detects finger presses (with 9 pushbuttons) and airflow/breath (with a microphone which registers audio level) and converts this user input to serial midi (with an Arduino). Also outputs audio received from the pc (amplifier and speaker).The second picture shows you how the end results looks, The following steps in more detail how to make the components.The instructable can be divided in two partsPart I - step 3 to 7: setup the computer, modify the Midi2Usb converter and make the basic parts of the Midi Recorder Controller so it\u2019s able to communicate with the computer and play a simple (midi) tune.   Part II - step 9 and further: we will add the user input (buttons and breath flow sensor) to the Midi Recorder Controller as well as install the optional speaker.Step 8 explains how to test your setup and can be used from step 7 onward to constantly check if your modifications \u2018broke\u2019 something.(Installing the speaker in the midi recorder and attached the audio cable/plug to the Midi2Usb converter are optional if you don't mind the sound coming from your computer.)When using the terms recorder and controller alone or together, you should read midi recorder controller.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F3R/4MLJ/ILV3NW8G/F3R4MLJILV3NW8G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHP/VIU5/IL5I65KN/FHPVIU5IL5I65KN.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: How It Works and What We Need to Make"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "You'll need some supplies and basic tools.

You can also omit the socket and solder the midi2usb converter directly to the midi recorder.        Instead of screwing the ducts back to back, you can also glue them together, in which case you don't need the 4mm nuts and bolts.

If you cannot obtain this type of duct no problem, but be sure your duct can house the electronics (I wouldn't buy a much smaller duct). If your duct dimensions differ, also be aware you have the modify the dimensions of the wooden strip and block.My duct has a double bottom, this is not necessary and in fact only troublesome.Cut two pieces of duct at a length of about 400 mm. These pieces should be mounted together back-to back. My duct had nice holes predrilled to mount it to the wall, which I used to screw (4mm nut and bolt) them together.

However the Arduino Nano needs to connect to the power distribution board and buttons in the upper duct. A passage way for the wires between upper and lower duct is needed.Often the Arduino Nano will be shipped to you with male pin headers (first picture). However I found it easier to attach other components if I use female pin header on the Nano. So I soldered these on. (You don't need to solder on the ICSP (2x3) pinheader, but if you do, you should make an extra opening between lower and upper duct to  provide room for these pins.)The Nano should be put in lower duct (fourth picture) leaving enough room to install the microphone sensor board in a later step with an extra 1 cm margin.To plug in wires from the upper duct into the pins of the Nano, I made two slots between the two ducts (fifth picture). I used a Dremel and small file for this, but a drill and small file should also work.The Arduino Nano\u2019s pinheaders are pushed into the slots, This will also keep the Arduino Nano from shifting in de lower duct, so I didn't need to glue/screw it in place.This fifth picture also shows you that the female pin header can be stacked. By soldering female header to the wires of other components (e.g. the wire ends of the buttons as shown in the picture) you can easily plugin wires into the Arduino through the slots.Next thing we need to do is connect the Arduino to the power distribution board. Take two flexible wires just long enough to span the distance between the power distribution board and Arduino pins in the upper duct, Solder one wire to the GND rail and the other to the 5V rail of the power distribution board. Then solder these wires to the outer pins of a female pin header of three pins. (So the middle pin has no wire attached.) This  3-pin-header should be plugged into the 5V-RST-GND pins.

Because it is slightly higher than the duct, I had to make a hole for the socket to poke through. Since I made the hole a little bit too small for the base of the socket it can't fall through and I didn't need to glue the socket in the duct. As the sockets can differ slightly in size and shape you may have to alter this for your specific socket and/or (hot)glue it.The third picture with the schematic shows how to connect the socket:pin 1 of RJ11 soldered to a flexible wire routed to the upper duct (via the hole for the 5V/GND wires in step 4) and soldered to a 220 ohm resistor which should be inserted into the TX/D1 pin of the Arduino Nano (see second picture).   pin 2 of RJ11 soldered to the flexible 5V wire from the distribution board in step 4   pin 3 of RJ11 soldered to the flexible GND wire from the power distribution board in step 4Modify Midi2Usb deviceThe third picture also shows how to make the telephone cable to the Midi2Usb device.

For the windows platform you have to follow these steps:Make sure you have the Arduino IDE installed (additional libraries are not necessary) and the driver to connect to your Arduino Nano.       Download the file 'MidiRecorder_PianoFingering.ino' file/sketch included in this step (scroll down).          Open your 'Documents\\Arduino' folder, make a new folder there and call it MidiRecorder_PianoFingering'  (If this folder is not the place where you keep your sketches you probably are experienced enough with the Arduino IDE to figure the proper steps out yourself :-) )  Place the downloaded file in this new folder.          Connect your Arduino to your pc via USB.          Open de Ino file within your Arduino IDE         Make sure you have selected the right development board (Arduino Nano 168 or 328) and have selected the right COM port.          Press upload to upload the sketch to your Arduino Nano.Explanation of sketchI tried to keep the sketch as simple as possible and decided not to use flute fingering (in which notes are combination of button presses), but piano fingering (in which each button press is different note):Setup - In the setup we tell the Arduino that the pins connected to the buttons are input pints. If the thumb button is pressed (or no buttons are attached) we set the state variable to demoMode.     Loop - if state is demoMode - A melody is send to the computer to synthesize. The melody is a string (e.g. \"c4 d2 e4\") in QBasic style (https://en.wikibooks.org/...#PLAY). The melody repeats after 2 seconds.     Loop - if state is NOT demoMode - We determine the volume of sound received by the microphone (=maximum difference between analog signals) and send a volume midi ('Control Change') message. Also we check all buttons one at a time for their state. If newly pressed we send a noteon ('Channel Voice') midi message. If the thumb buttons is also pressed the note we send will be a sharp one. If newly unpressed we send a noteoff midi message. For more info about how midi works, see this excellent instructable:  https://www.instructables.com/id/What-is-MIDI/.Setting up the software synthesizerSoftware synthesizers (vst) often come as plugins with file extension dll. These plugins need a host to run. A nice free vst-host is savihost. I choose the VST2 version, including keyboard. You can download it from http://www.hermannseib.com/english/savihost.htm. You can use almost all vst plugins you like, since we only send the most basic midi messages to the synthesizer (noteon/noteoff and volume change messages). Some suggestions on plugins (all free to use): Lxox_Flute - http://www.vst4free.com/free_vst.php?id=188Kontakt 5 - http://www.native-instruments.com/en/specials/free...Synth1 -  https://www.kvraudio.com/product/synth1-by-ichiro...TAL_Elek7ro -  https://tal-software.com/products/tal-elek7roTX16Wx. http://www.tx16wx.com/I like to use Lxox_Flute because of it's simplicity and nice flute simulation. Elek7ro is also not too hard to understand and lets you create other instruments. Synth1 has a nice set of predefined wind instruments and lets you remap your breath volume to another effect. TX16Wx lets you use your own sample sounds (wav-files).  Kontakt 5 has a nice solid feeling to it.To run a plugin you need to rename (or copy) savihost.exe to match the filename of the vst-plugin dll-file. After running the new exe, make sure to activate midi in menu 'Devices'>'Midi' and set the 'Input Port 1' to your midi2USB device (see first picture).Note: I noticed the Lxox_Flute plugin does not make sound on low octaves. The Arduino 'Oct' variable is set to octave 5 which works on my setup. If this doesn't work on your setup (improbable) you can change the Arduino 'oct' variable or transform the octave via VSTHost menu 'PlugIn' > submenu 'Transformation' > set 'Channel' to '1' > set 'Transposition' to '+1 Octave' (see second picture).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ2/FAQH/ILGVFU37/FQ2FAQHILGVFU37.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7D/Z26I/ILY0RUPP/F7DZ26IILY0RUPP.LARGE.jpg", "/assets/img/pixel.png"], "step_title": "Step 7: Arduino Sketch and Software Synthesizer"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "At this point we can test if the communication from Arduino to software synthesizer (on computer) is working:Attach your midi2usb converter to your computer.

My perforated board is only wide enough for four buttons, so I needed two pieces for the upper duct and one small piece for the lower duct. I also found it more comfortable if the pink button has less distance to the previous button than the others.We need to provide every button with ground, 5 volts and a data line. The circuit picture shows how to connect the buttons (dashed ground line is on the back side of the perf board, red and purple solid lines are on the front side of the perf board). In the overview picture you can see that I routed the (purple) data lines of the right board underneath the left board so the cables wouldn't prevent the lid to close. I soldered the data lines of the buttons in the upper duct to a female 8-pin header for easy insertion into pin D3 to D10 of the Arduino Nano. The 5V and GND lines were connected to the 5V and GND rails of the power distribution board. The data line of the thumb button was routed through the hole between lower and upper duct and inserted into D11 of the Arduino Nano. (In this case using a female 2-pin header.) You can also route the 5V and GND lines of the thumb button through the hole and solder them to rails on the power distribution board. However I soldered them directly to 5V and GND of the RJ11 socket to minimize on the amount of wires going through the enclosure.After installing all buttons (upper duct and lower duct) we can drill the holes in de lid. I used a 10mm drill bit. This is a bit larger than needed but gives some room for shifting the button boards in the enclosure without the buttons catching the side of the holes and coming stuck after pressing them.After this I placed the lids and install the button caps. The boards should sit high enough in de duct to give the buttons enough room to be pressed down. Two  buttons didn\u2019t sit high enough and couldn\u2019t be pressed down, so I slid some paper underneath the board to lift the button up towards the lid.Note: If you want to install the speaker, you need to keep extra room between the thumb button and the RJ-11 socket to place the audio socket in step 11.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FGT/FVNH/IL5I6CU3/FGTFVNHIL5I6CU3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Add Buttons"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "The microphone sensor board will be used as a simple airflow sensor and listensto the amount of sound your breath makes.

There are also variations of this board with the microphone already on its side.The microphone board has a potentiometer which makes it too high for the duct and this potentiometer has a screw to fine tune the microphone. So I needed to make a square hole in the lid to make room for the potentiometer and to keep the screw accessible. For this I drilled two (round) holes next to each other and used a small file to square the shape.The board should be connected to ground and 5V. The analog pin on the board is connected to A0 of the Arduino.

However I soon found out that due to interference the sound quality became very bad. Because of this I used a seperate audio cable to transport the audio signal, which gave much better sound. The only common connection between the audio circuit and the arduino circuit is the 5V coming from the telephone cable (and besides powering the arduino/buttons/microphone via the power distribution board) which also powers the amplifier board. So there is no direct ground connection (adding this seemed to enhance the audio interference) and I rely on the ground circuitry inside the pc. Consider if you find this wise for your own build!In this step the audio socket, the speaker and amplifier are placed in the lower duct. The socket is placed between the RJ-11 socket and the thumb button, the amplifier board is placed on the other side of the thumb button, the speaker at the end of the duct. The speaker just fits if we trim the receding rims to make some room (first picture). I used a hobby knife to carve the inner rims away. Then I attached two wires to the speaker (green and white).Next up is drilling the holes. Since we want to mark where they need to be, I applied masking tape to the lid. (This also makes removing the markings a lot easier.) First I marked the corner holes to fix the speaker to the lid using small bolts. I used the speaker as a template to mark the corner holes and drilled them with a matching drill bit (2mm, second picture - red circles). After this I drawed a grid on the lid to mark all the sound holes and used a slightly bigger drill bit (3mm). The amp board was placed between the thumb button and speaker (see fifth picture, second one from the bottom). 5V of the amp board (bottom left) can be connected to the power distribution board, but since the thumb button also has 5V and to reduce the wires, I connected the amp board here. The audio wire (green) from  the audio socket was connected to the audio-left-in of the amp board (upper left). The ground wire (white) from the audio socket was connected to audio-ground of the amp board (upper left).Only thing left is connecting the speaker wires to the audio-out-left of the amp board (upper right). It is not really important if we attach the white speaker wire to + or -, (but would be if we would have connected two speakers.) Bottom picture shows the closed duct with speaker and amp board inside.Note: The second picture from the bottom shows a schematic instead of the photo of my resulting lower duct.

Next I made a nice shape for the mouth using first a coarse file, followed by finer files and finally fine sandpaper.The schematic shows how I shaped the mouth piece and where I drilled the holes for the air channel. The diameter of the holes on the mouth side are 2mm-4mm and are filed down to a nice oval opening. On the back two holes are needed: A hole at the bottom which exits to the microphone (via an inserted straw) and a hole in the middle which connects the mouth opening to the opening for the straw. The end of middle hole is plugged so all air exist via the straw in the bottom hole. The diameter of the holes on the back end depends on the diameter of the straw you use, which in my case was 10mm. This diameter also depends on the air flow you feel comfortable with and of course what type of straw you can obtain/buy.Preparing the strawThe mouthpiece and microphone sensor are connected with before mentioned straw. This air you blow in the straw will contain harmful moisture, so I put a piece of plastic foil (from a sandwich bag) at the end of the straw. (If the foil at this end is pressed against the microphone, the sound will still be detected.) However now the air cannot escape, so I cut a hole in the straw and a corresponding opening in the bottom duct at the corresponding position.Securing mouthpiece to enclosureThe only simple solution I could think of to secure the mouthpiece to the enclosure was to connect them with wooden strips at either side.I made the strips as long as the combined length of the enclosure and my mouthpiece (470 mm in my case). Using standard wood glue I first glued the sides to the mouthpiece. Next I placed the enclosure in between and drilled two holes through at the beginning and end of the enclosure, avoiding hitting any electronics. Using cabinet screws (see last picture) I screwed the plastic enclosure in between the strips.Protect the wood from moistureEspecially the mouth piece needs protection from moisture in your mouth.I applied a clear finish (multiple times) to the outside of the mouth piece and also (for aesthetic reasons) to the side strips. I used a toy safe \"rust-oleum clear sealer satin - toy safe\"Also the inside of the mouthpiece (the air channel) needs protection. I treated this with a little bit of vegetable oil (olive should also work).Alternative strawsI tried some variations on the straw design, see second picture. I expected the second double straw design to be more effective since it forces the air stream to pass closer by the microphone. I also expected the dogwhistle  to be more effective since it produces sound (inaudible but sound nonethteless). By more effective I mean that the sensor values should be more stable and easier to (graduately) manipulate with your breath. I was suprised to find the other designs made no significant difference, and it was even more difficult to reach a high sensor value with the dog whistle. Since the original design is easier to build than the double straw design and cheaper than the dog whistle, I decided to stick with it.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTE/PB3B/IL5I6U6X/FTEPB3BIL5I6U6X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX5/B4PF/ILY0QXXS/FX5B4PFILY0QXXS.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 12: Mouthpiece and Wooden Sides"}, {"step": 13, "steps_text": "I recorded some audio samples to give you an idea how your result might sound.

One thing that I can call 'organised' and 'fully functional'. One thing that I can touch and know that it is reliable and ready for action at a moments notice - and that is my wonderful home made Hackable Arduino Prototyping Board.This vaporisation project was initially envisaged to be a simple fumigation machine for beehives, but very quickly got completely out of hand and developed into so much more than that. Indeed, people are now flocking from all four corners of my island to witness the amazingly performance of this machine as it sits in the centre of my living room vaporising all manner of exotic substances, including frankincense and cheese.Back to December ...... It is Winter 2015 and Sussex university has just published a report that concludes that vaporising oxalic acid is the best way to treat honey bees for the varroa mite. I must therefore build my vaporising machine immediately. There can be no delay .......... I wonder what else I can vaporise?The varroa is a tiny 'mite' that lives on honey bees and in their brood cells, sucking the bee's blood for nutrition. It is not particularly harmful in itself, but it does carry some very nasty diseases which are very harmful to the bees and can cause complete destruction of the colony if kept unchecked. I must act now to protect my bees.The treatment for varroa must be performed in the coldest part of Winter, when the amount of brood cells in the hive is at it's minimum as the mites can hide in these cells and completely avoid the oxalic acid vapour. The report was only released on the 17th of December and so the pressure is on for me to build my fumigation machine before the bees start to produce more brood in the early spring.Fortunately, I have a whole load of electronic bits and pieces left over from previous projects, so with a bit of hunting around in my untidy workshop and unsoldering of a few components here and there I was able to build this project in time for the coldest part of Winter to arrive.Apart from my illustrious hackable prototyping board, this project was very much designed as I went along and I made no drawings or sketches before hand. I drew the main vaporisation chamber in Fusion 360 as this was the most esoteric part of the design. Much of the metal tube and plate was picked up off the workshop floor or found in dirty rat infested boxes leftover from months/years/decades gone by.I am so pleased with the end result that the machine now doubles up as a coffee table in my lounge. Occasionally, if I am 'in the mood', I press the 'on' button and vaporise something, sometimes just for fun and sometimes to fill the air with exotic perfumes. Surely, this must be the most ridiculously over engineered air freshener ever built?", "title": "Arduino Controlled Beehive Fumigator / Air Freshener", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Controlled-Air-Freshener-Beehive-Fumigator/", "section": "home", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "This Instructable actually has three major parts to it:Demonstrating the features of the prototyping board by doing an actual project on it.     \nUsing and coding an Arduino to control a potentially hazardous process and produce warning sounds.    \nBuilding an electrical heating device to vaporise and inject chemicals into a beehive to kill varroa mites.Most likely, specific parts of this projects will be useful to people, like how to use resistance wire to build your own heater and how to control a hazardous process using an Arduino.

Unless the beekeeper is wearing the proper mask, he will be exposed to very toxic acid fumes.The question everybody will be asking is 'Could we not have a very long cable to the heating pan device?' and  'Why go to all the trouble of making a controller?' also 'Why not just have a battery and a big switch to operate the device?'All of these questions are very worthwhile. Oxalic fumes are toxic to human beings and yes, we could have a long cable, a switch and a battery and hide in an underground bunker whilst operating the device remotely. Or we could use the existing products in the market place, which inevitably expose the beekeeper to nasty oxalic acid fumes.As engineers it is our jobs to ask lots of awkward questions and look at all the potential problems in minute detail. Believe me, this will drive your boss crazy and he will soon start shouting obscenities in your general direction.If we look at this device in particular, we can torment our imaginary boss with the following questions and statements:\"Brian, we need to be able prevent the beekeeper from being exposed to the oxalic acid fumes\"\"OK Tecwyn, we'll put the device on a long cable with a big switch and hide in a bunker\"\"Errrrr ..... Well  ..... It's not quite as simple as that. We also need to be able to control the temperature at which we heat the powder\"To which Brian answers: \"You engineers just love to find problems with everything. What's the matter with you guys?\"\"Errrrr ..... Yes ...... But that's my job isn't it?\"\"No\" says Brian, \"Your job is to make this device as quickly and cheaply as possible.\"\"We also need to make sure the device is cold before the beekeeper tries to put more powder in it\" I say, nervously.By this time Brian, my imaginary boss, is reaching for a large bottle of whiskey in his desk draw.\"We also need warning lights or sounds to indicate that the device is producing fumes\".Brian replies: \"Well you've just succeeded in turning a cheap $50 product into a something ten times as expensive. Are you trying to bankrupt the company?\"\"No\" I reply, \"We have to make sure that the device does it's job properly and does not harm the beekeeper\".Brian now drinks the whiskey, reaches back in his desk draw for his pump action shotgun and I run out of the building as fast as possible with shots being fired behind me.Personally, I can not give my imaginary boss the satisfaction of seeing me take short cuts and produce a second rate fumigation machine with no proper control system, so I MUST, I simply MUST do it properly or not at all!Eventually, I calm down and write a short list of all the desirable functions of my controller, wondering if I've still got an imaginary job to go to in the morning:It should warn the beekeeper that fumes are about to be produced so that he can either walk away to a safe distance or put on a suitable mask.     It should control the temperature at which the oxalic acid powder is heated to so that it is not 'overcooked' or 'undercooked'.     It should tell the beekeeper if the device is still hot so that he does not try to add more powder too soon.    It should reassure the beekeeper that everything is working properly, or if there is a fault somewhere.Then looking at the device itself:It must have a fan to blow the fumes into the beehive.     The heating coil must produce enough heat to vaporise the powder reasonably quickly.     The heating coil should have a reasonable life expectancy, so should not be operated at too high a power.     All electrical cables must be tightly secured.     It must be properly tested to check for short circuits and leaks.Hopefully Brian will be in a better mood tomorrow.As far as the Arduino goes, the code to warn the beekeeper that the temperature of the pot is too high for refilling straight away would look something like this:while(heat > 100) {   heat = thermocouple.readThermocouple(CELSIUS);   lcd.clear();   lcd.setCursor(0,0); lcd.print(\"Please wait while\");   lcd.setCursor(0,1); lcd.print(\"the device cools\");   lcd.setCursor(0,2); lcd.print(\"to below 100\");lcd.print((char)223);lcd.print(\"C\");   lcd.setCursor(0,3);lcd.print(\"Probe Temp:\");lcd.print(heat);lcd.print((char)223);lcd.print(\"C.\");   tone(A2, 300, 100); // plays a 300 hz sound for 100ms   delay(3000);  }In this bit of code, the K type temperature sensor is being read and it's value is declared to be 'heat'. The LCD screen is then cleared and a message is printed to tell the beekeeper that the pot is too hot and that he must wait until it cools down. An alarm noise is broadcast every 3 seconds as the code loops. The controller will stay in this 'while' loop until the conditions of the loop are met ie. that the 'heat' is no longer greater than 100 \u00baC.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F15/6MAO/IIOWRD4X/F156MAOIIOWRD4X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2H/9TFP/IJ6CCFHN/F2H9TFPIJ6CCFHN.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Control of Hazardous Processes"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Originally, the prototyping board was born as a result of building a device for detecting methanol vapour around biodiesel production tanks. Basically, I got fed up with continually having to redesign one small circuit board for one small project so decided to make the board four times bigger and put all the features I could possibly need for all my current and future projects into it. The features are listed here:Detachable 4 x 20 LCD screen.    10 amp relays x 4.    USB sockets x 6.    Detachable Arduino Due or Uno.   Ability to attach 3rd part shields direct to the Arduino.   Optional hard wired detachable ATMEGA 328 chip.    Audio buzzer.    Audio amplifier circuits for high powered external speakers.    K - type thermocouple circuit for high temperature probes.    DC power regulator circuit.    Potentiometers x 4.    Push button switches x 3.    Various arrangements of empty pins in groups of 2,3 and 4 for general hacking.    5V, 9V and ground busses travelling all around the board.    Mounting holes for bolting into a box.  Double sided, gold plated board, with very durable pin sockets for re-working (The board MUST be double sided).Be warned, the board does use some very small surface mounted components (SMC), but the EEVblog video tutorial shows exactly how to do this. The advantages of using SMCs is that we can use the most up to date components and they save a huge amount of space so more of the board can be used for other things.Obviously, we could just buy a Thermocouple Amplifier MAX31855 breakout board from adafruit, or do what I do, which is to start of with one of these break out boards to test that my code works properly and then upgrade the board by hard soldering all the components on directly. The advantage with hard soldering is that the circuit is a lot more robust and resistant to vibration and general abuse out there in the real world. One thing to remember is that the MAX31855 chip has an internal reference temperature sensor and the chip does get slightly warm during use. Also, it needs to be positioned well away from any obvious heat sources on the board or otherwise, such as the LCD screen or the power regulators.Other things to be aware of are things like digital noise - is the coding too complicated? I had this problem with the 'one wire' system of temperature measurement - it gave too many errors.It's important that our thermocouple circuit does not fail due to vibration etc. and so too our audio amplifiers. These circuits are giving us temperature readings and audio warnings about the status of the device and so are important safety features.It is also important to me that the board is easy to use so, for this reason, I have annotated every single component with it's manufacturer's reference number or actual value so that when I come back to it a year or so later I can just read the text and solder in the components without having lots of other files or pages to read. The information is all on the board right in front of me.If you actually want your own prototyping board click here: http://www.freewebstore.org/goat-industries/", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FIZ/GTEM/IJ5U0L4T/FIZGTEMIJ5U0L4T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYJ/VMM1/IIOWR8CB/FYJVMM1IIOWR8CB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLA/07AK/IIOWR8CD/FLA07AKIIOWR8CD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHI/AL5Y/IIOWR8C8/FHIAL5YIIOWR8C8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2W/2SX9/IIOWRCYY/F2W2SX9IIOWRCYY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHE/XWRB/IIOWRD36/FHEXWRBIIOWRD36.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: The Arduino Hackable Prototyping Board"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Basically, this device works by putting 60 watts of power through a small home made heating coil wrapped around a small stainless steel pot. The oxalic acid is measured into the pot, the electricity is turned on and a blower pumps the fumes into the beehive. This device is electrically connected to the Arduino based control system so that the temperature can be monitored and the blower switched on at the right time. All we need is the temperature in the pot to reach the vaporisation (sublimation) temperature of oxalic acid point of oxalic acid: 175 degrees C.Additionally, the coil is insulated from the pot by one wrap of ceramic fibre. A second layer of fibre then goes around the outside of the coil and the whole assembly goes inside another, bigger, stainless steel tube or 'shroud' to protect it from the elements.Essential dimensions:Square plates: 86 x 86 x 3mm Stainless pot: OD 19, ID 16 x 25mm long Stainless shroud: OD 38, ID 34 x 80mm long 24 gauge kanthal 01 x 300mm long on 12 volt battery Bolts (not shown): 5mmThe power of the heater is given by the type of wire and it's length. When I assembled this heater I tested the amps going through the wire with a clamp meter and 12v car battery to check that there were no short circuits between the wire and the stainless components and also between the individual coils of wire touching each other.The coil wires get attached to insulated post terminals (not shown) which screw into the bottom most plate and the thermocouple wire (last photo) pushes in through a small 3mm hole in the centre of the bottom plate up as close to the underside of the vaporisation pot as possible, but not touching it.Winding the coils around the stainless pot is quite fiddly as the wires are very springy. With some practise, the wires can be held in the desired position and blasted with a bit of current to make them 'set' in the right place.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQE/Y5L5/IIOWR98M/FQEY5L5IIOWR98M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1H/Y2MF/IIOWR99L/F1HY2MFIIOWR99L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZB/E54Y/IIOWR9AO/FZBE54YIIOWR9AO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP3/VO7T/IIOWRBEG/FP3VO7TIIOWRBEG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Construction of the Vaporisation Device"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "A piece of cheese was vaporised at 180 degrees C to test the beehive fumigation machine.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F28/ZQPF/IIUKEFXJ/F28ZQPFIIUKEFXJ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Testing the Device With a Piece of Cheese"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Not content with producing a mere prototype I decided that the cheese test was so successful that the project should go one giant leap forwards. This involved adapted the old beehive stand on the left into a new vaporiser stand which would house the car battery on the base and have the circuit board in the front. I was so excited about my sound recordings from the NASA website that I concluded that the device needed it's own 40 watt sound system to broadcast the warning noises at high volume so that the beekeeper took them a little bit more seriously. The cabinet would therefore be fitted with speakers and an additional audio amplifier board fitted to the prototype board, if I can find space for it?To get the most out of the speakers, they needed to be fitted in their own little plywood boxes and screwed into the cabinet.The cabinet might, at first glance, seem a bit over the top but the electrical power draw when everything is running is quite high and so an old car battery was mounted in the bottom floor to provide enough energy for fumigating at least 13 beehives in one session.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5T/QWII/IIYUR590/F5TQWIIIIYUR590.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAW/VQ8G/IIYUR5CR/FAWVQ8GIIYUR5CR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL9/H776/IJ0A9CNP/FL9H776IJ0A9CNP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Making a Cabinet for the Machine"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "In a project like this, we can never have enough warning sounds, whether they be beeps, sirens or other special effects borrowed from the NASA website.Some really cool beeping noises can be made on the arduino uno using the following code that I wrote myself:// make beeping noises at increasing frequencies depending on temperature:  freq = startfrequency;  beeps = 0;  beepBeepThreshold = beepthreshold;while(beeps < numberofbeepsmax){  if(heat > beepBeepThreshold)  tone(A2, freq, 9);  // play a note from pin 2 at freq for 9ms  beeps++;  beepBeepThreshold = beepBeepThreshold + 10;  freq = freq + 100;  delay(10);}Earlier on in the code, the K type temperature sensor was read and it's value is declared to be 'heat'. The arduino now produces a series of beeping noises of increasing frequency, based on the temperature reading. When the device gets hot, a dramatic rapid series of loud beeps of increasing pitch are produced every second to indicate how hot it is without having to look at a screen.Unfortunately, the 'tone' function does not seem to work on an Arduino Due.For added drama, I thought that a second world war air raid siren and some NASA rocket launch audio might be fun. This was cobbled together in 'Fruity Loops' and windows movie maker (see video).I added a couple of audio boards to the project, one, the Adafruit Stereo 20W Class D Audio Amplifier - MAX9744 and two, the Adafruit Audio FX Sound Board - WAV/OGG Trigger with 16MB Flash. I wanted my home made bleeps and the NASA sound effects to be REALLY LOUD! Strangely, the bleeps ended up being much louder than the audio files, even though they were put through different channels of the same amp.

Finally the low-pass filter removes higher frequencies to remove noise from the signal and in combination with the notch filter only allows in the frequencies that are represented in an ECG signal.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: Determine What Filters and Amplifiers to Use"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The amplifier is required to have a gain of 1000 V/V and as it can be seen, the amplifier is made up of two stages. Therefore, the gain must be distributed evenly among the two stages, with K1 being the gain of the first stage and K2 being the gain of the second stage. We determined K1 to be 40 and K2 to be 25. These are acceptable values due to the fact that when multiplied together, a gain of 1000 V/V is obtained, 40 x 25 = 1000, and they are of comparable amount, with a variance of 15 V/V. Using these values for the gain, the proper resistances can then be computed. The following equations are used for these calculations:Stage 1 Gain: K1 = 1 + 2R2R1 (1) Stage 2 Gain: K2 = -R4R3 (2) We arbitrarily picked a value of R1, in this case it was 1 k\u2126, and then subsequently solved for the value of R2. Plugging in those previous values into the equation for the stage 1 gain, we get: 40 = 1 + 2R2*1000\u21d2R2 = 19,500 \u2126 It is important to ensure that when choosing the resistances, they are in the kOhm range because of the rule of thumb that the larger the resistor is, the more power is can safely dissipate without suffering damage. If the resistance is too small and there is too large of a current, there will be damage to the resistor and furthermore the circuit itself will not be able to function. Following the same protocol for stage 2, we arbitrarily picked a value of R3, 1 k\u2126, and then solved for R4. Plugging in the previous values into the equation for the stage 2 gain, we get: 25 = -R4*1000 \u21d2R4= 25000 \u2126 The negative sign is negated as resistances cannot be negative.

Set the function generator to output a Cardiac Waveform with a frequency of 1 kHz, a Vpp of 12.7 mV, and an offset of 0 V. This input should be to pin 3 of the operational amplifiers in the first stage of the circuit. The output of the amplifier, coming from pin 6 of the operational amplifier of the second stage, is displayed on channel 1 of the oscilloscope and the voltage peak-to-peak is measured and recorded. In order to ensure that the instrumentation amplifier has a gain of at least 1000 V/V, the voltage peak-to-peak should be at least 12.7 V.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2Y/1CIR/JB3ZLXGN/F2Y1CIRJB3ZLXGN.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Build Instrumentation Amplifier and Test It"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "The notch filter is required to remove 60 Hz noise from the biosignal. In addition to this requirement, because this filter does not need to include any further amplification, the quality factor is set to 1. As with the instrumentation amplifier, we first determined the values for R1, R2, R3, and C using the following design equations for a notch filter:R1= 1/(2Q\u23750C)R2= 2Q/(\u23750C) R3= R1R/(2R1 + R2)Q = \u23750/\u03b2\u03b2= \u2375c2 -\u2375c1 Where Q = quality factor \u23750= 2\u03c0f0= center frequency in rad/sec f0= center frequency in Hz \u03b2 = bandwidth in rad/sec \u2375c1, \u2375c2= cutoff frequencies (rad/sec)We arbitrarily picked a value of C, in this case it was 0.15 \u00b5F, and then subsequently solved for the value of R1. Plugging in the previous values listed of the quality factor, center frequency, and capacitance, we get: R1= 1/(2(1)(2\u03c060)(0.15x10-6))= 1105.25 \u2126As mentioned above when discussing the design of the instrumentation amplifier, it is still important to make sure that when solving for the resistances that they are in the kOhm range so no damage is done to the circuit. If when solving for the resistances, one is too small, a value should be altered, such as the capacitance, to ensure that this does not occur. Similarly to solving the equation for R1, R2 and R3can be solved: R2= 2(1)/[(2\u03c060)(0.15x10-6)]= 289.9 k\u2126  R3= (1105.25)(289.9x103)/[(1105.25) + (289.9x103)]= 1095.84 \u2126 Additionally, solve for the bandwidth in order to have it as a theoretical value to compare to the experimental value later: 1 = (2\u03c060)/\u03b2\u21d2\u03b2 = 47.12 rad/sec Once you know the resistance values build circuit on the breadboard.Only this stage of the circuit is to be tested at this point, so it should not be connected to the instrumentation amplifier.

The function generator is set to output a sinusoidal waveform with an initial frequency of 10 Hz, a Vpp of 1 V, and an offset of 0 V.

However, abnormal ventricular conduction is characterized by higher frequencies, typically above 70 Hz. Therefore, 150 Hz was chosen as the cutoff frequency in order to ensure that we can capture all frequencies, even the higher frequencies, while cutting off high frequency noise. In addition to the 150 Hz cutoff frequency, the quality factor, K, is set to 1 because no further amplification is required. We first determined the values for R1,R2, R3, R4, C1, and C2 using the following design equations for a low-pass filter:R1= 2/[\u2375c[aC2+sqrt([a^2 + 4b(K -1)]C2^2 - 4bC1C2)]]  R2= 1/[bC1C2R1\u2375c^2]   R3= K(R1+ R2)/(K -1)  when K > 1 R4= K(R1+R2)    C2 about 10/fc uF     C1 < C2[a2 + 4b(K -1)]4b  Where K = gain \u2375c= cutoff frequency (rad/sec) fc= cutoff frequency (Hz)  a = filter coefficient = 1.414214 b = filter coefficient = 1 Because the gain is 1, R3 is replaced by an open circuit and R4is replaced by a short circuit which makes it a voltage follower.

The DAQ Assistant takes the input signal, which is an analog voltage signal, either simulated by a function generator or received directly from a person hooked up to appropriately placed electrodes. It then takes this signal and runs it through an A/D converter with continuous sampling and parameters of 2000 samples to be read, a 1 kHz sampling rate and with max and min voltage values being 10V and -10V respectively. This acquired signal is then output on a graph so that it can be visually seen. It also takes this converted waveform and adds 5, to ensure it accounts for a negative offset and is then multiplied by 200 to make the peaks more distinct, larger and easier to analyze. It then determines the max and min value of the waveform within the given window of 2.5 seconds through the max/min operand. The max value calculated needs to be multiplied by a percentage that can be changed but is usually 90% (0.9). This value is then added to the min value and sent into the peak detect operand as the threshold. As a result every point of the waveform graph that exceeds this threshold is defined as a peak and saved as an array of peaks in the peak detector operator. This array of peaks is then sent to two different functions. One of these functions receives both the peak array and the waveform output by the max value operator. Within this function, dt, these two inputs are converted to a time value for each of the peaks. The second function consists of two index operators which take the location outputs of the peak detection function and indexes them separately to obtain the locations of the 0th peak and the 1st peak. The difference between these two locations is calculated by the minus operator and then multiplied by the time values obtained from the dt function. This outputs the period, or the time between two peaks in seconds. By definition, 60 divided by the period gives BPM. This value is then run through an absolute operand to make sure the output is always positive and is then rounded to the nearest whole number. This is the final step in calculating and finally outputting the heart rate onto the same screen as the waveform output.

In order to modify the circuit to comply with a human and produce a viable signal, the gain of the instrumentation amplifier must be reduced to a gain of 100. This is due to the fact that when connected to a person, there is an offset which then saturates the operational amplifier. By lowering the gain, this will reduce this issue. First, the gain of the first stage of the instrumentation amplifier is altered to a gain of 4 so that the overall gain is 100.

Therefore, the gain must be distributed evenly among the two stages, with K1 being the gain of the first stage and K2 being the gain of the second stage. We determined K1 to be 40 and K2 to be 25. These are acceptable values due to the fact that when multiplied together, a gain of 1000 V/V is obtained, 40 x 25 = 1000, and they are of comparable amount, with a variance of 15 V/V. Using these values for the gain, the proper resistances can then be computed. The following equations are used for these calculations:Stage 1 Gain: K1 = 1 + 2R2R1 (1) Stage 2 Gain: K2 = -R4R3 (2) We arbitrarily picked a value of R1, in this case it was 1 k\u2126, and then subsequently solved for the value of R2. Plugging in those previous values into the equation for the stage 1 gain, we get: 40 = 1 + 2R2*1000\u21d2R2 = 19,500 \u2126 It is important to ensure that when choosing the resistances, they are in the kOhm range because of the rule of thumb that the larger the resistor is, the more power is can safely dissipate without suffering damage. If the resistance is too small and there is too large of a current, there will be damage to the resistor and furthermore the circuit itself will not be able to function. Following the same protocol for stage 2, we arbitrarily picked a value of R3, 1 k\u2126, and then solved for R4.

The DAQ Assistant takes the input signal, which is an analog voltage signal, either simulated by a function generator or received directly from a person hooked up to appropriately placed electrodes. It then takes this signal and runs it through an A/D converter with continuous sampling and parameters of 2000 samples to be read, a 1 kHz sampling rate and with max and min voltage values being 10V and -10V respectively. This acquired signal is then output on a graph so that it can be visually seen. It also takes this converted waveform and adds 5, to ensure it accounts for a negative offset and is then multiplied by 200 to make the peaks more distinct, larger and easier to analyze. It then determines the max and min value of the waveform within the given window of 2.5 seconds through the max/min operand. The max value calculated needs to be multiplied by a percentage that can be changed but is usually 90% (0.9). This value is then added to the min value and sent into the peak detect operand as the threshold. As a result every point of the waveform graph that exceeds this threshold is defined as a peak and saved as an array of peaks in the peak detector operator. This array of peaks is then sent to two different functions. One of these functions receives both the peak array and the waveform output by the max value operator. Within this function, dt, these two inputs are converted to a time value for each of the peaks. The second function consists of two index operators which take the location outputs of the peak detection function and indexes them separately to obtain the locations of the 0th peak and the 1st peak. The difference between these two locations is calculated by the minus operator and then multiplied by the time values obtained from the dt function. This outputs the period, or the time between two peaks in seconds. By definition, 60 divided by the period gives BPM. This value is then run through an absolute operand to make sure the output is always positive and is then rounded to the nearest whole number. This is the final step in calculating and finally outputting the heart rate onto the same screen as the waveform output. As the end this is what the block diagram should look like the first image.After completing the block diagram, if you run the program you should get the output pictured.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQT/7ZRN/JB3ZLY0J/FQT7ZRNJB3ZLY0J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC9/WUDD/JB3ZLXDA/FC9WUDDJB3ZLXDA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5H/86K7/JB3ZLVZL/F5H86K7JB3ZLVZL.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Code LabView to Analyze Components of ECG Signal and Calculate the Heartbeat"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "Now for the fun part! Combining your beautiful circuit and the LabView program to acquire a real ECG and calculate its heart rate.  In order to modify the circuit to comply with a human and produce a viable signal, the gain of the instrumentation amplifier must be reduced to a gain of 100. This is due to the fact that when connected to a person, there is an offset which then saturates the operational amplifier. By lowering the gain, this will reduce this issue. First, the gain of the first stage of the instrumentation amplifier is altered to a gain of 4 so that the overall gain is 100. Then, using equation 1, R2is set to 19.5 k\u2126, and R1is found as follows:4 = 1 + 2(19,500)R1\u21d2R1= 13 k\u2126 Then, the instrumentation amplifier is modified by changing the resistance of R1to 13 k\u2126 as shown in step 2 on the previously built breadboard. The entire circuit is connected and the circuit can be tested using LabView. The Agilent E3631A DC Power Supply powers the operational amplifiers with an output of +15 V and -15 V going to pins 4 and 7. The ECG electrodes are connected to the subject with the positive lead (G1) going to the left ankle, the negative lead (G2) going to the right wrist, and the ground (COM) going to the right ankle. The human input should be to pin 3 of the operational amplifiers in the first stage of the circuit with the positive lead connected to pin 3 of the first operational amplifier and the negative lead connected to pin 3 of the second operational amplifier. The ground connects to the ground of the breadboard. The output of the amplifier, coming from pin 6 of the low-pass filter, is attached to the DAQ board. Be sure to be very still and quiet and you should get an output in LabView that looks similar to the one in the picture.This signal is obviously far more noisy than the perfect signal simulated by the function generator. As a result your heart rate will jump around a lot but should fluctuate with a range of 60-90 BPM.  And there you have it!

Family members can create a lot of noise so if you feel they are interfering with your work, try closing some doors and windows and ask them politely to keep it down.  Its a good idea to have things set up, and record when there's no one around. When choosing a room its best to look for:Four wallsMedium sized. A bedroom or small garage is good. Something bigger than a simple bathroom.A carpeted floor would be ideal, since it would absorb most of the sound. Concrete or tiles floors can also work, depending on the type.Wood doorsThings to avoid:Try to avoid hardwood floors, as they will reflect sounds too much.Glass windows can also mess with acoustics. If you have glass windows with fabric curtains, closing them might help the acoustics. (Plastic curtains might also help, but they still reflect sound to an extent.If you have a closet, the doors might also affect the acoustics if they occupy a large part of the room, but most of them don't have a significant effect.

Although a specialized room would be ideal, with a few tweaks, any regular room can become a quick recording room.First of all, you can reduce the room's contribution to your recording by keeping away from the walls and by improvising screens using sleeping bags, pillows, blankets or duvets behind and to the sides of the recording artist. The mic picks up both direct sound from the speaker and reflected sound from the room. This will \"deaden\" the sound of the room when it comes to recording. It's important to remember that hardwood floors and concrete walls make A LOT of noise! Sound waves hit those walls dead on and then rebound back into your microphone! And then they do it again! This is a common mistake among amateurs, as the room can seem quiet to you, while the mike picks up all sorts of noises you wouldn't suspect. Some tips to prep a room for recording:Hardwood floors reflect sounds too much. If you have hardwood floors, it would be a good idea to put a towel or rug in a place where the floor is exposed. You might just have to put one rug or towel in the middle of the room, since this is usually enough to prevent the sound being reflected too much.Glass windows can also reflect sound. If you have fabric curtains, try closing them, since they might help reduce sound reflection. If you do not have curtains, putting a towel over the window or covering most of it will stop sound reflection.If there is too much noise coming from the rest of the house, even though the door is closed, try putting a towel under or close to the door, since air can still pass below the door, sound might also pass.If you have concrete walls and are willing to spend a bit more time, you can put two or three foam shapes on the walls, to try to distribute sound reflection, or at least reduce it.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ7/B2MF/FUI0P1XG/FJ7B2MFFUI0P1XG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Setting Up Your Room"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Some of the following tips are from Albino Black Sheep member AvidLebonThe most important equipment you'll need is software and a microphone. Microphone:The microphone is the essential piece of equipment and your main tool. I don't have much experience in buying microphones myself, since I usually use someone else's. :DSome tips on choosing a microphone:Price is NOT consistant with quality for sure! A $30 average brand microphone might actually be better than a $90 brand name microphone, since these can have many unwanted or unnecessary options and features that can simply confuse the user.Avoid packages with little or no decoration. Chances are, if they didn't put that much effort into making it attractive, they didn't put much effort in the mic itself! (This is true for any piece of technology, I'm sure most of you agree with me!)The standard computer mic doesn't cut it for quality recording, and has a lot of 'wahwah' noise. I guess they could do if you want to do something quick and dirty, but if you want to make a high quality recording, its best to invest a little on a microphone.Be sure to check that a microphone is compatible with your computer. Some regular mikes have options for plugging it into multiple devices, but some can only be used with speakers. And you certainly don't wanna be surprised to find that your new $100 microphone is not compatible with your computer!Yokozuna says: Most good mics are not compatible with computers, they would have an XLR out.

It takes longer to record twice, but is good quality on the cheapSoftware:You'll want to test out and learn these programs before you do your actual recording session, especially if you have other people doing voice overs with you. There are many free audio programs for you to choose from such as :Audacity - I only use this program, since it has proven to be  more than enough for ALL of my audio needs. I've used it for music, sound effects, and general audio effects and editing. It's got a pretty full arsenal, and some good voice filters. I highly recommend this program.Goldwave -You also have the option of purchasing audio software, though most of the time these just have more filters and special effects.

Chances are these sounds can't be fixed in the recording. To solve this problem, use a Pop ShieldA Pop Shield is a tool you put between the mic and the person recording. A Pop shield can be compared to a water filter. Like the water filter holds anything in the water that's too big or solid, like iron bits from the faucet, the pop shield filters the sound. Pop noises like P or B make you spit out saliva and lots of  air. The pop shield holds these unnecessary noises and only lets the sound through. You can buy a Professional Pop Shield.......Or make your own for free!!:To make a Pop Shield you'll need:Wire Coat HangerStocking or one of those black or brown socks that are really thin.Simply wrap the stocking around the coat hanger. You can give the coat hanger an oval shape if you find it more comfortable. To use, just hold it between your mouth and the mic.

If you're gonna make a video outdoors, its a good idea to record audio with a separate device and then intertwine the audio with the video.Professionals use special microphones that cancel out undesired noises, but unfortunately chances are you can't afford one of these, so you probably wont be able to totally  prevent wind from appearing in the audio in very windy areas. A pop shield might help reduce wind interference. Make a Pop Shield around the microphone, or if you have some extra cash, use some foam around it.

(Thanks Yokozuna!)Keep the mike at 45 degrees from you.Keep the mike away from fluorescent-light fixtures, computer air vents, and any other sources of noise you might have. (You might not notice it, but it will probably show up in recording as an annoying pitch sound)If you have noise that you can't trace to a source, it may be that the mike is picking up vibration from the surface the stand is sitting on. Try setting the stand on a surface that isn't vibrating, or try putting a cushion of some sort - maybe a mouse pad - between the vibrating surface and the mike stand.Try to keep the microphone away from your computer tower, as that itself makes noise.Are your computer's speakers turned off? If they are on, you can get feedback (a painful screeching noise) during your recording with a microphone. If you're on a PC, your speakers can also be disabled in the Windows Volume Control, if you cannot easily turn them off.From Yokozuna: While this may seem a bit cheesy, you normally want to smile as you read, it generally makes the audio sound \"warmer\"", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FE5/4Q9O/FUI0P1WN/FE54Q9OFUI0P1WN.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Actual Recording"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "A little piece of portable awesomeness, the Portable Voice-over Booth is a must for every artist or videomaker who is truly dedicated to his work, and has some spare cash.It's a fairly useful little box, that provides enough space for comfortable voice recording and can be neatly folded down to take anywhere.A decent laptop, an audio interface, and a microphone allow you to record and deliver voice tracks from almost anywhere.

You need to cut 2 holes in the rear middle chamber. This is to help take the rear baffle off if you need to get into it. It also allows for ventilation if you put an internal amp in that chamber. The holes will be 1\" big and will be place approximately 17\" from either side and 1 9/16\" down. You will also want to glue on the rear pieces (12 x 3 1/8) to either side of the baffle.For the front baffle, you will want to cut out the tweeter hole first (before gluing anything). Measure approximately 5 25/32\" over (both sides) and 1 9/16 down on your front baffle (35.5 x 3 1/8) and cut a 2 3/4\" hole. Then round this over with a 1/4 roundover bit. Now glue the rest of the front baffle on (12 x 3 1/8) which will be placed on the rear of the front baffle (opposite of the roundover). Measure again 5 25/32 over and 1 9/16 down and cut out a 45mm hole for the rear of the tweeter. At this time you will cut the woofer holes out at 2 1/4\" and 9 1/4\" over and 1 9/16\" down. The holes are 2 1/2. Once this is complete, you can roundover your woofer holes with a 3/8\" roundover bit.Now we need to start bracing the box. The best thing to do at this time is to temporarily put the front baffle on to line up the braces. Do not glue the front baffle on. Take your two 3 1/2\" braces out and glue them at 12\". They will slide right against the the front baffle that is sticking out 1/4\" higher.You now have three boxes, 2 speaker boxes on either side and a center box for crossover components and or an amplifier. Take the four 3\" pieces and glue them on either side of the inside of the speaker boxes. These will slide all the way against the front baffle.Now we need something to screw the speakers to. For this we will sure the four 3/4\" by 1/2\" pieces. Glue the on the inner side, in the rear. They should be 1/2\" from the edge (ie line up with the 3\" piece you just glued in). When you assemble, this is what you will screw your screws in.The last two braces (1\") can go wherever you want. I placed them approximately, 1.5\" from the rear of the enclosure at 5\" and 7\" from the side. This should be near the tweeter hole. Try to save room so you can still get to the screws on the back of the woofer.Now attach your speakers. I attach the woofers first, then the tweeter. If you plan to externally power this, run some binding posts. These typically go in the middle compartment, which means you will need to run a hole for the speaker wire. Once you have it run, solder it to the speakers. And fill the hole with either self expanding gorilla glue or hot glue.

Update June 15th 2013: I am creating a v3.0 and v4.0, simple and complicated respectively. If anyone would like to suggest features for me to explore in these models I am willing to try to incorporate them. Theoretically one or both of these may become a kit version. Update December 6, 2012 I am in the process of remaking the sonic with plumbing parts and attiny85's. The version I have developed uses 2 AAA batteries for power and should theoretically be louder. It also includes the TV-b-gone clone circuit. I am stuck in a coding problem to do with timers but hopefully soon I will have a new set of instructions. I am posting a process image above. UPDATE! I have found a simple solution to a problem that I have been contacted about several times regarding the sound circuit. The trick is to remove all the wires but the two for power from the programmer before testing the device out. I have two people who I am very close to who enjoy the show Dr. Who. For both of them I have made sonic screwdrivers to accompany their (mild) obsession. Both of the sonic screwdrivers make the proper sound and light up using a UV light however the more complicated one also turns TV's on and off, has an mp3 player embedded in it, uses a rechargeable battery, has a laser, has an FM transmitter and also shakes when activated. This instructable covers the construction of the simplified model to get a basic understanding however I include at the end a section on how I added features to the more complicated version as well as ideas for additional features I considered adding. Attached to this step is a video of my first sonic screwdriver turning on a tv. The buzzing sound that is heard that should not be there is due to the vibration motor coming slightly loose. It is only noticeable within a few inches of the handle, past that the proper sound is heard loud and clear. I do not like my props to feel cheap or breakable so both versions were made with metal handles and feature glass marbles as the light end. The amount of plastic exposed to the exterior of the sonic screwdriver was kept to a minimum so it appears as if it is a tool worthy of traveling the stars, opening doors, making cabinets and general tom foolery.", "title": "Working Sonic Screwdriver", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Working-Sonic-Screwdriver/", "section": "costumes", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "At its heart a sonic screwdriver model only HAS to light up and make the sound in my opinion.

First before we go deep into woofers, mid rangers, mid-bass, full rangers and all the other yummy things we need to understand some words!1. Frequency Range-range of wave frequencies. It most often refers to either a range of frequencies in sound or a range of frequencies in electromagnetic radiation, which includes light and radio waves. blah blah blah.. What does it mean?!Well Frequency Range is a scale for sound!  Sound comes in waves and there are different waves/frequency in the world! sound wave is measured by Hertz, Hzan example of a Frequency Range would be110-20k HzThe lower the minimum,left number the deeper the bass can get; The higher the maximum,right number the higher the tone can get.2. dB-decibeldecibel is a logarithmic unit of measurement that expresses the magnitude of a physical quantity (usually power or intensity) relative to a specified or implied reference level. Since it expresses a ratio of two quantities with the same unit, it is a dimensionless unit. A decibel is one tenth of a bel, a seldom-used unit.Gah! So much. All you need to know is that the higher the decibel [or dB] the louder the speaker can be!

Pick the right size crimp terminal rings: The crimp ends should be just large enough for the bungee cord to fit through, and the screws that hold the lugs onto the shell should fit through the rings.The two bungee cords will eventually end up as 8 total pieces. Four will mount to the four mounting holes of the speaker.  The other four will be mounted to the magnet using the hose clamp.It is handy to make a reference template from one of the drum heads to position the speaker.  Place the drum shell on top of the head.  Mark four points on the head that line up with the mounting holes for the lugs.  Remove the shell, and use a ruler to draw two lines through the center, connecting opposite marks in an \"X\".  Center the speaker on the X and align the speaker's mounting holes with the lines. When it is centered, trace around the speaker.  Keep this reference template head under the speaker and shell for the rest of this step (3).  We will use this template again in step 5.First cut the two bungee cords in half. By folding them, you can get the midpoint without measuring.  Remove the hooks.   Each piece should have a staple or crimp thing that was used to keep it from slipping through the hook.  Slip each of the pieces through the mounting holes in the speaker. They should hold. If not, use a washer to make the hole smaller, or find some other way to attach them.Next, remove the insulators from 12 of the crimp on terminals.  This is safe, since we're not using them for electricity, just for their mechanical properties.  Slide one crimp terminal over the end of each of the bungee cords.  With the speaker centered in the drum shell, adjust the crimp rings so the ring ends just touch the shell without stretching the cord, and crimp them in place.  You should have just under an inch of cord between the speaker and the crimp. Cut off the remaining bungee cord to use for the second set.  Crimp a ring onto each of the four pieces.  Clamp the rings onto the edge of the speaker magnet using the hose clamp. Tighten the hose clamp until it is close, and slide the rings between the magnet and the clamp.  Make sure that they are aligned with the speakers mounting holes, then tighten the hose clamp.  (alternatively, you could just clamp the ends of the bungee under the hose clamp)Slip the last four crimp rings onto the ends of the bungee cords.  Adjust them the same as before, with the tip of the ring just touching the shell without stretching the cord.  Crimp them in place and cut off any remaining cord blocking the holes of the rings.Now is a good time to test the shock mounting system, so you can make any adjustments while there is still plenty of room inside the shell.

Also make sure that the components won't interfere with the lugs or the shock mount system.Mark the center of each hole on the template, and tape it down temporarily.

You may want to pad the transformer inside the container with a scrap of foam, cotton balls, or a plastic shopping bag so it doesn't rattle around inside. The connections on the transformer will be less likely to come loose if the transformer does not move.Solder in the leads for the speaker and label them. Wait to solder them to the speaker terminals until after you have mounted the speaker in step 7. Circuit ExplanationThe configuration of the coils can be changed by the rotary switch (S1).   Position 1 Single:   A single coil of the speaker is used (4ohms), both 1/4\" jacks are wired in parallel with the coil.Position 2 Series:  Two coils are wired in series(8ohms), with the two 1/4\" jacks wired in parallel.Position 3 Parallel: Two coils are wired in parallel (2ohms), with the two 1/4\" jacks wired in parallel.Position 4 Damping: Coil A is normalled to the 100ohm potentiometer, which will electromagnetially dampen coil B. When a 1/4\" plug is plugged in, the potentiometer is disconnected, and the input directly drives coil A.   Coil B is wired in parallel with the 1/4\" output jack.In all positions, the output then passes through the phase flip switch, through a -20db pad, to one side of the transformer.  The transformer's secondary outputs through the XLR jack.  (The pins on the XLR jack are labeled.)The filtered ground can be lifted by opening S4.

You want to leave a strip all the way around that is slightly thicker than the shell of the drum. (if you cut out the whole head, the ring will just slip around the outside of the shell)  The strip of head sits on the shell, and the rim keeps it tight.To help me make a nice smooth cut, I used a washer.  The difference between the inside radius and the outside radius of the washer was a little more than the thickness of the shell.       With the metal ring of the head facing up, set the washer flat inside the head, against the ring. Put the tip of the knife inside the washer.  The washer will roll against the ring of the head, and keep the blade at the right distance.Place the drum head \"donut\" on a corner of your grill cloth and cut out a square just a little larger. Then cut off the corners. Take a needle and thread and sew some temporary holders in place. Connect each of the eight points to the point across from it by tying off the thread. This will temporarily hold the fabric while it is sewn on.Take more thread and stitch around the edge.  Roll up the cloth a bit to give it something to hold onto (grill cloth is a loose weave).  Only stitch the cloth on the back side of the head, _not the front_. This stitch is similar to the way you would make the webbing of a \"dream catcher.\"  NativeTech.org has better instruction on the technique.  For each stitch, instead of going around a ring of vine or metal, you stitch through the grill cloth.  This thread won't really take any tension on the cloth until you get half way around the circle.  When you make it once around, overlap a bit.  Go back to the beginning, and tighten the stitches by pulling the thread with your fingers. You should be able to stretch the cloth a little and get it nice and even on the front side.   Then stitch a second round.  It is fine to tie off the first round and use a second piece of thread.  This time stitch in between your previous stitches, stitching around both the cloth and the thread of the first round. Tighten the second round, and tie off your thread.  Check your work. The front face should be nice and even, and the cloth should overlap the back side of the metal ring.  When all is good, you can cut and remove the temporary thread on the crossing over the middle.Repeat this step for the second head.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZI/MASY/F7YPXGTL/FZIMASYF7YPXGTL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUV/JS6K/F7YPXGTE/FUVJS6KF7YPXGTE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5N/97J6/F7YPXGT6/F5N97J6F7YPXGT6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUW/OE91/F7YPXGTH/FUWOE91F7YPXGTH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX8/6AU1/F7YPXGTF/FX86AU1F7YPXGTF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOG/6KJY/F7YPXGTG/FOG6KJYF7YPXGTG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F50/QGN2/F7YPXGTI/F50QGN2F7YPXGTI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSA/D33H/F7YPXGTD/FSAD33HF7YPXGTD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOE/ES5L/F7YPXGTW/FOEES5LF7YPXGTW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Cosmetics"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "Put the grill cloth heads back on the drum with the rims and T-rods.

Sound isn't an object.  Your boom box isn't firing little particles of magic sound dust to tickle your ears with M.C. Hammer.  Instead, sound is the transfer of energy.A source (such as the speaker on you boom box) is receiving electrical energy and converting it into mechanical energy.  If you'll kindly place your fingers against your throat and scream the phrase, \"someone's already made a movie about a giant singing plant,\" you'll feel that mechanical energy in the form of vibrations.  You'll also have noticed those vibrations when you stand really close to a drum set or those cheap speakers your ex-girlfriend blasts Smash Mouth on.  That mechanical vibration acts like a piston pushing particles forward when it moves outward and pulling particles backwards when it pulls in.  Like I said, sound isn't an object; it is a transfer of energy.  Those particles are not hurling towards your ears.  The first particle touches the next particle and moves it a bit.  That particle moves the next particle a little bit, and so on until that movement, that energy, reaches your ear.  How fast those particles transfer energy (the speed of sound) is determined by what type of particle it is.  In air, sound moves at 343 meters per second.  In your secret underwater sea lab it moves at 1533 meters per second (I won't tell anyone).  I know you implicitly understand this, because you're super smart, but small sources move a small number of particles and big sources move a big number of particles.  If the mechanical vibration is small (if the piston only moves a short distance), it doesn't transfer much energy to the particles so the sound is small.  If your speaker is really athump'n (the piston moves a large distance) it is transferring large amounts of energy and it produces large sound.  One last note on the concept of sound, we say sound is a wave.  But it isn't one of those up and down waves like a jump rope or those sine graphs your algebra teacher makes you draw.  It is a back and forth sort of wave featuring a series of particles pressed really close together and particles spread far apart.  If you stretch a good slinky out on the ground and give it a push (a push not a wiggle! a push I said!) you'll see another example of this type of wave.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: Theory: What Is Sound"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Signal sources: 8-track player, cassette player, AM radio, mp3 player, what have you (with possibly the exception of a record player) all work on the same principle.  They read a code and send out impulses of electricity, the electrical impulse transfers energy through wires to an electromagnetical transducer (speaker driver) and sound is produced.  It's like ants in an anthill.  The anthill is the signal source sending ants (electricity) out to a picnic (the speaker).  We won't concern ourselves with the politics of anthills or explaining exactly the movement of ants.  We just have to answer two questions to build a good speaker: How many ants reach the picnic in certain amount of time? And what are the ants doing at the picnic?How many ants reach the picnic in a certain amount of time is different than asking how fast the ants go.  Ants basically go just one speed.  What I'm referring to is how close together the ants are.  Did they come out of the anthill one right after the other?  Or did they wait a couple seconds between each ant?  This refers to the frequency of ants.  If the ants are frequent visitors (one right after another) to our picnic (speaker) the sound produced will be a high frequency sound (high pitched) like the squeal of teenage girls... the kind of noise that shatters glass and ear drums alike.  If the ants don't go by very often they are said to be a low frequency and the sound they produce is a low thumping base.Frequency is extremely important in designing speakers.  Some materials and sizes are just better for producing different sounds.  You'll notice speakers that produce low sounds (sub woofers) are really big, while high sounds are made by little speakers.  This Instructable only describes one size of speaker that is going to be doing its best to produce all frequencies of sound... but a better system can be made when the electrical impulses (ants) are filtered so that the low sounds go to a big speaker and the high sounds are directed to a small speaker.Now what's happening at our picnic?  Ignore the young couple that are rolling around and just focus on the ants.  They are picking up bits of food right?  In speaker terms the electrical impulses are producing magnetic impulses.  Part of the speaker is becoming an electromagnet in a certain frequency determined by the frequency of the ants.Holy Lorenz force Batman! How does electricity produce a magnet?  Electricity and magnetism are closely related.  In fact, if you spin magnets around something that conducts electricity (such as a bit of copper wire) you can produce electricity... but you knew that... you're smart, it's called a generator.  The reverse is also true.  If you make electricity spin in a circle (by wrapping wire into a tight round coil) it produces a magnetic field.The signal source is reading a code and sending electrical impulses at a frequency.  The electrical impulses travel down a wire to a coil of wires where it produces a magnetic field that is changing at the same frequency.  To produce mechanical energy we now simply move a permanent magnet near our electromagnet.  As the electromagnet turns on and off, it will be moving the permanent magnet back and forth.  Back and forth, by definition is mechanical energy.  If these magnets are glued down to something like the bottom of a cup, the cup bottom will be moving at the frequency sent by the signal source.  You will feel the cup bottom vibrate and sound will be produced.

Lower left is the mounting ring that is bolted on the motor body with two (inhexc head) screws (still in the relevant holes) and has got 3 threaded holes for the 3 (Philips head) screws (middle of pic) that holds the gearbox to the mounting ring.Overall, it's a pretty OK gear box, but if you need to dismantle the gear box for any reason, consider adding a tiny amount of grease suitable for nylon and steel, if it was assembled with as little grease as mine was, but don't overdo it, or you'll slow down the motor too much - just a thin film of grease on each gear wheel will make it run more silent, while too much will just sit there and do no good.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FVH/DTLO/IDUQSR87/FVHDTLOIDUQSR87.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Components of the Gear Box"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Just for those who like a better look at the parts, here's the motor housing with the gear wheel towards you and showing the two threaded holes for the mounting ring.

Let's lube up the thing and see if that will help.Adding a tiny drop of Super Lube(TM), a thin synthetic lube loaded with microscopic PTFE/Teflon balls, to the (bronze) output bushing and powering up brought the sunshine indoors, as the motor now ran with no trace of shreaking, loaded, unloaded and over the entire voltage range (3V..24V).As an added precaution, I gave the other end of the axle a small drop as well (Murphy hits those who doesn't prepare ;))See photos for the exact places to lube.
