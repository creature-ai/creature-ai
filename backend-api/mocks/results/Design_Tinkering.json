[{"category": "technology", "description": "Hey everybody! Please bear with me as this is my first instructable. I apologize in advance for not taking enough photos as I was building it, but it's relatively simple and can be customized to meet anyone's creative desires!\nMy inspiration for this project came from my vintage 60's suitcase record player. It has a great old-timey sound, but is mono, has poor sound quality and has seen better days! So I set about to build a replacement. The goal was to build a durable, decent quality portable stereo turntable system. Keep in mind that it's a bit of a brute, weighing in at approximately 30 lbs, but it is portable haha.\u00a0\nI had a lot of fun making this and managed to keep the cost down to roughly $100. If you've already got a turntable to use, then that will save a few bucks right off the bat. I paid $20 for mine from the classified ads in the paper, which was fair for a functional player. I used a Sony PS-LX520 Linear Tracking table, which is fairly heavy actually. The lighter the TT you can get, the better!\nAny feedback would be greatly appreciated! Hopefully you enjoy this as much as I did!\nThings you'll need:\n-Turntable\n-Amplifier (I used a kit amp from my local electronics hobby shop)\n-Project box to put your kit amp in (optional)\n-Pre amp (I used a Pyle model from the same hobby shop)\n-Various hardware (Hinges, latches, etc. I salvaged a few of these parts from an old briefcase)\n-Self tapping wood screws (I used #6 brass screws of various lengths)\n-Magnetic pop-outs for hinged door on front (optional)\n-Self adhesive foam insulation\n-Wood (I used 1x3 pine for the sides, front and back, and 1/2\" birch for the top and bottom)\n-Speaker terminals\n-RCA connectors/cables\n-Wire clips (Optional)\n-Wire\n-Whatever else you want to make it unique!\nTools you'll need:\n-Drill\n-Saw (Or you can get the wood cut at your local Home Depot, which is what I did)\n-Soldering iron/solder\n-Heat shrink tubing or electrical tape\n-Square\n-Tape measure\n-Assorted screwdrivers\n-Awl", "title": "Suitcase Turntable (With Built in Amp and Pre Amp)", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Suitcase-Turntable-With-built-in-amp-and-pre-amp/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "This instructable is just a general guide. It's always a good idea to make some drawings and figure out all of your dimensions before you start buying everything.\nI would recommend getting the amp, pre amp and turntable of your choice before even thinking about designing your case. Just remember that the bigger your TT and amp, the bigger the case you'll need to build. I bought a stereo kit amp that puts out 20W per channel and a project box to enclose it and mount the speaker and RCA connectors.\nOnce you've decided on your equipment, you can better gauge your case dimensions. I left enough room to have about 1 1/2\" on both sides and back of the TT and about 3\" room in front of it so I could fit the amp and pre amp on the inside of the front panel. The extra clearance on the sides and back is for the foam insulation strips. They will cushion Your TT during transport. I also left some space above and put a couple additional strips on the inside of the top of the case. Once you've got all of your dimensions figured out, you can go get the wood.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FCF/50K0/HE7DAXWW/FCF50K0HE7DAXWW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Plan It Out!!!"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Now that you've got all of your wood cut, you can start assembling it all. I glued all of my pieces together, but you can screw them or do both if you like. Just make sure to mark and pre drill all of your holes. For the hinged front panel, I glued two 1x3\" pieces of pine together, and then had to plane the top inside edge down a bit and smooth it with sandpaper to clear the top when it closed. You may or may not have to do this depending on how much clearance you make. I'm by no means an expert when it comes to wood working, so don't judge me please! Haha.\nI first glued the two sides and back of the 1x3\" pine together and then glued them to the top and bottom pieces. Then I attached the front panel with small hinges at the bottom, and hinged the top and bottom halves of the case together at the rear. I attached the magnetic pop outs to the inside of the top half and the metal washers for them to the inside of the front panel (You can see them in the first pic).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWW/05QC/HE7DAY0R/FWW05QCHE7DAY0R.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFA/FNUE/HE7DAY0U/FFAFNUEHE7DAY0U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNY/QO1J/HE7DAY13/FNYQO1JHE7DAY13.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Glue or Screw Your Wood!"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "This step is complete preference. I chose to use some oak coloured stain, and then applied it to a cloth and rubbed it on (two coats), then brushed on two coats of semi-gloss Varathane. You may want to do this before you glue the wood, but it's just as easy after too.\u00a0\nOnce your paint or stain dries, you can mount your outside hardware. I used sliding latch locks to hold the front panel secure, since the handle will be going on here after. Whatever latch you use, just make sure it will hold the weight of everything when you transport it!\nI also put on some brass corners just to give it a sort of antique look. If you decide to do this, a good way to keep the wood from splitting when you nail the corners on is to cut the head off of a nail that is the same size as the ones you are using and use it in your drill to make pilot holes for the nails. Then give the pointed end of your nails a little tap with the hammer before you drive them in.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FL7/28RS/HE7DAY3P/FL728RSHE7DAY3P.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Stain/paint"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "If you buy a kit amp, it will come with instructions on how to solder it all together. I then made some holes in the back of a project box for the speaker binding posts and DC jack, and two holes in the side for the RCA connectors and two in the front for the volume knobs and then put my amp in and soldered all of the connections to the binding posts and RCA connections. Be sure to check that your amp and pre amp will clear and fit inside with the turntable when the front panel is closed before you mount them to the panel. I had to drill some holes right through the front panel to mount my carry handle. If you go right through, you'll need to do this before you mount your amp and pre amp. Make sure the handle mounting screws will be able to hold the weight of the case! My pre amp didn't have any mounting holes, so I just stuck some adhesive velcro to the bottom and attached it that way. I cut and shortened the RCA cables that connect the amp to the pre amp, since they are just an inch away from each other.\nI then screwed a few wire clips along the inside of the box just to keep the RCA cables and ground wire from the TT clean and neatly against the side.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F1E/LEDK/HE7DAYD2/F1ELEDKHE7DAYD2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3V/WPO7/HE7DAYFC/F3VWPO7HE7DAYFC.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Assemble and Mount Your Amp, Preamp and Carry Handle"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "The thickest insulating foam I could find was 1/2\", so I had to double it up to make a snug fit around my turntable.

To me, this value is too large and results in a tone that is unusably dark when the tone knob is all the way rolled off. For this build, I opted for a Jupiter .022 capacitor. These capacitors are similar in tone to the vintage caps found in tweed fender amps. I always check the value of the capacitors I install, even in guitars, to ensure they are as close to spec as possible. I would also recommend installing head shrink on the leads of the capacitor. You don't want the leads of the capacitor getting squished against the back of a pot once installed in the guitar. This could cause a short circuit and no signal to pass through. A note on \"tone\" capacitors:I have experimented A LOT with different capacitor values and different types of capacitors both new and NOS. In my opinion, the type of capacitor and value makes more a difference than brand or age. People tend to go nuts for old Sprague Black Beauties but a lot of that is hype. I have a bunch in my stash and I have never left them in a guitar for more than a day. You can't just put those caps in your guitar and expect it to sound like a '59 Burst...My favorite capacitors are NOS Mallory capacitors. Sozo makes good modern day replicas. The value is up to you but I prefer .015uf in humbucker equipped guitars and .022uf with single coils. NOS Sprague Vitamin Q capacitors are also great sounding. They are very smooth and more transparent sounding than the Mallory caps. I like the Mallory caps because they cause a subtle increase in the mid-range when you roll the tone off which gives you a fat, vocal-like tone especially when overdriven.

It's small size makes it ideal in a practice space, on a small stage, or for use as a recording amp in a home or project studio. The single volume knob allows for warm, clear tones at lower levels and aggressive overdriven tones at higher levels -- all at a moderate volume!This amp was designed around a single tube developed by GE in the early 1960\u2019s under the brand name \u201cCompactron.\u201d Compactron tubes have multiple amplifier sections in one bottle. The tube in the Percolator has two triodes and one sharp cut-off pentode. That\u2019s the same topology as the Fender Champ, but in one bottle! This tube was never intended to be used in an audio circuit (it was originally designed for use in various parts of a TV circuit), but it works and sounds great in a guitar amplifier. Since this tube is rarely, if ever, seen in guitar amps, it offers a rather unique tone. Compactrons were developed in a time of fast technological growth. In the early 1960\u2019s transistors were becoming more stable and practical for use in more demanding circuits. They also were much smaller and didn't require as much power (via heating filaments). The tube market was being challenged and threatened by this new solid state competitor. The GE corporation (which was one of, if not the most prolific tube developers in the world at the time) was well invested in their miniature tube line and wasn't too interested in making the transition to transistor development. So to compete with transistors and give tubes a few more years in the market, the engineers at GE developed the Compactron that could take the place of several tubes with just one bottle. It was the tube equivalent to the integrated circuit. They were mostly designed for use in the color TV market, but some of them did find their way into radios and hifi amps. Ampeg even used a Compactron in some of their preamp circuits. GE made a big push to promote and use these tubes in their products, but eventually transistors did win the technology battle and tubes were altogether replaced in televisions, leaving large stockpiles of unused Compactrons in warehouses. The last Compactrons were made in the early 1990\u2019s and are still readily available today as \u201cnew old stock\u201d (NOS) items. The Percolator, with its single Compactron tube, gives us a chance to re-purpose a piece of tube history, while offering unique tonality in this modern market.The information provided in this Instructable is also available in .pdf form from the Zeppelin Design Labs website.", "title": "The Percolator - 2W Guitar & Harmonica Tube Amp", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/The-Percolator-2W-Guitar-Harmonica-Tube-Amp/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Before you get started let's talk about safety. This is not a beginner\u2019s electronics project! If you have not worked with line/high voltage electricity before do not attempt this project without qualified help.

If you have never soldered a circuit board before, you MUST practice on something simpler and safer! If you lack experience, build this kit with a qualified friend. Use common sense when soldering. Use safety glasses and don\u2019t burn yourself or anything else. We also expect you to know how to use a digital multimeter (DMM). If you are not comfortable with using a DMM, either have an experienced friend help you, or learn how by reading this Instructable on using a multimeter.The Percolator was designed for 115-120VAC line voltage at 60hz. If you live in a place that doesn't have this type of line voltage then you must use an appropriate conversion transformer with this amp. Amplifiers handle HIGH VOLTAGES, higher than what comes out of the wall outlet. If you do not know what you are doing or you screw up this project, you could expose yourself or others to DEADLY HIGH VOLTAGE! Amplifiers have devices in them called capacitors. Capacitors (or caps) store high-voltage electricity for a long time, hours after the unit is turned off.

The other side of the board is called the \u201csolder side\u201d, which, as the name implies, is the side on which the legs of the components are soldered to the board. Proper technique for installing and soldering components to a circuit board is demonstrated in our assembly reference video, but there are several other great resources on YouTube or here on Instructables (check this one out). The general procedure consists of the following: Install the part on the \u201ccomponent side\u201d of the board, by threading the wire leads through the appropriate holes in the board. For your convenience, the board has silk screen outlines indicating where the components should be placed, along with text indicating the part number and often times the component value.Hold the component in place with your finger and turn the board over.Gently bend the leads out at about 45 degrees to keep the component from falling out of its holes.Install all of one type of component, bending each of the leads as they are installed.Flip the board over solder-side-up, and solder all of the components in one pass.Clip the leads off (with small diagonal cutters) right at the solder joint.Let\u2019s begin!Standoffs (Part # SP11): Use 6 standoffs, 6 M3 screws (Part # SC38), and 6 lock washers (Part # WA07). The plastic standoffs are installed on the solder side of the board, which means they are screwed in from the component side. The lock washer goes between the PCB and the standoff (not between the screw head and the PCB)(1). Place the 6 standoffs in the locations indicated below(2).Resistors: The value of resistors are given by a series of colored stripes on their body. There are several tutorials on line describing how to decode these stripes, but we will identify each resistor for you by simply naming the stripe colors, and giving you the value and the part number. Figure 2: Component Values and Locations is a handy reference. If you are color blind or can\u2019t see the stripes clearly, then you must use your digital multimeter to measure the resistance of each resistor.The hole spacing of most of the resistors on the circuit board allows the leads to be (gently) bent 90 degrees at the body of the resistor(3). This allows most resistors to slip into their holes very easily. Resistors R13 & R17 are exceptions to the normal hole spacing, so for those two components you\u2019ll have to estimate where to bend the leads.(3)Start with the 22K resistors (R1, R6, R11), labeled RED, RED, ORANGE, GOLD. Compare to its picture in the BOM. Find their locations on the circuit board and install and bend the leads as described above(4,5). Don\u2019t solder any of them until all 17 resistors are installed; just bend the leads to keep them in their place.Continue with the 220K resistors (R5, R9, R10), labeled RED, RED, YELLOW, GOLD.Continue with the 1.5K (or 1K5) resistors (R7, R14, R17), labeled BROWN, GREEN, RED, GOLD. R17 has a larger lead spacing than most of the other resistors so estimate where to bend the leads.Continue with the 47K resistors (R3, R8), labeled YELLOW, VIOLET, ORANGE, GOLD.Continue with the 120 ohm (or 120R) resistors (R12, R15), which are blue in color and are labeled BROWN, RED, BLACK, BLACK, BROWN.Continue with the 2.2K (or 2K2) resistor (R13), which is also blue in color and is labeled RED, RED, BLACK, BROWN, BROWN. The lead spacing on R13 is also abnormal, so bend the leads the proper length to fit into their holes.(6)Continue with the 1M resistor (R2), labeled BROWN, BLACK, GREEN, GOLD.Continue with the 820 ohm (or 820R) resistor (R4), labeled GRAY, RED, BROWN, GOLD. Last, install the 4.7K (or 4K7) resistor (R16), labeled YELLOW, VIOLET, RED, GOLD.You should have a whole forest of bent leads coming out the solder side of the board.(7) Now you can turn the board solder-side-up and solder each one to the board.(8)Now clip each lead with your flush cutters at the solder joint.(9)Before installing any more components on the circuit board, double check the resistance values of each of the installed resistors. Set your digital multimeter to the \u201cohms\u201d or \u201cresistance\u201d setting, and measure across all of the resistors. Compare the measured value to the listed value in Figure 2.(10) Make sure they are all correct (within 5%) before moving on.Capacitors: The Percolator uses 3 different types of capacitors: Film capacitors, tiny ceramic disc capacitors, and electrolytic capacitors. Film and ceramic caps can be installed in either direction on the circuit board (the legs can be reversed in their holes). But electrolytic caps are polarized, meaning they will only work when they are installed in the correct orientation.             Let\u2019s start with the two tiny ceramic caps (C4 ,C7).(11) Install, solder and clip the leads.Continue with the three film caps (C1 ,C3 ,C6)(12). Install (13), solder and clip the leads.Now for the tricky electrolytic caps. Note all the electrolytic capacitors have one leg that is longer than the other.(14, 15) The longer leg is the positive side of the cap. The positive leg (the longer leg) goes in the square pad. PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THIS WHEN YOU ARE INSTALLING THESE CAPS! It is very easy to install one or more electrolytic caps backwards! If you do, the amp won\u2019t work correctly! Double check Figure 2 for reference. Figure 2 also has \u201c+\u201d signs where the positive (longer) lead goes. The negative side of the caps have white stripes pointing to the negative lead.Install all of the smaller electrolytic caps (C2 ,C5 ,C8 ,C12). Solder and clip the leads.(16)Now install the three big electrolytic caps (C9 ,C10 ,C11).17 Solder and clip the leads(18), but put one of these clipped leads aside for use later.WARNING: The big electrolytic caps (C9 ,C10 ,C11) are likely to explode if they are installed backwards, which could result in personal injury. Install in STRICT CONFORMANCE with these instructions! Before moving on, double check the orientation of each of the electrolytic caps. Make sure the stripe on each electrolytic cap is in the same direction as each cap in the picture.(19)Jumper wire: Use one of the leads that you just clipped off of the big electrolytic capacitors (C9, C10, or C11) as this jumper. Use your needle nose pliers to bend the lead in the shape of a staple.(20) Install the jumper in the holes and solder the leads.(21)Bridge rectifiers (Part # BR1, BR2): Bridge rectifiers have 4 leads and it is very important to make sure each lead goes in the correct hole. The only indication on the circuit board of how the rectifiers should be oriented is a square pad. The positive lead (the longest lead(22), labeled with a \u201c+\u201d) goes in the square hole(23). The other leads should line up properly with the other holes.           Install both BR1 and BR2 with this orientation. Solder and clip the leads.Before moving on, double check the orientation of the bridge rectifiers. Make sure the \u201c+\u201d and \u201c-\u201d printed on the component are in the same orientation as the \u201c+\u201d and \u201c-\u201d on the circuit board.(24)Input jack (Part # J1): Remove the plastic nut from the input jack and put it aside until the next section. Snap the input jack into its holes on the circuit board.(25) Make sure you solder the leads well.(26) The leads are too short to cut on this component so don\u2019t bother.Potentiometer (Part # VR1): Remove the nut and washer from the shaft of the pot and put them aside until later. Install the potentiometer (\u201cpot\u201d for short) with the shaft facing away from the board. The leads are too short to bend out, so you just have to hold the pot while you solder at least one lead.(27) It is very important to make sure all the leads are completely seated in their holes before soldering, otherwise the board won\u2019t fit into the chassis properly. The leads are too short to cut on this component too.Power switch (Part # S1): Carefully install the power switch on the PCB.(28) If all the leads don\u2019t line up right away, very gently guide them into the holes with your needle-nose pliers.(29) When you solder the switch, it is very important to make sure all the leads are making good connections with the board because this component is switching high voltage. The front two pins just act as anchors for the switch and are connected to the large piece of metal on the front of the component. Extra heat may be needed to secure these pins properly because the large piece of metal tends to act as a heat sink. Once you have soldered all the leads, check the rigidity of the solder joints by flipping the switch several times. Make sure it feels secure.LED (Part # D1): The LED (light emitting diode) is a polarized component, meaning that it matters which way it goes into the holes. Following the standard of all the polarized components on this board, the long lead goes into the square hole.(30, 31) If you do not install the LED in the correct orientation the \u201con light\u201d will not work. Install the LED in the holes so that the top of the LED stands about 7/8\u201d (23mm) off the surface of the board.(32) Solder the LED on the component side of the board (it will be easier to switch later if you get it backwards).(33) Clip the leads on the solder side of the board.Feedback loop wire (Part # CB10.1): Strip about 1/4\u201d (6mm) of insulation from each end of the 10.5cm single stranded hookup wire.(34) Solder one end of this wire to the FBL hole so the wire is emerging from the component side of the board.(35, 36) The other end of the wire will be used in the next section.6cm Hookup wire (Part # CB10.4): Strip about 1/8\u201d (3-4mm) of insulation from each end of the 6cm hookup wire. With your pliers bend both ends at a right angle.(37) This wire goes on the solder side of the board, so flip the board over and install the wire where it goes (note the picture)(38). Solder it on the component side of the board.(39) Now bend the wire along the surface of the board to make it follow the line printed on the board.10.5cm Twisted pair hookup wire (Part # CB10.2): This wire is used to transmit the 6.3V heating filament voltage to the tube. Untwist about 1/4\u201d (6-7mm) of each end of the twisted pair and straighten the ends out with your pliers.(40) Strip off about 1/8\u201d (3-4mm) insulation from each end of the two wires.(41) On the solder side of the board, install the four stripped ends in the holes marked \u201cHEATERS\u201d.(42) It doesn't matter which wire goes into which of the two holes. Solder each of the four ends on the component side of the board.(43, 44)Tube socket (Part # SK10):Before installing the tube socket, we need to help prepare it to easily seat the tube. These sockets come a little tight from the factory, so it is helpful to loosen up the place where the tube pins fit in.(45) Very gently use your awl to slightly widen each of the 12 pin sockets.(46)The tube socket is installed on the solder side of the board. The leads may need to be pressed in slightly for it to fit in the holes.(47) Make sure all the leads are seated firmly and that the socket is pushed in as close to the board as possible.(48) Double check to make sure that the top of the socket is parallel to the surface of the board.Solder the leads of tube socket on the component side of the board.(49, 50)The circuit board is now complete! Double check all your solder joints and make sure everything is well soldered and making good connections. If anything looks at all sketchy, touch-up each solder joint. It\u2019s much easier to fix a problem with the board now than once it is installed in the chassis. Once you are satisfied with the PCB, put it aside in a safe spot until the next step when it is installed it in the chassis.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FKT/TME0/I6HSJXFU/FKTTME0I6HSJXFU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOQ/0OVR/I6RSHK28/FOQ0OVRI6RSHK28.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F38/P58H/I6RSHK2O/F38P58HI6RSHK2O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSH/Q1AP/I6RSHK3N/FSHQ1API6RSHK3N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI9/S5S1/I6RSHK3Y/FI9S5S1I6RSHK3Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F41/JUIL/I6RSHK43/F41JUILI6RSHK43.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDI/9LK5/I6RSHK4D/FDI9LK5I6RSHK4D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0X/EPZI/I6RSHK4F/F0XEPZII6RSHK4F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIQ/O4UC/I6RSHK4U/FIQO4UCI6RSHK4U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHH/BAYV/I6RSHK66/FHHBAYVI6RSHK66.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR5/RT7Z/I6RSHK79/FR5RT7ZI6RSHK79.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLW/YJST/I6RSHK7N/FLWYJSTI6RSHK7N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQT/BJDB/I6RSHK9W/FQTBJDBI6RSHK9W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP8/QU3S/I6RSHKB1/FP8QU3SI6RSHKB1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLS/MNL2/I6RSHKDJ/FLSMNL2I6RSHKDJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKY/BZHG/I6RSHKEG/FKYBZHGI6RSHKEG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUA/RHE8/I6RSHKHD/FUARHE8I6RSHKHD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM5/6N8I/I6RSHKIV/FM56N8II6RSHKIV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1X/I4AT/I6RSHKJ0/F1XI4ATI6RSHKJ0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSR/MWHG/I6RSHKKA/FSRMWHGI6RSHKKA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1Y/7G33/I6RSHKMZ/F1Y7G33I6RSHKMZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9B/4171/I6RSHKO3/F9B4171I6RSHKO3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHB/UG7O/I6RSHKQT/FHBUG7OI6RSHKQT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLS/QN37/I6RSHKS8/FLSQN37I6RSHKS8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F96/DVAJ/I6RSHKVS/F96DVAJI6RSHKVS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLL/GUHQ/I6RSHKW0/FLLGUHQI6RSHKW0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI6/R3JB/I6RSHKZL/FI6R3JBI6RSHKZL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI8/YDYC/I6RSHKZY/FI8YDYCI6RSHKZY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVK/SUH5/I6RSHL4J/FVKSUH5I6RSHL4J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUY/NEWE/I6RSHL4M/FUYNEWEI6RSHL4M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG0/B2XX/I6RSHL7V/FG0B2XXI6RSHL7V.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRR/X647/I6RSHL7Y/FRRX647I6RSHL7Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTY/49MD/I6RSHLBA/FTY49MDI6RSHLBA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO2/A8DI/I6RSHLBB/FO2A8DII6RSHLBB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUP/37FF/I6RSHLEM/FUP37FFI6RSHLEM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRE/LGH8/I6RSHLEQ/FRELGH8I6RSHLEQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAS/YTE9/I6RSHLH3/FASYTE9I6RSHLH3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU2/575J/I6RSHLI1/FU2575JI6RSHLI1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7X/FC1Y/I6RSHLIF/F7XFC1YI6RSHLIF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4Z/70O8/I6RSHLJG/F4Z70O8I6RSHLJG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE6/WBCU/I6RSHLKD/FE6WBCUI6RSHLKD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM5/GKV2/I6RSHLLD/FM5GKV2I6RSHLLD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5A/F9XG/I6RSHLO3/F5AF9XGI6RSHLO3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6Q/S5I3/I6RSHLOK/F6QS5I3I6RSHLOK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTI/2SGP/I6RSHLR1/FTI2SGPI6RSHLR1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQF/DBV7/I6RSHLRY/FQFDBV7I6RSHLRY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9R/FU3K/I6RSHLS8/F9RFU3KI6RSHLS8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5N/0DFE/I6RSHLVO/F5N0DFEI6RSHLVO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJY/BS6R/I6RSHLVR/FJYBS6RI6RSHLVR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRB/LQ4Y/I6RSHLZ0/FRBLQ4YI6RSHLZ0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX7/O18O/I6RSHLZ5/FX7O18OI6RSHLZ5.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Populating the Circuit Board"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Note the chassis face with the big square hole is the BACK of the amp! Generally, hold the chassis with the back AWAY from you unless told otherwise! This will help avoid building the thing backwards.Grommets: Pop the 4 rubber grommets (Part # GR02) into the holes on top of the chassis as shown.(51)Power Transformer (Part # T1):         Cut the black wires coming from the power transformer to 4-5/16\u201d (11cm).(52) Put the black wires that you just cut aside because you will use them later. Cut the brown and red wires to 2-3/4\u201d (7cm).(53) Strip off about 3/16\u201d (4-5mm) of insulation from each of the 6 wires.(54) Twist together the tiny strands of wire on each of the stripped ends. Then \u201ctin\u201d the stripped part of each wire.(55, 56) \u201cTinning\u201d is the process of coating or filling a wire or connector contact with solder to make it easier to attach. It also helps to keep the tiny strands of wire from fraying out while you try to solder them. When you tin the transformer wires, make sure you do not use too much solder; otherwise the wire will be too thick to fit into the PCB holes later.The power transformer goes on the RIGHT side of the chassis (with the back of the chassis AWAY from you). Pass the red and brown wires through the rear-right grommet, and the black wires through the front-right grommet.(57) Align the transformer mounting holes with the holes in the chassis. Use two M3x6 machine screws (Part # SC38) and two M3 keps lock nuts (Part # NU10) to mount the transformer.(58) Screw down tight.(59)Now you need to twist the wires. Twist the black wires together somewhat tightly, but do not over twist the wires near where they emerge from the transformer. You do not want to stress the wires near the transformer coil, because they can easily break on the inside of the transformer, and that would be very bad. Also twist the red wires together and the brown wires together in the same way (not too tight near the coil).(60)Output Transformer (Part # T2):         Cut all of the wires coming from the output transformer to 4\u201d (10cm).(61, 62) Strip off about 3/16\u201d (4-5mm) of insulation from each of the four wires. Twist together the tiny strands of wire on each of the stripped ends and tin the stripped part of each wire.(63) Don\u2019t make the tinned wire too fat. The output transformer goes on the LEFT side of the chassis. Pass the green and black wires through the left-rear grommet, and the blue and red wires through the front-left grommet.(64) Screw the transformer down to the chassis, just like the power transformer, with two M3x6 machine screws (Part # SC38) and two M3 keps lock nuts (Part # NU10).(65)Twist the green and black wires together, and twist the red and blue wires together, in the same way as the power transformer wires.(66) Once again, be mindful not to over twist the wires close to the coil.Fins (Part # CH05) (2 pcs): These flank the tube socket and shield the tube from the magnetic fields from the transformers. Place them as shown, careful that they face the right way. If you put them in backwards, the tube won\u2019t fit later. If the fins look like the letter L, then the base of the L points towards the tube opening. Use four #10x3/8\u201d sheet metal screws (Part # SC68) to attach the fins.(67) DO NOT OVER-TIGHTEN THESE SCREWS! Just drive them in snug. If you over-tighten, they will strip out the chassis. TIP: If the label is slightly misaligned over one of the edges or holes use a razor blade or xacto knife to trim off the excess.Label (Part # PL11): Clean the front of the chassis with a clean rag moistened with isopropyl alcohol, denatured alcohol, or rubbing alcohol.(68) Clean it thoroughly, and allow any liquid to dry completely. Be careful NOT TO TOUCH the face AT ALL after cleaning. The oil on your fingertips will leave prints that will interfere with the bond of the label. Test fit the label, then peel off the back and carefully set it in place.(69) GET IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME! YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RE-POSITION THIS LABEL! Line up the bottom edge of the label with the bottom edge of the chassis; then align some of the chassis holes, drop it in place, and rub it down firmly over the entire surface.LED bezel (Part # SK05): Install the plastic LED bezel into its hole on the front of the chassis (through the label).70 It goes in the hole to the right of the ZDL logo. It should easily snap into place. (70)Install the PCB (Part # PC23):Flip the chassis over so the fins and transformers are resting on the table top, and the front of the chassis is facing you. Bend all the transformer wires to the outside of the chassis so that they don\u2019t get in the way of the placement of the PCB.(71)Carefully place the circuit board in the chassis with the standoffs down (the standoffs resting on the top of the chassis) and the component side of the board up. The input jack side of the board should be closest to you. Slide the PCB forward as the input jack, pot, and switch fit through the holes on the front of the chassis and the tube socket is seated in its chassis hole.(72) You may have to hold the board at an angle while sliding it forward to get everything to fit properly. Make sure all the transformer wires are between the front and back standoffs. The standoffs should line up with the screw holes on top of the chassis.Affix the PCB to the chassis with six machine screws (Part # SC38) placed through the chassis holes into the standoffs.(73) Don\u2019t over tighten or cross-thread these screws.Place the washer and nut back on the pot, and snug down with your pliers.(74) Place the plastic nut back on the input jack,(75) and snug it down with your pliers. Do not over-tighten this nut or the label could start warping.Use your needle nose pliers to bend the LED over to fit inside of the LED bezel on the front of the chassis.(76) Be sure not to twist the LED or the leads might touch and short out against each other. Push the LED through the bezel until it snaps into place.Knob (Part # KN05): Turn the pot all the way counter clockwise. Place the knob on the pot and align the white line on the knob to the position where you want the volume to be off (usually between 1:00 & 2:00, when the amp is upside down). Use a small flat screwdriver to tighten the set screw until the knob is tight.(77) Now turn the knob all the way right and left through its travel. The line should be between 10:00 & 11:00 at the maximum clockwise position. The goal in setting the knob is to make the 6:00 position of the knob (when the amp is upside down) be the half way point of the pot turn, in other words, the turning distance either side of middle should be equal. If it\u2019s not right, loosen the screw, adjust the knob, and re-tighten. It may take a few times of re-adjustment to get the knob/pot position where you want it.Wiring the PCB: Once the PCB is affixed to the chassis you can attach the transformer wires. All of the wires will pass around the side of the PCB, and you will solder them on the component side of the board.         Output transformer: Place the red wire into the square hole of P1, and then the blue wire to the round hole of P1. Solder both connections.(78)Power transformer: Place the black wires into the holes of P4; it doesn\u2019t matter which wire goes in which hole.(79) Place the red wires into the holes of P2 (80), and then place the brown wires into the holes of P3.(81) In each pair, it does not matter which wire goes in which hole, but MAKE SURE YOU MATCH THE COLOR TO THE CORRECT NUMBER! Solder all the wires in their respective holes.Grounding Wire (Part # CB10.3): Strip about 1/4\u201d (6mm) of insulation off both ends of one of the 4cm hookup wires. Using your needle nose pliers, bend a small hook in one stripped end of the wire.(82) Thread the hook through the small hole on the grounding lug (Part # CB20) and crimp it tight with your pliers.(83) Solder that connection.(84) Put this assembly aside until the next sub-step.IEC Power Receptacle (Part # J3):         Strip about 1/4\u201d (6mm) of insulation off the ends of the other 4cm hookup wire (Part # CB10.3).(85) Attach the wire to the power receptacle lug as shown, with the wire pointing to the left away from the power receptacle (study the picture carefully). Use the same hook and crimp technique that you used in the previous sub-step, but don\u2019t solder it yet. MAKE SURE YOU ATTACH THE WIRE TO THE CORRECT POWER RECEPTACLE LUG.Now attach the other 4cm wire (the end opposite the ground lug) to the same power receptacle lug . Attach it so the ground lug is pointing to the right, away from the power receptacle (study the picture carefully).(86)Now solder the wires to the lug. Be careful not to use too much heat or the lug could start melting out of the plastic.(87)Bend both wires slightly forward and push the power receptacle through the chassis. BE SURE TO INSTALL IT WITH THE CORRECT SIDE UP (look at the picture).(88) It may be a tight fit; it could take some wrenching to get it to seat. Once it is seated properly, you can very gently bend the four retaining tabs of the power receptacle up if you want to ensure a tighter fit.(89)Place the wire coming from the right side of the power receptacle (the wire without the ground lug on it) in one of the 3 square ground pads on the PCB next to the power receptacle. Solder this wire in place on the component side of the board.(90)Use your flat screwdriver to pry the fuse holder from the power receptacle.91 Pace the fuse (Part # F1) in the holder(92) and slide it back into the power receptacle.(93)Grounding Wire Revisited: Use a M3x6 machine screw (Part # SC38) and one M3 Lock Nut, (Part # NU10) to attach the grounding lug to the back of the chassis as shown.(94) Screw it down tight!Wiring the IEC power receptacle:WARNING: If you make a mistake here, you could expose yourself or others to electric shock. Double check all your connections. Retrieve the lengths of wire that you cut off the power transformer earlier. Cut each of the two black wires to 4-1/4\u201d (10.5cm) long.(95) Strip about 3/16\u201d (4-5mm) of insulation from each end of both wires.(96) Tin each end (don\u2019t use too much solder).Now twist the two wires together, to within about 3/8\u201d of each end.(97) Solder one end of the pair to the holes labled P5, IEC jack.(98)Solder the end of the wires to the IEC power receptacle, to the two lugs shown in the picture.(99) It doesn\u2019t matter which wire goes to which lug, JUST MAKE SURE YOU SOLDER THEM TO THE CORRECT TWO LUGS! Mind the picture.(100)Output jack (Part # J2):         Remove the nut and washer from the output jack and install it on the back of the chassis.(101) Orient the jack so the lugs are facing up, as in the picture. The washer goes on the outside of the jack, between the nut and the chassis.With your needle nose pliers make a small hook in the stripped section of the feedback loop wire (the long wire attached to the middle of the circuit board, in the FBL hole). Hook the FBL wire on the \u201ctip\u201d lug of the output jack (note the picture below(102), if you are not sure which is the correct lug).Next attach the green wire from the output transformer to the same lug (the \u201ctip\u201d lug) as the FBL wire.(102) Solder both wires to the lug.Next, attach the black wire from the output transformer to the ground lug (note the picture if you are not sure which lug is the ground).(103) Solder the black wire to the lug.Tube (Part # V1): TIP: You can tell if the vacuum is bad in your tube because the \u201cgetter flash\u201d (the shiny metallic section on the inside of the glass) will turn white or clear.(105)Take the tube out of its box and closely look at the pins. Sometimes a few of the pins get bent in the handling or shipping process from the factory. If any of the pins are bent, very gently use your needle nose pliers to straighten them out.(104) Do this step very carefully and do not put too much torque on the pin at the point where it comes out of the glass. If you do, the glass could easily crack and allow the vacuum in the tube to be compromised, which would mean we\u2019d have to sell you a new tube.Now flip the amp right-side-up again and install the tube in its socket. It can only go in one way. Line up the pins and then gently rock the tube,(106) pressing gently but firmly down on the top, until it is completely seated in the socket.(107) If it has a hard time fitting into the socket make sure all the tube pins line up with the socket pins properly. If you still have trouble, you might need to use your awl again to loosen the tube socket pins.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F31/6LDM/I6RSHQS5/F316LDMI6RSHQS5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTD/ZAV2/I6RSHQTB/FTDZAV2I6RSHQTB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAR/58OQ/I6RSHQTO/FAR58OQI6RSHQTO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ6/UGOL/I6RSHQWK/FJ6UGOLI6RSHQWK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F69/FL04/I6RSHQWY/F69FL04I6RSHQWY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXZ/7XPI/I6RSHQXO/FXZ7XPII6RSHQXO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2K/4B0I/I6RSHQYB/F2K4B0II6RSHQYB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5K/2YA5/I6RSHQYT/F5K2YA5I6RSHQYT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F09/4VFZ/I6RSHR26/F094VFZI6RSHR26.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4K/RZ4A/I6RSHR88/F4KRZ4AI6RSHR88.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLX/O18W/I6RSHR8N/FLXO18WI6RSHR8N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1X/2DS7/I6RSHR96/F1X2DS7I6RSHR96.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAQ/39KK/I6RSHRDJ/FAQ39KKI6RSHRDJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FES/Y1WL/I6RSHRFY/FESY1WLI6RSHRFY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS9/KX10/I6RSHRK1/FS9KX10I6RSHRK1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F85/R51T/I6RSHRKX/F85R51TI6RSHRKX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIM/JXIM/I6RSHRNT/FIMJXIMI6RSHRNT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVA/YU6J/I6RSHROK/FVAYU6JI6RSHROK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3W/6WN3/I6RSHRUK/F3W6WN3I6RSHRUK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRZ/E07K/I6RSHRUX/FRZE07KI6RSHRUX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTU/W8W1/I6RSHS10/FTUW8W1I6RSHS10.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ0/7J4X/I6RSHS1Y/FJ07J4XI6RSHS1Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZV/R7IX/I6RSHS4X/FZVR7IXI6RSHS4X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2V/ZTVV/I6RSHS5I/F2VZTVVI6RSHS5I.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPH/TYLK/I6RSHS87/FPHTYLKI6RSHS87.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSL/QVW2/I6RSHSC9/FSLQVW2I6RSHSC9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZB/BW3M/I6RSHSCM/FZBBW3MI6RSHSCM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP4/L3WR/I6RSHSGO/FP4L3WRI6RSHSGO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKG/12MW/I6RSHSKR/FKG12MWI6RSHSKR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOV/NX92/I6RSHSLI/FOVNX92I6RSHSLI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLW/18NV/I6RSHSMC/FLW18NVI6RSHSMC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO2/V8MK/I6RSHSNL/FO2V8MKI6RSHSNL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP1/M2CN/I6RSHSNP/FP1M2CNI6RSHSNP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4I/DDH0/I6RSHSNV/F4IDDH0I6RSHSNV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQC/OX5R/I6RSHSNX/FQCOX5RI6RSHSNX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOD/GL12/I6RSHSOA/FODGL12I6RSHSOA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOQ/QRXN/I6RSHSQW/FOQQRXNI6RSHSQW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZM/644V/I6RSHSRD/FZM644VI6RSHSRD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9U/69YB/I6RSHSTN/F9U69YBI6RSHSTN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2T/NBJB/I6RSHSTT/F2TNBJBI6RSHSTT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSG/RAWT/I6RSHSW9/FSGRAWTI6RSHSW9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F11/KAHA/I6RSHSX3/F11KAHAI6RSHSX3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAD/GQ64/I6RSHSZR/FADGQ64I6RSHSZR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN2/1BQG/I6RSHT0N/FN21BQGI6RSHT0N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDU/M3O5/I6RSHT11/FDUM3O5I6RSHT11.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWB/RNG7/I6RSHT1Q/FWBRNG7I6RSHT1Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3K/XTDA/I6RSHT4A/F3KXTDAI6RSHT4A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWD/F6Z7/I6RSHT4K/FWDF6Z7I6RSHT4K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLZ/DBYB/I6RSHT6W/FLZDBYBI6RSHT6W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6T/HXBU/I6RSHT73/F6THXBUI6RSHT73.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7V/NF59/I6RSHTA4/F7VNF59I6RSHTA4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7B/GFPV/I6RSHTA9/F7BGFPVI6RSHTA9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGS/D6YN/I6RSHTD5/FGSD6YNI6RSHTD5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOE/NALK/I6RSHTDB/FOENALKI6RSHTDB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWA/JS5S/I6RSHTE2/FWAJS5SI6RSHTE2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHK/BUGP/I6RSHTGB/FHKBUGPI6RSHTGB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0U/1R5O/I6RSHTGZ/F0U1R5OI6RSHTGZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Loading the Chassis"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "The testing process is done with the Percolator upside down. The transformers and fins should be resting on the bench top. Make sure none of the weight of the amp is resting on the glass bottle of the tube. If it is, put some blocks of wood (like the cabinet pieces that came with the kit) under the transformers to jack the amp up a little bit. A schematic of the amplifier is printed on the template sheet that came with the kit. This schematic is for reference in troubleshooting, should you have problems with the amp. DC test voltages are labeled in red on \u201cFigure 3: Voltage Reference\u201d. The test procedure will consist of systematically measuring these voltages to ensure that your amp is within spec. Print this diagram and write your measurements directly on it. You don\u2019t have to know how to read a schematic to test these voltages, but you do need to know how to use your digital multimeter. WITH THE AMP UNPLUGGED, double check all your wiring. Look closely at the pictures and make sure the wires on your amp are correctly positioned.(108,109)WITH THE AMP UNPLUGGED from the wall, double check your solder joints. Closely examine every visible joint on the PCB and make sure they are good, solid connections.Using a 1/4\u201d speaker cable, plug the Percolator\u2019s output jack into an 8 ohm speaker cabinet. ONLY USE AN 8 OHM CABINET WITH THIS AMPLIFIER. WHENEVER YOU APPLY POWER TO THIS AMP, MAKE SURE IT IS FIRST PLUGGED IN TO AN 8 OHM LOAD.Make sure the Percolator\u2019s power switch is in the off position (when the amp is upside down, the switch should be up).(110) Plug the IEC power cable into the IEC power receptacle on the amp. Make sure NOTHING is touching any part of the amplifier that shouldn't be, and then plug the power cable into the wall outlet.WARNING! As soon as you plug in the Percolator, there is LINE VOLTAGE across some parts of the exposed circuit board. Touching the board could shock, injure, or kill you! NEVER TOUCH ANY PART OF THE CIRCUIT BOARD WHEN THE AMP IS PLUGGED INTO THE WALL!Before you turn the power switch on, set your multimeter to test AC voltage. Measure the AC voltage across the IEC power receptacle as shown.(111) Depending on several (mostly uncontrollable) factors, you should measure between 115VAC and 120VAC. The amplifier was designed to use 118VAC from the wall outlet, so the voltages listed in the test procedure are based on that. If your AC voltage reading is different than 118VAC, then the voltage readings in the next few steps will be off proportionally. Theoretically, if the input voltage from the wall outlet is off by a certain percentage then all of the rest of the voltages in the amp will be off by the same percentage. The tolerances of the tube and the rest of the components can easily vary by 5%, so that could cause a bit of voltage fluctuation as well.Set your digital multimeter to read DC voltage. In this amp, all DC voltages are measured with respect to ground, so the black probe of your multimeter should be held at ground potential. This amp has several places at ground potential that are good to put your black probe. Any of the vias (the tiny holes throughout the PCB) should work.(112) Any one of the 3 square pads on the PCB under the IEC power receptacle will work.(113) You could also use any place on the chassis, assuming the ground lug is making good contact with the chassis.(114) Keep the black probe on any of those places while making DC voltage measurements.TIP: Use a test lead (a wire with small alligator clips on both ends) to clip the negative (black) lead of your multimeter to the grounded chassis. That will free up one hand.Turn on the power switch.WARNING! As soon as you turn on the Percolator, there is HIGH VOLTAGE across several parts of the exposed circuit board. Touching the board could shock, injure or kill you! NEVER TOUCH ANY PART OF THE CIRCUIT BOARD WHEN THE AMP IS PLUGGED INTO THE WALL! The red LED should immediately turn on (115) (if it does, skip to the next sub-step). If it doesn't turn on, then measure the junction of C12 and R17 (TP2 in \u201cFigure 3: Voltage Reference\u201d). It should read around 6.5VDC. If it does, it means you either installed the LED backwards, or you installed the wrong resistor in R17. Switch off the amp, unplug the power cable and fix the problem. If TP2 does not read around 6.5VDC (by a large percentage) double check C12 and/or BR2 to make sure they are in the proper orientation.WARNING: Capacitors contain high-voltage electricity hours after the amp is unplugged! Handling the capacitor could shock or burn you! If you must remove or re-solder a capacitor, either let it sit unplugged overnight, or safely discharge it as described in the tip below.Tip: To safely discharge a capacitor: Get a 1k-10k ohm, 2w resistor and solder or clip test leads to the resistor legs. Clip one of the leads to the chassis, and clip the other lead to the positive side of the high-voltage cap. The cap will discharge in a few seconds.Figure 3 has 11 DC test voltages (in red) with arrows pointing to the place on the circuit board where these voltages should be found. The points are numbered TP1 through TP11 (\u201cTP\u201d stands for \u201ctest point\u201d). Remember, you are measuring from ground (with the black probe) to the red point (with the red probe).(116) Start on the left side of the board and work your way from point to point, making note of each voltage as you measure it. All the voltages should be relatively close to the printed value, but if the line voltage (from the wall outlet) is above or below 118 VAC, then these voltages will be off by the same percentage. If any of these voltages are significantly off beyond this line voltage percentage, then it is very likely that one or more of the components are installed in the wrong place. Triple check the resistors, capacitors, and bridge rectifiers by visually inspecting each one. If they are all correct, then triple check each solder joint. If you make any changes, use your multimeter to re-test the voltages that were incorrect. If you have to get to the solder side of the board, you\u2019ll have to unsolder all the transformer wires from the board, and remove the IEC receptacle, as well as unscrew the front panel components and stand off screws from the chassis.TIP: If it turns out that you need to re-solder any of the resistors, don\u2019t bother removing the board from the chassis to get to the solder side, just solder them on the component side of the board.Once the voltages are all within spec, carefully plug your guitar (or harp mic) into the input jack, taking care not to touch the exposed circuit board. Make some noise.(117) Turn up the volume.

On the other hand, while the amp can be built in an hour, it takes several hours over several days to complete the cabinet! Take your time, be careful, and you should produce a lovely solid wood cabinet to be proud of. We are going to show you how we make the pre-finished Percolator here in our lab. There are as many carpentry and finishing techniques as there are carpenters and finishers. If you prefer to do something differently, go for it. If you have an experienced friend to work on this with you, take his or her advice over ours. A Word On CountersinksThe overall success of this project depends somewhat on your ability to accurately countersink the wood screws, so that the heads lie just below the surface of the wood, but no deeper. There are several ways to do this: buy a #6 pilot bit (9/64) with matching fluted countersink and stop collar, or an all-in-one #6 pilot / counterbore / countersink tool (A)    buy a countersink bit (B)    Use a \u00bc\u201d drill bit in a drill pressThe first (A) is our favorite: very accurate and easy to use. The second, a countersink bit (B), is next best. If you don\u2019t do a lot of wood working, you may not want to invest in these tools. This leaves using a \u00bc drill bit in a press. To do this, first drill through with the 9/64 bit, then countersink with the \u00bc bit, carefully and gradually adjusting the depth of plunge until the full diameter of the bit just barely cuts into the wood. The screw should then pull the head down into the wood and just below the surrounding surface. Practice setting the depth on a scrap of pine until you like the results.ALWAYS provide a 1/16\u201d pilot in the holding piece of wood, and keep the clutch on your screw gun set low when driving, or the screws provided are likely to spin out or break.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FPU/SPB7/I6RSI6VH/FPUSPB7I6RSI6VH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFZ/19CT/I6RSI1W7/FFZ19CTI6RSI1W7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAY/8MPV/I6RSI1WT/FAY8MPVI6RSI1WT.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Building the Cabinet - Intro"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "Fitting the Wood Parts (Part # CA05). Note that the longer wood parts are the top and bottom (Part # CA05.1) and the shorter pieces (Part # CA05.2) are the sides. Arrange the four pieces of wood as shown in the diagram. If you have a preference for the appearance of grain, color, knots, etc, flip the parts around this way and that until you like the way they look.(121) Sometime, the wood exhibits blemishes on one side from the milling process. Face these toward the inside. They will be completely invisible and will have no effect on the quality of the cabinet.With the pencil, label the parts where it won\u2019t show, so you can easily fit them together again later. Put the labels towards the front of each piece.(122)With scissors or blade, cut out the templates provided with your kit.(123) If you ruin them, you can just print them out again with the \"Percolator Cabinet Templates\" pdf. Tape the templates to the top, the bottom and the right-hand side (as you face the front).(124, 125) If the templates do not match the wood size PERFECTLY (it happens), line up the FRONT EDGE of the template to the FRONT EDGE of the wood, and center it along the length of the wood. Don\u2019t worry about the REAR edge.With the awl, or nail and a small hammer, carefully poke a hole into the wood at the center of each cross hairs.(126) Remove the template from the right side,(127, 128) flip it over and tape it face-down to the LEFT side and mark that piece as well.(129) Take care when you do this that you create a PAIR of parts, not two IDENTICAL parts.(130)NOTE: You don\u2019t have to use the handle provided with your kit. You can use any handle you like, but in that case, check the hole spacing before you poke your marks in the cabinet top!Stand up all four pieces of wood on their FRONT edges on your clean, smooth, flat work surface.(131) Dry-fit them together. Use the bar clamp to snug the pieces together as shown.(132) If your clamp has no plastic pads, DO NOT OVERTIGHTEN or you\u2019ll mar the wood. It just needs to be snug. Pick one corner and line up the pieces of wood as carefully and accurately as you can.(133) Be sure the faces (the sides touching the table) are flush to each other at the joint.(134) If the parts are not precisely the same width (it happens), they will be a tiny bit uneven on the back face (that is, the sides facing up). That\u2019s okay; don\u2019t worry about it \u2013 it\u2019s the back. You can fix it later when finishing the cabinet.When you are satisfied with the alignment of one corner, tighten the clamp to secure the parts for drilling.Take your time with this step. The overall neatness of your cabinet depends on getting this step right.Fit your drill with the 1/16\u201d bit, sticking out about 1-1/8\u201d. These break easily; you may want to pick up a spare. At the corner you lined up, drill two holes at your marks, through the side and into the mated wood piece.(135)Continue to the other three corners, loosening the clamp and lining up the corners one by one. Drill a total of 8 holes.(136)Disassemble the four pieces and lay them flat on your worktable with the outsides facing up. Still with the 1/6\u201d bit, drill four pilot holes about \u00bd\u201d deep in the bottom as indicated on the template, for the screws that will hold on the feet.(137) Note these are the four OUTER holes, nearest the corners. With the 9/64 bit, or the combo drill / countersink bit, re-drill the eight small holes you made in the sides, plus 7 other holes as indicated on the templates: one more on each side, one on the top, and four on the bottom. NOTE: These four holes on the bottom are the four INNER holes, further away from the corners. They are for mounting the chassis and need to be as accurate as possible. A drill press is great for this if you have one. Otherwise, be careful to hold the drill perpendicular to the wood surface. Drill and countersink a total of 15 holes.(138, 139)TIP: You will get cleaner holes on the inside of the parts if you can drill straight through the cabinet parts into a piece of plywood.When you countersink, practice on the four bottom holes, where the depth is less critical. Go easy, test-fit a screw, and deepen the countersink a little as necessary. The head should sit below the surface of the surrounding wood, but only just.(140)With the 3/16 bit, drill the two holes in the cabinet top for the handle screws.(141)NOTE: If you use a handle other than the one provided, check the screw size before drilling these two holes in the cabinet top!Inspect the inside faces of the wood pieces for splinters or \u201cblowout\u201d: bits of wood standing above the surrounding surface. Clean these off with a bit of 120-grit sandpaper.(142)Re-assemble and dry fit the parts,(143) with the front edges facing DOWN.(144) Apply some wood glue to one end of the TOP. Smooth the glue with a stick until it uniformly coats the end.(145) You don\u2019t need much!Fit two wood screws into the appropriate two holes of the mating SIDE piece.(146) Guide the tips into the little pilot holes in the top piece.(147) Line up the joint accurately as you did earlier,(148,132) and place the bar clamp tightly across the parts to hold them secure. Use a #2 Philips screwdriver or cordless screw gun to drive the screws barely snug.(149) Do not overtighten! If your drill has an adjustable clutch, set it very low, like 2 or 3. Leave the joint a little loose for now.Now attach the BOTTOM to the same SIDE, driving the screws barely snug.(150)Now apply glue to the remaining exposed ends of both the TOP and BOTTOM.(151) Fit four screws into the remaining SIDE and maneuver them into all four little pilot holes.(152) Align one joint (153) and tighten the bar clamp (not shown; very foolish of us to attempt this without the clamp). Carefully drive the two screws barely snug, then align the last joint, and set the last two screws, barely snug.(154) See also our online video for proper placement of the bar clamp.Check the box for overall squareness: press the face flat to the table; measure diagonally across the cabinet to see if it measures the same in both directions.(155, 156) If necessary, install the bar clamp across the longer diagonal and gently tighten it to bring the box closer to square.(157) Now tighten all eight screws.(158) If any glue appears on the outside of the box, wipe it off with a rag dipped in warm water.Let the cabinet sit for at least 4 hours for the glue to cure.(159)If any joints are poorly mated, grind them flush with 60 or 80 grit sandpaper.(160, 161)Edge Detail: If you want to apply a router detail, now\u2019s the time. There\u2019s only room for a small chamfer or roundover. (If you don\u2019t want to use a router, you can achieve a similar look just with vigorous hand-sanding.) We use a 3/16\u201d roundover bit with a bearing at the bottom.(162) As you route each edge, be careful to orient the router so that you do not run the bearing across the screw heads.(163) This will result in blemishes that could ruin your cabinet! Round over all the outside edges except the four back edges.DANGER! Routers are dangerous, tricky machines that can do you a serious harm if misused. If you are unfamiliar with routers, get a friend to help you!If there are chips, or gaps in your joints that you cannot live with, fill them with wood dough.

Following is how we finish our cabinets here at the Lab. You may finish your Percolator any way you like. Your cabinet is made of top-grade solid poplar. This is a dense, very finely grained softwood. It is harder, more stable and more durable than pine. It is the wood of choice for all fine millwork that is destined to be painted, but properly prepared it stains nicely too. Do not sand the interior of the cabinet at all. Sand the whole exterior twice, using 120 and 220 grit sandpapers. If you routed a detail, carefully sand out any burn marks, and be careful you do not obliterate your detail with the orbital sander.(165)\u201cEase\u201d the square edges; that is, strike off the sharp square edge the mill applied to the wood. Your finish ingredients cannot accumulate on a sharp edge. Don\u2019t use the orbital for this, at least not for the inside edges; sand the square edges by hand only.(166)Be thorough! The better job you do here will strongly influence how nicely your stain turns out.(167)Remove the dust: blast it with compressed air, draw it off with a vacuum, or wipe with a clean rag. Apply a liberal coat of MinWax Dark Walnut Wood Finish #2716 with a rag.(168) This is an oil-based stain, one of the easiest to use. Coat the entire cabinet inside and out,(169, 170) then wipe it off again with a clean rag.(171, 172) Rub it out thoroughly and carefully, leaving no fingerprints or streaks.(173) Set the cabinet down on its back, propped up on a few pencils, or chopsticks, or triangular strips of wood. Let it dry for at least 4 hours!(174)Use a clean rag to apply a coat of MinWax Wipe-On Poly Clear Satin.(175) This is a remarkable product that is thick enough to provide a decent finish, but thin enough to soak straight into the wood without running or dripping. Pour a little product into a disposable metal or plastic cup, like the bottom inch cut from a soda can. Dip your rag and apply a generous coat to the whole cabinet, inside and out.(176-178) Set it back down on its back to dry thoroughly, like, overnight.(179)Very lightly hand sand the exterior of the cabinet with 320 grit sandpaper.(180) Ignore the interior; it\u2019s done. The finish is thin, so be careful you do not remove the poly and damage the stained wood underneath. You are trying to strike off the fuzzy grain raised in the finishing process so far. This sanding should produce a fine white powder that feels soft as velvet to the touch.(181) Wipe it off with a clean cloth.(182)Clean up your work space as best you can. Remove all the dust from the cabinet and the work table. Sweep or vacuum the floor. It is dust in the air that affects the final finish. Apply a second coat of Wipe-On Poly to the exterior. Allow to dry thoroughly.(183, 184)At this point, if the box is beautiful and satiny-smooth, you are done. If it is still a little fuzzy or uneven, sand lightly with 320 grit sandpaper and apply a third light coat. Allow to dry thoroughly.

Spread it out to coat the entire end of the stick.(190)Fit the pieces together and place a bar clamp across the width of the frame.(191) Gently snug the clamp down on the frame just until you see glue squeezing out of all four corners.(192) Wipe off the excess glue with a damp rag. Allow at least 4 hours for the glue to cure.Remove the clamp. Paint the inside surfaces, and one face, with flat black paint (or a permanent black marker).(193, 194) Allow to dry completely.Now it is time to put on the grill cloth. Attaching grill cloth in a way that looks nice is not an easy task. There are 2 goals to keep in mind when working with grill cloth: 1) Keep the lines straight; nobody thinks crooked or wavy grill cloth looks good. 2) Make the grill cloth tight. Saggy grill cloth is almost as unattractive as wavy lines. There are several different techniques for accomplishing these two goals, but the process described here has worked well for us. If you aren't confident about doing this step, call your local upholstery shop and they might be able to help you out.The first part of putting on grill cloth consists of folding the 4 sides while carefully following straight lines.     Set the grill cloth face-down on the table. The face is the side with a distinct grid pattern and broken black lines.(195) Place the frame black-side-down neatly centered on the grill cloth.(196) Align one of the long sides with one of the silver lines about an inch from the edge of the grill cloth. Remove the frame and fold the cloth over on the silver line and crease it the entire length of the grill cloth.(197) The bent edge should be at a 90 degree angle.(198)Place the frame back on the grill cloth (with the long edge against the fold) and line up one of the short sides with one of the black lines on the grill cloth about one inch away from the edge of the cloth.(199) Remove the frame, and use scissors or a razor to cut the grill cloth along the folded crease to the chosen black line. DO NOT OVER CUT THIS LINE.(200) Fold over the grill cloth at the black line and crease it the entire width of the cloth.(201)Place the frame back on the cloth with the edges against the two folds. Now find the line on the grill cloth (one of the threads) that is parallel and closest to the the other long side of the frame. Remove the frame and cut the grill cloth along the short folded crease to this new parallel line. Once again, DO NOT OVER CUT THIS LINE.(202) Fold and crease the grill cloth on the new parallel line the entire length of the grill cloth.(203, 204)With the frame resting between the 3 folds, find the line that is parallel and closest to remaining short side of the frame. Remove the frame and cut the grill cloth on each of the long-side folds up to this new line. ONCE AGAIN, DON\u2019T OVER CUT.(205, 206) Fold and crease along this line. (207, 208)While holding the frame (black side down) onto the grill cloth, turn the assembly around and look at the front. The edges of the grill cloth should wrap tightly around the frame, and all the lines on the cloth should be parallel or perpendicular to the frame sides. Check the straightness of the lines (in both directions) with your speed square and make sure the back of the grill cloth is flat against the front of the frame.(209)Place the assembly face down on the table. While holding the grill cloth in its proper place, use your staple gun to put one staple in the middle of each side of the frame. Make sure the staple is right in the middle of the side in both directions (up/down and left/right).(210)Re-examine the assembly to make sure the grill cloth lines are still straight (use your speed square)(211) and check to make sure the back of the grill cloth is still tight against the face of the frame. If so, proceed with placing staples around the outside. Start in the middle of each side and move to the corners. Alternate sides with each staple. Make sure that all of the staples seat completely, or the frame may not fit into the amp cabinet. If some of the staples need to be pushed in further, you can use your channel locks to squeeze them in. Periodically check with your speed square that the lines are remaining straight (in both directions). Don\u2019t worry about getting the grill cloth too tight right now, just concern yourself with getting the lines straight. If you notice some of the lines are going crooked pull out the necessary staples and start over. Take your time and you will be pleased with the results.(212-214)When you are done stapling and the lines are all straight, cut the surplus lengths of the grill cloth from the corners of the frame.(215)Fold the remaining grill cloth over to the back of the frame and staple it down. Leave about 1/2\u201d from the corners without any staples.(216)At one corner of the frame, hold both corners of the grill cloth down, one on top of the other. Use your razor to cut a 45 degree line through both layers of cloth, from the corner of the frame.(217) Remove both cut corners of grill cloth.(218) Use one staple to hold down the grill cloth in the corner. Do this for the other 3 corners.(219)Use a match or lighter to carefully singe the loose threads at the corners as shown.(220) Move the flame quickly - grill cloth melts very fast. WARNING: Open flames are dangerous, especially around flammable material such as grill cloth and wood. Use common sense.If the grill cloth seems looser than you are comfortable with then you can use your heat gun to tighten it up. This is a tricky process to apply just enough heat to tighten it up, but not enough to cause the lines to warp and go crooked, or even worse, burn through the grill cloth. We suggest you practice on some of the scraps you just cut from the frame assembly. This will give you an idea of how easily the grill cloth is affected by your heat gun. Start with the heat gun on the lowest setting and if that isn't hot enough, you can move up from there. Also, start with the heat gun at least 12\u201d away from the grill cloth; move closer if necessary. Move in broad, uniform movements over the entire area, warming the whole frame evenly. Be patient and take your time, and you should be pleased with the results.(221, 222)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FHP/EHPF/I6RSGC05/FHPEHPFI6RSGC05.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F84/GN16/I6RSGC0U/F84GN16I6RSGC0U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLI/NFBZ/I6RSGC0Y/FLINFBZI6RSGC0Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA5/1VOI/I6RSGC1C/FA51VOII6RSGC1C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU3/2RY8/I6RSGC1Q/FU32RY8I6RSGC1Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQE/QL5X/I6RSGC2A/FQEQL5XI6RSGC2A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM4/X8U7/I6RSGC2Q/FM4X8U7I6RSGC2Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FST/V7C7/I6RSGC3D/FSTV7C7I6RSGC3D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL6/NA2J/I6RSGC3L/FL6NA2JI6RSGC3L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ0/QYWR/I6RSGC3Y/FZ0QYWRI6RSGC3Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWW/ELXF/I6RSGC4G/FWWELXFI6RSGC4G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY0/3GC7/I6RSGC4Z/FY03GC7I6RSGC4Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0Q/MPVI/I6RSGC5K/F0QMPVII6RSGC5K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFO/03J1/I6RSGC5S/FFO03J1I6RSGC5S.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR8/J715/I6RSGC6A/FR8J715I6RSGC6A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAF/RPTK/I6RSGC6U/FAFRPTKI6RSGC6U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7G/QWDG/I6RSGC7A/F7GQWDGI6RSGC7A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNZ/ULGZ/I6RSGC8H/FNZULGZI6RSGC8H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJL/13W4/I6RSGC8N/FJL13W4I6RSGC8N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7Z/8B5Z/I6RSGCD3/F7Z8B5ZI6RSGCD3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6N/E1K0/I6RSGCDD/F6NE1K0I6RSGCDD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTB/81BN/I6RSGCDS/FTB81BNI6RSGCDS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGK/4WYF/I6RSGCE2/FGK4WYFI6RSGCE2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA8/FK39/I6RSGCE6/FA8FK39I6RSGCE6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBK/W77F/I6RSGCEZ/FBKW77FI6RSGCEZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAR/34GR/I6RSGCHG/FAR34GRI6RSGCHG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY0/OIZJ/I6RSGCI2/FY0OIZJI6RSGCI2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4S/TXA5/I6RSGCIG/F4STXA5I6RSGCIG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPT/5UUT/I6RSGCIV/FPT5UUTI6RSGCIV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNK/374Q/I6RSGCJA/FNK374QI6RSGCJA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F60/TYHR/I6RSGCJV/F60TYHRI6RSGCJV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAH/4ZNF/I6RSGCKM/FAH4ZNFI6RSGCKM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FME/8JGN/I6RSGCL3/FME8JGNI6RSGCL3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9B/E6MK/I6RSGE1V/F9BE6MKI6RSGE1V.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 12: Assembling the Grill"}, {"step": 13, "steps_text": "Place the cabinet upright on the table and carefully slip the amp in.(223) It should be a pretty nice slide-fit side-to-side.

With only 2 watts at full volume, the Percolator offers some serious cranked up tone at bedroom levels. If you take good care of your amp it should last you decades. The Percolator was designed to accept a high impedance signal. The amplifier input impedance is around 1M, so most electric guitars and high impedance harp mics will work well with this amp. One of the main things to remember when using the Percolator is to never turn it on without an 8 ohm speaker load plugged into the output jack! The Percolator was designed specifically to be used with the Zeppelin Design Labs 1x8 speaker cabinet (also available in kit form), but you can use any speaker cabinet or combination of speakers you\u2019d like, as long as the sum of the output impedance is 8 ohms. You also need to make sure that you are using a good quality, 1/4\u201d speaker cable -- not instrument cable! If you don\u2019t know the difference, go talk to the guy at your local pro sound or guitar shop. If you get the Zeppelin Design Labs 1x8 Speaker Cabinet kit, you will learn how to MAKE a quality speaker cable! It is also very important to be mindful of the line voltage (from the wall outlet) that you are subjecting your amp to. The Percolator was designed to use 118VAC from the wall outlet. If your outlet has less voltage than that across its terminals, then the amp will not be as loud as it should be. On the other hand, electronics in general, and tube amplifiers specifically hate voltage surges. It is true that tube amps are fairly robust electrically, but they also have a step-up transformer that multiplies the voltage from the wall to something much higher, and voltage spikes are multiplied by that ratio too. During these voltage spike situations, It is common for tube amplifiers to experience arcing in the secondary of the power transformer and also in the tubes. The fuse will protect your amp a lot of the time, but sometimes the transients are much quicker than the reaction time of the fuse. Therefore, it\u2019s a good idea to use some sort of surge protector to protect your amp from these transients. Use common sense with your Percolator. Never touch the tube when it\u2019s on (it gets quite hot). Never get the amp wet. Never use with an ungrounded IEC cable. Do not use with the wrong value of fuse. Heed all warnings. Follow all instructions. Rock out.

We used the shelves themselves to build the box that would house the amps. We wanted the box to fit two amps, a rack mount power supply, and a crossover unit.MeasuringDepth: Measure the depth required to hold the amps and some extra room to manage your connections. The boards we used were 15.5\u201d deep and fit the amps perfectly, so we didn\u2019t have to cut them down depth-wise.Width: Measure the space required to hold the amps by the rail mounts. NOTE: Rack mountable gear is 19 inches wide total; take into consideration the width of the material you are going to be using and adjust the width accordingly. In our case we were using 1 inch particle board and the tabs of the gear are over 1 inch so there were no fitting issues. Also, the box will later be wrapped in leather so we allowed some room to account for the width of the material.Height: Measure the height desired. We measured enough space to allow generous air flow. The amps used were modified and have small fans mounted on the top, so they required a little more head room. We left plenty of space for the power supply and crossover unit and a little bit extra for any future additions or modifications. The total height used was 19 inches.Cutting, Sanding and Building\nOnce we had our measurements we just had to cut the boards to specifications. We prepared the table saw, set it to the appropriate measurements, and got to cutting.\nAfter cutting, we had to make sure to clean the areas that were cut and prep the boards for further construction. Using a palm sander and 80 grit sandpaper, we sanded the edges of the boards that were going to make contact. This ensured that the wood glue used would adhere and provide a stronger bond. After cleaning the sanded areas with denatured alcohol and applying a generous amount of wood glue, we pressed the boards together and nailed them in place with a pneumatic nail gun attached to a 3 gallon air compressor (using 1 \u00bd inch finishing nails fired at 80psi). This step was repeated until all sides were attached to complete a basic box frame.\u00a0\nAfter completing the basic frame we added some \u2018L\u2019 brackets (a total of 4) at each corner to keep the box squared and true. Then we just stored the box away to let the glue set overnight.\nCheck out the video that summarizes our actual building process.Basic box build from Santos Nunez on Vimeo.Prepping for Further Accessories\nNow that the basic box has been built we wanted to make sure that our measurements were precise. This consisted of sitting the amps and other audio components in the box and spacing them out accordingly. We marked where we were going to install the power supply and the crossover and then evenly spaced out the amps to give them as much room for air flow as possible.\u00a0\nBefore moving away from the box we drilled out holes where the top amp and power supply were going to be and carefully measured an intersecting point for the cross dowel nuts and made the corresponding holes. The great thing about using these cross dowel nuts is that we didn\u2019t lose the integrity of our material. This is a much better system than simply drilling some wood screws, risk destruction on a bad calculation, and have the weight bare completely where the screws would anchor (using small screws risk a lack of strength, using long screws risk chewing up the boards). After verifying that the bolt holes and cross dowel nuts lined up we spray painted the inside flat black and moved on to working on the accessories.\n        ", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQX/JRD7/GYZNVOMQ/FQXJRD7GYZNVOMQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS5/7CA2/GYZNVOMT/FS57CA2GYZNVOMT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZB/4GEZ/GYVDJ80Y/FZB4GEZGYVDJ80Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNS/60W7/GZ0MMCFJ/FNS60W7GZ0MMCFJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEU/4C2K/GZ38JCAQ/FEU4C2KGZ38JCAQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCO/MIJW/GZ38JCAR/FCOMIJWGZ38JCAR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRT/SKHY/GZ0BVYVZ/FRTSKHYGZ0BVYVZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Building the Box"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Luckily the power supply we used had an on/off switch so we simply shorted the power supply Power On and Power Good cables on the 24-pin connector and controlled the power function with the switch.

After the paint dried, we salvaged a length of vacuum hose that was going to the garbage and cut it in lengths that would make a nice arc when mounted on top of the box. We cut two tabs on the hose for the AC side and just a straight cut for the DC side.\nWe began putting it all back together and, before closing, we passed the power cables through the DC hose and wedged it in the area where the cables exited the PSU.

One of the first ideas suggested was adding some lights to accent the design. After spending some time on the instructables website we came across a link by Junophor\u00a0on the construction of a Steampunk Light Tube.\nUsing his design as inspiration, we took some small halogen bulbs from the dollar store and cut off the ends with the dremel using a diamond bit cutoff wheel. We then used tweezers to pull out the filament from the tube. Your end result should be a hollow glass tube.NOTE: When cutting glass with a cutoff wheel ensure that you keep the glass and wheel wet. Excessive heat can crack the glass and ruin the material, potentially causing harm. ALWAYS USE PROTECTIVE EYEWEAR AND A MASK TO AVOID BREATHING IN THE GLASS DUST!\nWe then used the brass sockets from broken down bulbs (similar to Junophor\u2019s instructable) to use as end caps for the glass tube. We drilled out the ends of the socket with a bit that would snugly fit the LEDs in place and glued them in.\nOur next step was to find a way to give the light tube a great shine. After some tinkering with filling the tubes we discovered that glue sticks reacted nicely to the UV rays of the LEDs and dispersed the light brightly and evenly. Also, the LEDs would not get hot enough to melt the glue sticks. So we stuffed a glue stick in each tube and glued the end caps on.\nNow that we had the light tubes built and sealed we had to attach the wiring to each LED so that we could run them upon installation. Considering we had exposed wiring, we had to figure out a way to dress them up with respect to the theme. So, we wired up the LEDs and used heat shrink tube to insulate the wires, giving them a more pleasing aesthetic. We then coiled up some brass colored wire on a bolt and made a spring that would then be placed on the outside of the insulation to give it that \u201cSteampunk\u201d look. All that was left for the tubes was to find a power source, which we decided to use the computer power supply that was running the amp\u2019s upgraded fans.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5Z/NG66/GZ0BW3FF/F5ZNG66GZ0BW3FF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXI/0DHZ/GZ0BVYRB/FXI0DHZGZ0BVYRB.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Steampunk Light Tubes"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "In our attempt to use recycled materials and keeping our means of construction based on availability, we realized that we did not have access to a variety of gears and cogs. Our first thought was to make our own, but our main challenges were the material to use and the method in which to make them. I found some CAD files online that had 4 different sized gears that worked together. Without having a 3d printer or other machining tool we were unable to produce an accurate replica. I converted the files to a image file and printed them as a stencil for the project.\nWe started off with papercraft gears, similar to the ones found here. Papercraft would provide cogs that would be easy to cut, would fit perfectly, and would ensure if one was spun the rest would follow. Unfortunately, even after using heavy cardstock, the gears were simply too weak and did not show promise of standing the test of time. It was especially unfortunate that the paper became soggy and buckled when trying to paint.\nNext we looked into building a foam factory and shaping the cogs out of foam. Our first problem out the gate with this approach was our unsuccessful attempt at building the foam factory, mainly due to time constraints and the lack of availability of the Nichrome wire needed. Using a razor blade we attempted anyway and, while the cogs did roughly interlock and spin, the foam was simply unsightly and far too brittle to be considered a permanent solution. Painting the foam only reaffirmed our doubts.\nWe moved on to the most promising possibility\u2026 wood. Of course, yet another issue, the lack of a band saw and difficulty in cutting led us to another defeat. The angle left by the table saw gave the gears a nice look, but working with the table saw to cut out the gears was not only dangerous but proved to be inaccurate. It was clear at this point that we would have to move on to something that was more readily available.\nThat is when we came across a trashed rear wheel of a hybrid road bike. Using a hammer, screwdriver, dremel, and quite possibly the largest amount of testosterone ever displayed in a garage, we were able to break apart and separate each individual gear (without the use of the proprietary tool needed). A quick trip to the local Lowes, 5 minutes before closing, yielded JB Weld, 8 washers, and 4 bolts with 8 matching nuts; a total of about 15 bucks (including 2 Mountain Dews on the bill).\nWe dug into a bin of used/broken fishing reel parts and pulled out a reel handle and matching nut, main drive gear, and pinion gear. Using JB Weld and Loctite we sandwiched a bike sprocket in between two washers, ran the pinion gear through it and added the main drive gear on the other side with JB Weld. We affixed the handle on the pinion gear with the nut and Loctite. We sandwiched 3 other gears, each in between two washers, ran a bolt thru them, and locked them in with Loctite. Albeit a compromise, after two days, the gears were finally finished.\nHaving a CNC Router would have produced a better result and would have yielded an even greater final project.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F3V/DYBS/GZ0MMCN1/F3VDYBSGZ0MMCN1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSA/6Y52/GZ0MMCEX/FSA6Y52GZ0MMCEX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIT/WA3Y/GZ0JIFEZ/FITWA3YGZ0JIFEZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNO/HEHM/GYZNVOI5/FNOHEHMGYZNVOI5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4R/QLPB/GYZNVOMM/F4RQLPBGYZNVOMM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXQ/JT7V/GZ38JC4I/FXQJT7VGZ38JC4I.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3C/41I9/GZ38JC4K/F3C41I9GZ38JC4K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMX/1DG0/GYVDJ81U/FMX1DG0GYVDJ81U.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: The Gear Fiasco"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "We started the finishing process by placing the cross dowel nuts and their respective bolts in place.

This would give us a nice window look when the doors are closed, but allowed they could still open for us to access the posterior of the DJ components. We applied a quick coat of copper paint, light enough to allow the wood grain to show but still keep it within the theme.\nThe recessed lighting cover was also painted in the same manner as with the PSU done earlier.\u00a0We then mounted the recessed lighting cover with some L-brackets onto one of the barn doors. Once we had the right fit and the recessed lighting cover (now door window) was attached, we attached the door to the leather-bound box using hinges salvaged from a kitchen remodel.\nUsing some beat up old belts with some painted buckles we made the doors lock, keeping them in a closed position but still able to open at any given time.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FUB/O5R7/GZ0BVYWA/FUBO5R7GZ0BVYWA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDB/X1WD/GYZNVOPP/FDBX1WDGYZNVOPP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWB/US11/GYVDJ81L/FWBUS11GYVDJ81L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO9/M9NA/GYVDJ81K/FO9M9NAGYVDJ81K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F97/F8MI/GZ0MMCFT/F97F8MIGZ0MMCFT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCN/SEM1/GZ0BVYWF/FCNSEM1GZ0BVYWF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZH/5TZV/GZ38JCBP/FZH5TZVGZ38JCBP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F24/M4HC/GYVDJ81Q/F24M4HCGYVDJ81Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4T/DD5E/GYVDJ81P/F4TDD5EGYVDJ81P.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Barn Doors"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "We began by installing the lamp. We took the power cord off of the lamp assembly in order to hide the cable. After passing the loose ends through the hole we attached it back on the lamp assembly and a simple nut attached the lamp to the box. With the countersinking, the lamp looked as if it had been affixed by original design.\nThe PSU cables went through the pre-drilled holes first and the hoses fit snugly. We opted out of gluing them in place and cut some L shaped drywall corner bead \u2018straps\u2019 that would fit around the top and sides of the PSU with four 3/4\u201d self tapping wood screws to secure it. The straps had been painted a slightly darker color and left misshapen to give off a rougher look. The straps themselves were fitted to the PSU using its own bolts from the top cover.\nWe placed some decorative washers and brass bolts on the L-brackets and added some hex bolts with washers to hold up the weight-bearing brackets for the second amp.\nThe gears were mounted through the box and held in place with a nut. We applied a copious amount of super glue on the nut inside to prevent it from tightening or loosening up. This kept the gears moving freely, without wearing the box at contact. Once the gears were mounted, we routed a rusted bike chain (cut to size) throughout the sprockets for that mechanical element.\nFinally, we installed the light tubes that were constructed earlier in the project. We used a 1/4\" drill bit to make holes for the wiring, which were connected in the interior to the PSU. Hot glue was applied to the inside of the barn doors to fasten the light tubes and make sure they remained in place. After that, the only thing left was to install the amps, run all the wiring, hook up the sounds, and let the party begin!\nAnd Thus, the TRAVELING STEAMPUNK DJ CABINET is complete!Final Thoughts\nNot only was this project fun to build, it also produced a great looking end product. We met our goal to recycle, reuse, and spend as little as possible on this project. The Steampunk cabinet has received very positive feedback when it has been used in gigs.We would like to return to this project and replace the sprockets with precisely cut, more decorative gears.\u00a0Winning the ShopBot Challenge would allow us to do that, and greatly validate our efforts.

Some people do crazy things http://www.ledcontrol.narod.ru/eng/index.htm .One problem building such a clock is to find a motor. The motor has to be silent, it has to make more than 25 turns per second and the power for the clock circuit has to be transfered somehow to the pov pcb that is mounted on the turning spindle of the motor. Bob used a motor from an old floppy disk drive in his project. He modified the motor to use an extra coil as a generator for powering of the circuit. The motor that bob used was a non regulated one from a very old floppy disc drive. These are hard to find nowadays and the speed is not very stable.Daryl bender http://www3.sympatico.ca/surfin.dude/creative/clocks/propclk/blick.html also modified a motor. Other people transferred the power using brushes. Brushes make noise, give bad contact and are ugly ...

The thinner strip of wood was not used on my project, because I tested it against the darker plywood next to it and that turned out to be more flexible.While the wood was soaking, I got to work on the front face of the body. I do not own a jigsaw, bowsaw, coping saw or scrollsaw, so I had to use a combination of a drill and a hacksaw to cut out my desired shape. To plot the shape onto the wood, I simply drew lots of lines on it (picture two) in the computer model and using those measurements, re-drew the body onto the plywood sheet. It's a time-consuming way to cut it out, but I didn't have an alternative available.Then, to round off the very rough untidy edges, I stuck a cork onto a drill bit and glued a rectangular piece of 100 grit sandpaper around it with cyanoacrylate glue, and used this like a belt sander with pretty good results.Then, once this was done, I wanted to try bending the now flexible wood around it. But first, I had to cut the soaked wood strip down the middle to get the correct thickness. using only a hacksaw and sandpaper made this challenging, but I surprised myself with the results. After a little bit of sanding, both halves were pretty straight on the edges.When I tried to bend the wood to fit the body shape, it just wasn't flexible enough, so I hatched another plan to get around that. I made hundreds of little parallel cuts with a hacksaw (perpendicular to the long edges) and only on the side of the wood that would be inside the body, not visible on the finished product. I made more cuts in the areas that needed tighter bends, so that the bend would look less angular. I then placed the two wood strips on top of the body and bent them the way I wanted them to be, and clamped them there to dry in that shape. But, knowing that the wood would try \"spring\" out when I took the clamps off, I bent the curves a bit more sharply than they are on the body. I left this overnight to dry.After the wood had dried, I took the clamps off, and then put glue into all the little hacksaw cuts I had made, then clamped the wood back to the body as before. The wood glue made the wood strips much stronger, and also helped to make sure it would keep its shape. The sides of the guitar's body were roughly complete.At this point I had other things to do, so I left my project for a few weeks. The rest of the pictures are from when I returned to work on my guitar.

I left the last 160 mm of the neck as it was, because it was to become the head later on.I connected the points I had marked to be widths of the neck at both ends, using a pencil and a long set square, and used these pencil lines as a guide so that I knew where not to cut.I made cuts into the wood from the sides, using a hacksaw, to the desired depth. I then used a chisel I made from a piece of a desk back in high school, to break off these segments of wood by splitting them off. The pictures explain this better than I can.Once the length of the neck was done, I used a carving knife on my Leatherman Multitool and a wood plane to neaten up the edges where I had chiseled the wood away, and also started making a rough cross section on the neck. It's important that nothing happens on the head section of the guitar at this point. It must remain absolutely flat.At this point I decided to try out possible fretboards I could make, with the wood I had with me.

It's also important that the wood is the right thickness and is properly flat, or the machine heads will not fit properly and it will not look nearly as good.The head of the guitar draws attention to itself, so mistakes here are to be avoided more strictly than in most other areas.Starting off with the plank I shaped into the neck, I cut off a part of another plank of the same width and height. The length of this block was 160 mm. I then glued it to the back of the existing \"head\" portion of the neck, clamped it, and left the glue to dry for a day and a half. If there is any gap between the two pieces of wood being glued together, there is a good chance that upon tuning the guitar the head will split and break.Once this glue was properly dry, I drew on it with a pencil as shown in the third picture. The perpendicular distance between the pencil lines must be between 15 and 18 mm, because this is the thickness that most machine heads are made to fit through. The angle between the front flat surface of the neck and the \"bent\" head is somewhere between 9 and 12 degrees on my guitar (I didn't have a protractor to measure).Next, using a set square, I drew lines around the head as shown in picture number four. These lines will act as planes of intersection, so that we can use a hacksaw to neatly cut to an even and flat surface.Next, I cut along these lines and stopped when the hacksaw was about 1 mm from touching my pencil lines that mark the top and bottom of the head. Pictures 5 and 6 show this much better than I can explain it.Then, I used my homemade chisel again like a crow bar, to remove chunks of wood outside of the pencil lines. It is VERY important to split the wood \"down\" the \"slope\" of the head, because if we were to split it from the bottom up, it would create a split in the wood we need to conserve. This is tough to explain in words, but picture 7 describes what I mean. Once the majority of the excess wood is removed, it should end up looking like stairs. Now, using two hand planes (I used the smaller one almost exclusively) I worked again \"down\" the slope, and got rid of the steps in the wood. It took a few hours of planing, and I did also use my carving knife for some stubborn wood chunks that were tough to plane through, but after planing it was smooth enough that the head only required minimal sanding.At this point it looked kind of like a paddle, so I needed to give it its final shape. I measured my 3D computer model and re-drew the shape I had designed onto the wood surface. I then used the hacksaw and my carving knife again to carve chunks from the sides. I ended up using the knife more than the little wood plane because the sides were too small to access with it. Then, I used the drill with the sandpaper cork on it to make the rounded edges neater and sanded the head with 220 grit sandpaper.I also marked where the six holes would need to be drilled to be able to fit the machine heads, but I'll explain that part a bit later on.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZB/GCQC/IKRNIJ1U/FZBGCQCIKRNIJ1U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSO/713P/IKRNIJ21/FSO713PIKRNIJ21.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLM/2KZV/IKRNIJ2S/FLM2KZVIKRNIJ2S.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPI/RP72/IKRNIJ2Z/FPIRP72IKRNIJ2Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQE/Y00S/IKRNIJ3B/FQEY00SIKRNIJ3B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMM/T4L1/IKRNIJ3Q/FMMT4L1IKRNIJ3Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWM/XP9R/IKRNIJ3V/FWMXP9RIKRNIJ3V.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU3/ELWC/IKRNIJ3X/FU3ELWCIKRNIJ3X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP2/NAPO/IKRNIJ40/FP2NAPOIKRNIJ40.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM7/HUAL/IKRNIJ46/FM7HUALIKRNIJ46.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1H/2ILT/IKRNIJ4T/F1H2ILTIKRNIJ4T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCE/5KWS/IKRNIJ59/FCE5KWSIKRNIJ59.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFN/8WRR/IKRNIJ5P/FFN8WRRIKRNIJ5P.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ7/X70S/IKRNIJ7G/FZ7X70SIKRNIJ7G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1U/L6ZT/IKRNIJ7L/F1UL6ZTIKRNIJ7L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJO/T35D/IKRNIJ7P/FJOT35DIKRNIJ7P.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKL/LM32/IKRNIJ80/FKLLM32IKRNIJ80.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSG/QW9R/IKRNIJ86/FSGQW9RIKRNIJ86.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: The Head"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "To mount the bridge of the guitar directly to the hollow body would not be a good idea because it would rip straight out or break the body. So, we have to strengthen the body from the inside so that the bridge may be screwed in securely. I did this by extending the neck within the body, but below the actual neck-plank. This was to allow space for the electric pickup inside the body.I cut a piece of wood 330 mm long to use as the main part of this bracing, with the same width and thickness as the neck plank. The end 50 mm of this wooden block was cut to the same thickness as the base of the neck using a hacksaw, and cut to be roughly rounded. I then used a hacksaw and a carving knife to give this shape the rough compound curves shown in pictures 3 and 4. After this, I used the drill and the sandpaper cork again to do most of the neatening up of these curves, and I think it came out pretty well.Only the end 50mm is visible in the final guitar. The rest needed to be made about 3 mm thinner so it could neatly fit into the existing body. I used much the same technique as I used on the head, with a hacksaw followed by chiseling, then wood planing. This part was very time consuming, but this surface had to be completely flat or it would have been impossible to glue the bottom part of the body to it, which is what needs to happen.Once I was happy with this piece, I test fitted it to the rest of the parts I had roughly made, and it seemed to fit well so I moved onto the next step in making the bracing structure, attatching this wood block to the neck. I then placed it in exactly the right place, clamped it there, and drilled four holes through the two planks (not all the way through, though) as shown. I screwed in four screws and they held it very strongly. I then used my carving knife and sandpaper to blend the two pieces of wood together nicely so that there was no noticeable seam.  Then, I unscrewed the screws and covered the shown area with wood glue, before screwing them back in to hold the pieces of wood together tightly and permanently.Next, I cut another piece of the same kind of wood to the dimensions of about 130mm x 17mm x 35 mm. I then glued and screwed this piece of wood to the bracing as shown in the last two pictures.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ4/J0EI/IKRNIJ2B/FZ4J0EIIKRNIJ2B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTP/03RP/IKRNIJ2I/FTP03RPIKRNIJ2I.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUW/19WH/IKRNIJ60/FUW19WHIKRNIJ60.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F97/A7R6/IKRNIJ64/F97A7R6IKRNIJ64.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDA/D4XD/IKRNIJ65/FDAD4XDIKRNIJ65.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3Z/3PT4/IKRNIJ6E/F3Z3PT4IKRNIJ6E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB3/MUWX/IKRNIJ6T/FB3MUWXIKRNIJ6T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPO/8I17/IKRNIJ70/FPO8I17IKRNIJ70.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQK/F3KQ/IKRNIJ78/FQKF3KQIKRNIJ78.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRZ/WCVO/IKRNIJ7E/FRZWCVOIKRNIJ7E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQY/1I7F/IKSKXLV2/FQY1I7FIKSKXLV2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAC/ZODN/IKSKXLVM/FACZODNIKSKXLVM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2I/QH45/IKSKXMC8/F2IQH45IKSKXMC8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F49/NV80/IKSKXLW8/F49NV80IKSKXLW8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUP/1R86/IKSKXLWE/FUP1R86IKSKXLWE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLS/S1WK/IKSKXM4B/FLSS1WKIKSKXM4B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB6/UQA1/IKSKXMNQ/FB6UQA1IKSKXMNQ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Internal Bracing"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "Making the electric pickup is fairly simple in concept, but it took me a whole day to make this one. I don't want to make this step too complicated, so I decided to simplify it and have it all on this one page. There are also other instructables that show you how to make a pickup, I have found them useful before.I started off with two magnets. They had to have the same pole alignment, but could not be placed together facing the same way because they would repel each other, so to fix this I cut a piece of steel 3mm thick to fit neatly between the two magnets. This allowed them to be placed together as shown in picture 2, essentially forming one magnet.I cut the steel door piece (picture 3) in half, and placed the halves together as shown in picture 5.I then cut the two plastic parts of the pickup frame, the internal one being white and the visible one black. The slots in the centre of the plastic parts are for the steel plates to be wedged and glued into, so they should fit tightly. I used a soldering iron and a hacksaw to cut out the plastic parts. The internal plastic part (the white one) has an extended side so that holes can be made through which we will solder wires later on. The holes must be at least 7 mm from where the outside of the copper coil will be. Make these holes now. Glue the parts together, so that they form a cross section like this: \"l--l\" The steel plates should be flush with the plastic at both ends.Next up, comes the winding. I made a basic rig using a cork and toothpicks to temporarily glue the pickup frame to a drill, to make the winding process go by much faster.Next, I wound up the coil off a large spool of copper wire I had, using the drill. It took a long time because I did it slowly. The copper must not be pulled too tightly or it will snap, and you'll have to make a new pickup. The direction of the winding doesn't matter with a single pickup like this. Before winding, tape about 100 mm of the wire off to the side of the pickup where it is out of the way and can be soldered later on.I didn't count the winds, I just wound the pickup until it had as many winds as I could fit. I then used a scalpel to scratch off the end 30mm of both ends of the pickup coil wire, to get rid of the enamel coating. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.Wrap these non-insulated edges through the holes as shown. Next, get some ordinary copper electrical wire and cut two lengths, each one about 450mm long. Remove the protective rubber insulation off the end 10mm or so at both ends of both wires. Scratch the exposed copper wire to make it more conductive.Thread one end of each wire into either hole as shown, and solder it in place in the holes. Now comes the weird part, the complete pickup must be inserted into a container and be flooded with hot wax, and the air must be sucked out of this container so that the wax is pulled into the gaps between the copper coils in the pickup. This is necessary to prevent something called \"microphonics\" which is basically unwanted feedback being picked up by a pickup. It also helps to insulate the entire pickup.I used a mayonnaise jar with a hole in the lid, and a rubber pipe glued into this hole so that the edges were airtight. I broke up two basic paraffin candles and put the wax chunks into the jar. I then put the jar in a pot of water and boiled it until all the wax in the jar had liquefied. I placed the pickup inside the jar, making sure the wires didn't get into the wax. I screwed the lid on and sucked the air out the best I could with my mouth (since I don't have a compressor), and some bubbles came out of the coil, which is a good sign because that meant wax was being sucked in where that air was.After I did this for about 5-10 minutes to make sure I got as much wax in and air out as possible, I then took the pickup out of the wax. I very quickly wiped the wax off the top black plastic with a tissue so that I wouldn't need to scrape it off later. I did the same to the bottom of the pickup, so that there wouldn't be wax between the magnets and the white plastic/steel. I left the pickup to cool down for a few minutes and allowed the wax to solidify within the coil.After this, I used black insulation tape around the visible copper coil to protect the copper from being accidentally scratched and short-circuiting. Refer to the last two photographs in this step if you're confused at all.Then, stick the two magnets to the bottom of the pickup. They should stick there well enough by themselves to the steel, but once they are in place I recommend using a hot glue gun to just keep them from wiggling out of place or detaching if the guitar is dropped.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F89/BFT1/IKSKYBAF/F89BFT1IKSKYBAF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5C/2MQW/IKSKYBBF/F5C2MQWIKSKYBBF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMK/2943/IKSKY8NE/FMK2943IKSKY8NE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLE/UIC6/IKSKY8OV/FLEUIC6IKSKY8OV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAW/DF0C/IKSKY8P1/FAWDF0CIKSKY8P1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0B/FUKF/IKSKY8N8/F0BFUKFIKSKY8N8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F75/WD98/IKSKY8Q8/F75WD98IKSKY8Q8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUC/0XPB/IKSKY8RG/FUC0XPBIKSKY8RG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3C/1F9X/IKSKY8RS/F3C1F9XIKSKY8RS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV7/CSK4/IKSKY8SP/FV7CSK4IKSKY8SP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY8/IQWE/IKSKY8WJ/FY8IQWEIKSKY8WJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FT8/S50F/IKSKY8XH/FT8S50FIKSKY8XH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHY/MVEX/IKSKY8XM/FHYMVEXIKSKY8XM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSI/9I5F/IKSKY8XP/FSI9I5FIKSKY8XP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSO/BGAO/IKSKY8XU/FSOBGAOIKSKY8XU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5B/6G9S/IKSKY8Y7/F5B6G9SIKSKY8Y7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZV/TOC6/IKSKY8YI/FZVTOC6IKSKY8YI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMR/B84Z/IKSKY8YW/FMRB84ZIKSKY8YW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXA/R1U0/IKSKY8ZC/FXAR1U0IKSKY8ZC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYT/PEUG/IKSKY8ZM/FYTPEUGIKSKY8ZM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3L/L1ZF/IKSKY931/F3LL1ZFIKSKY931.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1I/0T77/IKSKY97K/F1I0T77IKSKY97K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBV/O4I9/IKSKY98H/FBVO4I9IKSKY98H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKM/R69E/IKSKY99D/FKMR69EIKSKY99D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQD/YS39/IKSKY9AM/FQDYS39IKSKY9AM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5U/37MF/IKSKY9AU/F5U37MFIKSKY9AU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQZ/2TK5/IKSKY9CC/FQZ2TK5IKSKY9CC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSQ/H5DM/IKSKY9DX/FSQH5DMIKSKY9DX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFV/9NHX/IKSKY9G1/FFV9NHXIKSKY9G1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCX/VMXY/IKSKYXX8/FCXVMXYIKSKYXX8.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Making the Electric Pickup"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Now that the neck is attatched to the structural reinforcement of the body and the shaping of the head is done, the neck must be properly shaped. You can look up guitar neck cross-sections online, there are many variations to suit different playing styles. My neck had to be pretty thick, though, compared to most electric guitars. This is because mine lacks a truss rod, which is an adjustable metal rod that runs through the whole neck to prevent it from bending when the strings are tightened.I used a carving knife, then wood planes, then sandpaper of 100 and 220 grit roughness to shape the neck smoothly and blend it into the bottom of the head.Next, I drilled the six holes required in the head for the machine heads to be placed in. I don't have a drill press, so I couldn't do this part accurately in one go. I used a 5mm diameter drill bit and drilled perpendicular to the front face of the head in the six marked spots. I then used an 8mm and a 9mm drill bit to make the holes the correct diameter, but made appropriate adjustments from my initial drilling angles which were slightly off.I test-fitted the machine heads, and made small adjustments with a hand file until all six could fit snug in the holes. I then removed them again.I used 800 grit sandpaper to smooth the surface, get rid of any scratches, and prepare it for painting. I did the same to the whole neck and the back and sides of the head, because they were soon to be varnished.Then, I designed the colour scheme and name that I would paint on the head, and used paper to test it out roughly and have an idea of how it would look. I then re-drew my design onto the wood itself. Once that was done, I painted in the different areas as neatly as I could, and used a scalpel to remove paint where I accidentally painted outside of my pencil borders. This took a very long time.Once the paint was properly dry, I sanded it with 800 grit sandpaper to make it of an even thickness all over.Next, I varnished the entire neck and head. I placed some bits of toilet paper in the holes in the head so that varnish wouldn't run from one side to the other and cause drip marks or inconsistent thicknesses in the varnish.The varnish I used took over 24 hours to dry each time, which slowed my project down drastically.On my third coat of varnish on the head, I used some thinners with the varnish to make a thinner top coat, so that the surface would be flatter. This seeped down through the other layers and reacted badly with the craft paint and dry varnish I used, so I had to rub off all the varnish and do it again. This time, I did about 12 coats of varnish over more than a week, and after each one I would use 800 grit sandpaper for 40 minutes or so to smooth the surface for the next coat.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FPG/9PCJ/IKSKY8MQ/FPG9PCJIKSKY8MQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRL/Y8SS/IKSKYYNL/FRLY8SSIKSKYYNL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJK/FXZZ/IKSKYYNN/FJKFXZZIKSKYYNN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBD/65EH/IKSKYYOJ/FBD65EHIKSKYYOJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKU/Q5R0/IKSKYYOQ/FKUQ5R0IKSKYYOQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHI/Z62B/IKSKYYOX/FHIZ62BIKSKYYOX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVS/5U7Q/IKSKYYP4/FVS5U7QIKSKYYP4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGQ/PBV8/IKSKYYPB/FGQPBV8IKSKYYPB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJD/L9AY/IKSKYYPC/FJDL9AYIKSKYYPC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRH/DRF0/IKSKZ4QO/FRHDRF0IKSKZ4QO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMK/89JP/IKSKZ4QS/FMK89JPIKSKZ4QS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F11/WVZN/IKSKYYPH/F11WVZNIKSKYYPH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7H/4LA7/IKSKZ4QY/F7H4LA7IKSKZ4QY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOF/8V3L/IKSKZ4R3/FOF8V3LIKSKZ4R3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9Z/MS45/IKSKZ4R9/F9ZMS45IKSKZ4R9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOO/8GYP/IKSKZ4RV/FOO8GYPIKSKZ4RV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNO/T9P1/IKSKZ4RQ/FNOT9P1IKSKZ4RQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAU/63QX/IKSKZ4RU/FAU63QXIKSKZ4RU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHI/H401/IKSKZ98F/FHIH401IKSKZ98F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAQ/P039/IKSKZ99G/FAQP039IKSKZ99G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHG/JTMP/IKSKZ9AW/FHGJTMPIKSKZ9AW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM6/H674/IKSKZ9BX/FM6H674IKSKZ9BX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3H/FMJ9/IKSKZ9CZ/F3HFMJ9IKSKZ9CZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR7/3ZPL/IKSKZ9E4/FR73ZPLIKSKZ9E4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR2/TBWT/IKSKZ9F4/FR2TBWTIKSKZ9F4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKY/IHHE/IKSKZ9G6/FKYIHHEIKSKZ9G6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOZ/YH0E/IKSKZ9H6/FOZYH0EIKSKZ9H6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM8/LWFY/IKSKZ9I6/FM8LWFYIKSKZ9I6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ5/X3YV/IKSKZ9J7/FZ5X3YVIKSKZ9J7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDA/P5V6/IKSKZ9J8/FDAP5V6IKSKZ9J8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHM/1OHR/IKSKZ9L7/FHM1OHRIKSKZ9L7.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Neck and Head (continued)"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "First, I drilled a hole in the centre of the side of the body furthest from the neck. This hole was made for the mounting of the output jack. Do not permanently mount it yet, though. Because my guitar had thin sides, I reinforced this part with another piece of offcut wood and drilled a hole through that, too, you can see this in the 5th picture. This just makes it harder to accidentally rip out the jack and wiring when you try to unplug your guitar.To do the wiring, I followed the last diagram found on this page:  http://www.seymourduncan.com/blog/the-tone-garage...I have copied this image and put it in with my photographs in this step, just in case the Seymour Duncan website goes down temporarily or anything like that.I drilled the two small holes in the front face of the body for my potentiometers to stick through, and I loosely placed them in these holes to make soldering them easier. Solder everything in the diagram besides the output jack. Referring to the URL I have linked will help, it explains what is going on in the diagram.I de-soldered a 401 ceramic capacitor from a motor as seen in the second picture. I then used this in place of the .047 one in the wiring diagram, as it was the closest capacitor I could find at home. I got the motor out of a broken remote-controlled toy car.Temporarily attatch the output jack to the circuit for testing, I just used insulation tape. There is no need to solder, that only gives you more work to do.Once all this was done, I tested it. I have embedded a video in this step showing my test, in this test I used a tiny portable pocket amplifier and ran it through my computer speakers, because I didn't have a proper amp at the time. I placed two wooden blocks on an existing acoustic steel-stringed guitar, and put the pickup on top of them, above the strings. When I turned the pocket amp on and plucked the strings, I could hear the guitar very well through the speakers, so it worked. This is also a good time to test your volume and tone knobs.Once this was done, I cut out a hole in the front face of the body so that the pickup could be fitted from inside with the top black plastic part sticking through neatly. I did this by drilling lots of holes, using a hacksaw blade removed from the hacksaw, and the sandpaper cork on the drill. A hand file and carving knife also came in handy.After that was done, I glued the sides of the body onto the back of the front face. I did this in 3 parts because I don't have that many clamps. After this was done, I made the remainder of the guitar side areas with little blocks of wood. These blocks were an 8mm x 8mm firework stick that I cut into about 18 equally long pieces, then planed to fit tightly together. After that, I glued them all on as shown. I only did this because I didn't have enough plywood to go all the way around the body. I trimmed this wood until it looked neat, and so that the neck could fit tightly between the sides.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F3W/PXFM/IKSKZDQZ/F3WPXFMIKSKZDQZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ8/5PR5/IKSKZDON/FZ85PR5IKSKZDON.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7G/OREW/IKSKZDPJ/F7GOREWIKSKZDPJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F85/2N9G/IKSKZDQ0/F852N9GIKSKZDQ0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQC/2TPP/IKRNOBTP/FQC2TPPIKRNOBTP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAP/0TWH/IKRNOMZJ/FAP0TWHIKRNOMZJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY4/TRQ3/IKRNOMYZ/FY4TRQ3IKRNOMYZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQH/A51N/IKRNON01/FQHA51NIKRNON01.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE1/H57C/IKRNON0D/FE1H57CIKRNON0D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F65/EV6S/IKSKZDNU/F65EV6SIKSKZDNU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXF/0JZQ/IKSKZDRZ/FXF0JZQIKSKZDRZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF2/GK9S/IKSKZDTZ/FF2GK9SIKSKZDTZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5M/OU4K/IKSKZDSU/F5MOU4KIKSKZDSU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Body Construction and Wiring"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "This step will only cover the construction of the fret board itself, and the inlays. I'll explain putting the frets in in a later one.Before starting my fret board, I bought some Fender standard fret wire, 24 pre-cut frets cost me the equivalent of about US$10 or so. I would have preferred a cheaper roll of wire, but had nowhere near me to buy it in that form.I started with a thin pine offcut about 60mm long, 7mm thick and 45 mm wide. I recommend using wood wider than this, though, as it eliminates the need for binding or in my case, wooden \"wings\" to make it wider.I used wood planes on the sides of my fret board to taper it slightly towards one end, so that my 'wings' would go all the way to the end, then 220 grit to 800 grit sandpaper for a few hours, to give the top surface of the wood a radius. If you're luckier than me and do not have to make additions to your initial piece of wood, you will still need to taper it to fit flush with the neck. If you're not sure what the radius should look like, look for guitar fret board radius cross-sections online. They vary from instrument to instrument, so choose a radius that you think will suit your style of playing. There should be no bumps or dips in the surface when you look along the top and hold it as shown in pictures 3,4 and 5. The wood is shiny in these pictures purely from the fine sandpaper, there is no oil or varnish on it.I then cut it to the correct length, in my guitar's case that was 508mm.Next up, I used two pieces of wood, about 8x8mm square in cross section and 700mm long. I cut them to the same length as the main part of the fret board and used wood planes and sandpaper to taper them at one end, so that they would fit approximately flush with the edges of the neck. I then glued and clamped these wood strips to the sides of the main part of the fret board, using four clamps and a couple rubber bands. Once this glue was dry (about 8 hours later) I added another part, cut from the same pieces of wood, shown in the picture directly after the one showing the clamping, at the wider part of the fret board. The ends of this piece were then sanded down to be flush with the outside wood strips. I didn't worry about clamping it, but I did leave it for a few hours to dry properly before proceeding.I sanded and planed the strips to all be flush on the surface and underside with the wood, and ensured that the radius remained uniform on both the main piece of wood and the outside strips.Then, I added some paint. I masked off the main piece of wood, and painted the three parts I had added. I took the masking tape off while the paint was wet, otherwise it would have likely been messed up when I peeled the tape off. I painted over the paint with another layer, just to cover up any patches where it was too thin.Once the paint was dry, I made cuts in the wood in which to insert my fret marker \"inlays\". I didn't have any materials suitable for making convincing inlays of a colour I liked, so I cut shapes out of the fret board about 1-2mm deep and filled them with red paint. Before I could do this, I had to know where the markers needed to be. I calculated where my frets would be using this online fret calculator: https://www.stewmac.com/FretCalculatorMy scale length was not absolutely certain at this point, but as long as you are within 3mm above or below the final position, your markers won't look very out of place. The frets need to be absolutely precise later on, but the markers don't have to be perfect for the guitar to function. I marked only very lightly in pencil where the frets would be and used a plastic stencil I made to assist in making all the markers the same. I centered the stencil for each fret that needed a marker and made a cut for the outline of the shape, then I removed the stencil, cut the outlines a bit deeper, then chiseled the diamond shapes out using the same craft knife.Look up standard fret marker locations if you're not sure where the markers should be.I then filled these shapes with paint, but to ensure that the paint dried faster and evenly through each marker, I painted in layers and only once each layer was dry, I would paint the next one over it. Try to keep your painting neat, but you can remove excess paint a little later.Once all the cutouts have been filled with paint and are flush with the wood surface, Use fine sandpaper to remove the excess that is on top of the wood where it shouldn't be. The last few pictures show how I did this and how it worked out pretty well for me.When I was happy with the surface of my fret board, I varnished it. I didn't use a paintbrush, I only wanted a very thin layer of varnish that would protect the wood by seeping into it very slightly, and not being thick enough to make it permanently glossy as this would interfere with playing and look awful after some time playing the guitar. I used 2 ply toilet paper (because it holds together well and doesn't leave dust) to apply some varnish to the fret board, then wiped it \"off\" again. It's impossible to really wipe varnish off, so all this does is removes most of the surface varnish and lets only a small amount stay behind, which will be flatter and more practical for this application. This must be done quickly though, to avoid any ugly smears or bubbles in the texture. Leave the fret board somewhere where it's unlikely to get dust, pollen or hair on it while it dries.After a day or more, when the varnish is dry, inspect the fret board for any areas that may have defects, and try to fix those at this point. For example if there is a hair stuck in the surface, remove it and if a noticeable outline remains, use some varnish on your finger to lightly patch the area up and smooth it off, and wait again for that to dry. Patience is important with varnish, as I've learned the hard way more than once.Once the fret board was complete, I marked on the body where I would need to cut out a place for the wide end of the fret board to fit. There is no picture of me making this cut, but you can see the difference in the next step's pictures.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ2/6JQN/IKRNOS1F/FQ26JQNIKRNOS1F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F58/ELOD/IKRNOS36/F58ELODIKRNOS36.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWE/VLO7/IKRNOS2N/FWEVLO7IKRNOS2N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIL/HTMC/IKRNOS1S/FILHTMCIKRNOS1S.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBH/1CWC/IKRNOS3C/FBH1CWCIKRNOS3C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXE/KKPA/IKY6IKG9/FXEKKPAIKY6IKG9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX5/Q8QI/IKRNOS4L/FX5Q8QIIKRNOS4L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0D/4AXO/IKRNOS4S/F0D4AXOIKRNOS4S.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN6/KYV1/IKRNOS50/FN6KYV1IKRNOS50.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7Q/E2VG/IKY6IKGH/F7QE2VGIKY6IKGH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE3/E4U1/IKRNOS57/FE3E4U1IKRNOS57.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGO/LL44/IKRNOS63/FGOLL44IKRNOS63.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDE/9DA4/IKRNOS6C/FDE9DA4IKRNOS6C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9E/9K7S/IKRNOS6D/F9E9K7SIKRNOS6D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOS/7EZR/IKRNOS6E/FOS7EZRIKRNOS6E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHI/TJTG/IKRNOS6I/FHITJTGIKRNOS6I.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPD/KR4K/IKRNOS6L/FPDKR4KIKRNOS6L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTX/LKQU/IKRNOS6M/FTXLKQUIKRNOS6M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2P/XWE9/IKRNOS6X/F2PXWE9IKRNOS6X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSW/F2O7/IKRNOS77/FSWF2O7IKRNOS77.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 10: The Fret Board (part One)"}, {"step": 11, "steps_text": "A very important part of the guitar is the bridge. It acts like a sort of saddle for the strings, so that they sit neatly in the right place and do not vibrate past a certain point. This is not to be confused with the actual saddle of the guitar, which holds the ends of the strings to the body.In my guitar, because it has a longer scale length (being a baritone) I made the bridge and the saddle very close together, so they appear to be one piece. They could very well be merged, but I wanted to have a little more room to place the bridge more accurately, even if the saddle was slightly skew or off centre.Starting off with the brass tube mentioned in the 'Tools and Materials' section, I used a hammer and an anvil to flatten the ends until they made a V shape, as the pictures hopefully show clearly. After doing this to one end, I then measured and cut the tube to to correct length of 90 mm, and flattened the other. I did this very early on in my guitar's build, but for the sake of keeping this instructable flowing from component to component, I'm only talking about the bridge in this step. Hopefully that clears up any confusion about the pictures in this step being a bit widespread chronologically.Once the pipe had the correct shape, I used a dremel tool and a 1,5 mm diameter drill bit to drill six evenly spaced corresponding holes into both sides of the pipe as shown in pictures 3,4 and 5. The two thickest strings required larger holes, and I modified it as shown in picture 5.The bridge itself is just a piece of plastic 3mm thick, which I cut to the dimensions of 65 mm by 16 mm. I gave the top a slight radius, but the strings should all be in a relatively straight line when in their final positions. After using a pencil to mark the centre, I measured to the 6 points where the strings should go. The strings were all placed 9 mm apart at the bridge. I used a hand file to make a small but visible mark where each of the strings was to be placed.I then drilled six holes just below the middle of this piece, directly below each string mark. Pictures 3 and 4 show this. After that was done, I sanded the whole piece, then painted the white plastic black, because I preferred the look.Next up, I made two little parts to go between the brass pipe ends and the body so that it looked better and would not be able to wiggle. I used wood 3 mm thick, cut it to two 16x16 squares, and used the drill at an angle with a sandpaper cylinder, to shape it to fit the tapered ends of the pipe. I then painted these blocks black to make them stand out less.To finish up the saddle, I drilled holes as precisely as possible where shown in the 8th and 9th pictures. The bolts I used for these holes were random ones I had, but I think they had a diameter of 4 mm and were about 40 mm long. I drilled corresponding holes in the two black blocks and made sure everything looked neat enough when together. I then measured as precisely as I could and drilled holes into the body where the saddle had to go. I then screwed it in roughly and tested with fishing line instead of guitar strings, to see how well centred it was. Once that was done, I took it off again.Now I'll explain something that is already in the pictures but I haven't mentioned yet. Give the body a first coat of your paint of choice. It doesn't have to be perfect, since you will paint it again, but it is important to paint where the bridge is and where the pickup will go, as you won't be able to do final touch ups there neatly. If the body has any scratches on it, use sandpaper on it before painting. The back part of the body doesn't need to be painted yet. Remember, the purpose of this first painting is just to get into the areas you won't be able to reach once the pickup and bridge are installed. The body still needs to be clamped, and this will mess up the paint a bit in the clamped areas.One more thing I'll cover in this step is the nut. The nut is the second \"bridge\" located at the end of the neck, and separates the neck from the head. I cut mine from 3mm thick plastic, and cut it to 18 mm x 47 mm. I had already cut a 5mm deep gap in the neck for it to be inserted into, so that is why it is 18 mm tall. Also, I had already cut the gap in the neck to 5mm thick instead of 3mm thick, so I had to glue two 1mm thick pieces of plastic (the kind used in ice cream tubs) to the nut to get it to the correct thickness so it would fit tightly.Once it was cut and sanded to look neat, I painted it red.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZX/JLJC/IKY6HGGM/FZXJLJCIKY6HGGM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH8/SQYD/IKY6HGIP/FH8SQYDIKY6HGIP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHV/BCHY/IKY6HGLO/FHVBCHYIKY6HGLO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F64/Q11N/IKY6HGLX/F64Q11NIKY6HGLX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP3/6S3I/IKY6HGM8/FP36S3IIKY6HGM8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQC/XWAC/IKY6HGNM/FQCXWACIKY6HGNM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7H/QR2N/IKY6HGNQ/F7HQR2NIKY6HGNQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAB/R0B6/IKY6IC7E/FABR0B6IKY6IC7E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7O/DFDB/IKY6IC8I/F7ODFDBIKY6IC8I.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSK/6KT7/IKY6IC9E/FSK6KT7IKY6IC9E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FK8/MRCZ/IKY6ICEK/FK8MRCZIKY6ICEK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFE/W3C9/IKY6HGJM/FFEW3C9IKY6HGJM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPS/GTR2/IKY6HGJC/FPSGTR2IKY6HGJC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUT/ON7A/IKY6HGIY/FUTON7AIKY6HGIY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDJ/U3XK/IKY6HGIR/FDJU3XKIKY6HGIR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQO/915Q/IKY6HGIU/FQO915QIKY6HGIU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 11: Small Parts and Pre-assembly Preparation"}, {"step": 12, "steps_text": "I gave the body a second, neater coat of paint after sanding the imperfections out of the first layer.I then test-fitted everything roughly together. The neck, the body, and the fret board to make sure everything could fit neatly and without any nasty gaps. After some trimming here and there until I was happy with it, I moved onto the fret board again.I used stewmac's fret calculator again, to calculate the fret placement for my now final scale length. Here's the link again: https://www.stewmac.com/FretCalculatorOnce I placed my bridge (temporarily) in its final place and measured the distance between it and the nut, I entered that distance into the fret calculator and entered the number of frets I planned on using on my fret board. Then, from the table of values it generated, I marked each distance on my fret board.Because the fret board is tapered, these distances should be marked along a centre line, then using some kind of square, lines should be drawn at right angles to the centre line at the point where each fret will be placed.Because the fret board had already been varnished, I couldn't make a physical centre line on the fret board. So, I used tape at the ends and as long as my long T-square was kept still using the tape, I could measure all the values easily. To mark each point, I very lightly used a fineliner pen because pencil doesn't work well on varnish.Once your fret positions have all been neatly marked and there are no mistakes, you can proceed onto the next (scary) step, which is cutting grooves for your frets to be placed into. Take your time here. This step took me about an hour, if I was to make a rough guess. I first cut the slits into the marked places, using a thin serrated knife on my Leatherman multitool. These cuts were not deep or wide enough, so I resorted to using the thinnest hacksaw blade I had. It was a bit too thick for this job, but I had nothing better. Each cut was about 2,5 mm deep, and this depth followed the curved surface. I had to do this many, many times, making each cut a fraction of a millimetre deeper each time. It is VERY IMPORTANT that the cuts are straight down into the wood and that you don't hold the saw skew at all. My blade became loosened on a couple of these cuts and cut at a slight angle, which I had to correct. Later on I had to fill the corrected ones with a little more glue than the better cut ones.Once everything is satisfactory and even, it's time to place some frets into the fret board. I did so by placing the frets over their places and lightly using the bottom of a wooden hammer to tap them into place and straighten them slightly from their original curvature, so that they would fit snug against the fret board.After an hour or two of making sure every fret was level and that none were too high or low, I proceeded to the next step. To check how level they were, I placed a ruler on top of the fret board on its side and looked for any gaps between the ruler and any frets.If it wasn't flat, I either tapped a fret in a bit more, or tapped the ones surrounding it in a bit more. Eventually everything looked good enough to me to continue.I took each fret out, one by one, and glued each back down into the same place again. I then did some more corrective tapping/light hammering to make them fit properly and neatly again. This also took time, but was much faster than it would have been if I didn't do it the first time round.Once done with that. I used a dremel tool with a miniature circular angle grinder type blade and cut off the ends of the frets sticking off the fret board. I tried to cut as close to the fret board as possible without touching the wood and messing up the paint. This can also be done with strong wire clipper pliers, but I didn't have any to use.After this, I used another sandpaper cylinder (I used one on my dremel and one on my drill, each with different roughness levels of sandpaper) to bevel and round the end edges of the frets to make sure they wouldn't get in the player's way or get snagged on something and pulled out. I masked off the fret board with masking tape beforehand, to protect the paint and varnish from getting any metal filings on it, since they are hard to wipe off without just getting them squished into the paint. This took a pretty long time because of how many frets there were to trim, but it looked far better. You could also use a hand file for this step, but that would take even longer.Next, I made some fret markers on the top side of the fret board, but I didn't have any nice materials for inlays so again I used paint.

I then tested the electronics again after soldering the correct wires to the output jack. It worked fine, but I neglected to test the tone and volume knobs, and now that my guitar is glued closed and I can't access them, my volume knob doesn't work. Learn from my mistake. Mine works on full volume and can be turned off using the knob, but everywhere between fully open and fully closed results in a loud buzzing.I glued on the fret board and glued it in place, I again used white wood glue. I had to make sure I used a lot of foam rubber both on the top of the fret board and the back of the neck, so as not to scratch the neck or deform the frets with the application of clamps.I left this for about 12 hours before proceeding. When placing the fret board on the neck for gluing, I temporarily put the nut in place so that the fret board would be accurately placed. I only glued it in later though, as it needed to be attatched firmly and I had used all my clamps on the neck already.I then glued the base of the neck to the top of the body, and screwed the bridge saddle in to assist in clamping the two pieces of wood together.I then glued the bottom on very quickly, and using my four clamps and some strategically placed pieces of wood, I clamped the top and bottom of the body together and simultaneously glued the neck to both of them on the inside. I used lots of foam rubber sheet here too, to avoid messing up the paint too much or denting the surface. I left this for a day to dry. It is very important that you plan where your clamps will go beforehand, or your glue may not dry when it should. It's also important that you make sure no wires get in the way before you clamp.After the glue was dry, I used a sandpaper cylinder on the drill to trim the edges of the back face of the body, so that it was flush with the sides.When this was done, I glued the nut in place and used elastic bands and a clamp to keep it in place until the glue had set. I also inserted all the machine heads at this point. The ones I had, had one screw per head so I used a dremel tool with a 1,5mm drill bit to make the six necessary holes for screwing those into.I also screwed a screw-bolt about 45 mm long into the base of the neck at the back, with a washer on it, so that I'd be able to attatch a strap there.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F0K/B2U1/IL5G088K/F0KB2U1IL5G088K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAC/OHNX/IL5G0866/FACOHNXIL5G0866.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO2/FU8A/IL5G08AP/FO2FU8AIL5G08AP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPQ/C8JJ/IL5G08BU/FPQC8JJIL5G08BU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE0/L4JP/IL5G08E7/FE0L4JPIL5G08E7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9U/DVI3/IL5G08FH/F9UDVI3IL5G08FH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0B/XIAK/IL5G08FL/F0BXIAKIL5G08FL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU5/NVHP/IL5G08FZ/FU5NVHPIL5G08FZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEW/VH96/IL5G08G3/FEWVH96IL5G08G3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMC/R7ZV/IL5G08H9/FMCR7ZVIL5G08H9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZO/DCTZ/IL5G08JK/FZODCTZIL5G08JK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZZ/415F/IL5G08KW/FZZ415FIL5G08KW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 13: Assembly"}, {"step": 14, "steps_text": "I painted the back face of the body after some sanding to get rid of scratches in the wood. After two coats of paint, and another layer of paint on the front and sides of the guitar to patch up areas that looked different from the clamping, I varnished the whole body. I masked off the bridge, potentiometers and pickup so that they didn't get varnish on them.After a day, the varnish was dry and I was keen to hear what the guitar would sound like.I first strung it up roughly using fishing gut, because I wanted to do a final alignment check and make sure I had the grooves in the nut and bridge, in the correct places.I used a small 3-sided hand file and a thin hacksaw blade to make corrections to the grooves in the nut and the bridge, until the fishing line strings looked evenly spaced and centered on the fret board. I also cut the grooves down to the correct depth, to make for a better \"action\". The 'action' is the space between the strings and the fret board. Ideally this distance should be about 1 mm above the first fret (closest to the head) and about 2,5 mm above the 12th fret, as this is where the strings wiggle most and are most likely to strike a fret when played.One more thing I did was cut the grooves in the bridge with the saw blade at different angles, so that the strings could have a better intonation. Basically the top three and bottom three strings follow the same pattern of looking like this at the bridge end:\\======                        To head ->\\======(If that makes any sense) Otherwise just look up pictures of adjustable guitar bridges online to see the way properly set up bridges generally look on electric guitars.Once the action and string spacing seemed good (and the grooves for the thicker strings were widened) I strung it up with the real strings. There are plenty of online guides on how to string a guitar, so I won't get into details about that, but for this particular guitar the strings go in the \"front\" of the saddle and are fed all the way through until the bead eye at the end touches the saddle. Then, the string is brought over the top of the bridge as shown and fed into the correct grooves in the bridge and nut, and then to the appropriate machine head.Stick the control knobs onto the potentiometers. They should be able to stay on tightly without any glue.Once each string is in the right place, it's time to tune the guitar. Tune the strings one by one. They will stretch, so you'll have to tune it again a couple more times. Once all of this is complete, your guitar is done! Plug it in and test it out.Mine has a hollow body, so it doesn't need amplification to be a good \"anywhere\" practice instrument, but it is primarily an electric guitar and is much better when plugged in.To see the finished product, there are pictures and a video in the introductory step.

Buy a sevral different sizes and test them all out before to make sure the cut is not too big or small, once you have made the cut, it's done.Remember, do not push the router bit all the way in to the wood or you will burn the wood. It is easier to just sand rough edges than to sand away burnt wood.To route the pickup cavaties and neck slot is a bit easier. You will need to use a straight side bit. 1/8\" will work.Use a drill or drill press to hallow out the area that you are going to route so that your lines are cleaner, straighter and easier to make. (see pictures) Practice a lot before you actully route the finished product and always use templates. If you are useing a top on your bass routing can decrease the weight by 1/2 pound!You need to route the neck pocket, pickup cavities, electric cavities, and possibly under the bridge.When routing the pickup cavities, make sure that you know exactly where you want the pickup and how deep you want your pickups. The position of the pickups and distance between the strings and the pickups all deturmine the sound of your bass. Look online for standard pickup depths and positions. The electronic cavity has to be large enough that all of the pots, resisters and other electrical components. While it does not really matter where you put the electronic cavity it should be close to the pickups and 1/4\" jack so that wiring is easy enough. You also need to leave a lip so that the cover can sink into the wood slightly. Use the drill press to create holes the width of your potentiometer shafts.When you route the neck pocket make it slightly smaller than needed the first time, then come around a second time to perfect the lines. If you feel uncomfortable using the router to do the fine details, use a chisel set. When drilling the holes for the neck pocket measure many times to make sure that you are not sinking the neck too low. First make the pocket shallow then make it deeper and deeper until you like the string height/action.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F3S/Z25P/HU6RZK9L/F3SZ25PHU6RZK9L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2M/IYLN/HU6RZK9M/F2MIYLNHU6RZK9M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQK/BI56/HU4V4I9U/FQKBI56HU4V4I9U.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Drilling and Routing"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Unfortunately, this instructable is only about building the body and constructing your bass.

For a cheep j style neck check this link out:http://www.ebay.com/itm/1pcs-JP-Style-Bass-J-Bass-...For a very nice custom neck check out this link:http://www.warmoth.com/Bass/Neck/Warmoth.aspxYou may need to use a chisel to perfect the neck pocket, remember you can always make cavities bigger making them smaller is very difficult. You want the neck to fit very tight in the neck pocket so don't chisel away to much.Once your neck fits tightly in the neck pocket you want to make sure you don't need to angle the neck forward or back at all. Because this is a bolt on neck it is unlikely you will need to angle the neck however if you use a Gibson style bridge you may need to set the neck back a bit.Once you feel comfortable with he angle and feel of your neck; use the neck screws and neck plate to screw your neck And body together. You don't have to use a neck plate, I did not, however it gives it a nice look.Dont glue on the neck unless you are 105% sure you are not going to take off or replace your neck.Once you have screwed on your neck,measure where you need to place your bridge. Measure sevral times, you only get one chance at this. The average scale is 34\", however make sure that the neck you ordered is 34\" and if it not adjust where you are going to put your bridge. You can make minor adjust menus on the bridge, however measure from the nut to where the strings first make contact with the bridge.If you have not yet put on the tuning keys do that, you may also have to put on string tees/trees to keep the strings on the nut.Once you have found where to put the bridge, screw it on and string up your bass. Try playing it a little. If the action is too high up at the higher frets, then take off the bridge route wood from under the bridge. String it up again and see how it plays now. Keep doing that until the actin is perfect. Only route small amounts of wood off at a time.

Eventually, I used Solidworks to create a 3D model of the guitar body to use as a template for making it later on.

Vinegar would have been bad for the handle and I thought this would help the rust come off as I oil the mechnism. I think it helped. Electrolysis works simply only by conducting electricity from your part with rust to a scarifical piece of steel in a water with electrolytes. Here's an ecxelent instructable on the subject https://www.instructables.com/id/Electrolysis-for-...There are some dangers in the electrolysis (if done wrong) so make sure you do some research so the you understand what is happening and what sort of gases are being produced, so that you don't get poisoned, electrocuted or blow your house up.After the electrolysis I oiled the parts with WD-40 and used a wirewheel on a drill to remove the rest of the rust. It case right off after the electrolysis. I'm unsure but based on my own experience this type of \"light\" rust doesn't come off as well in the electrolysis as it does from \"ancient field find\" type of objects with really thick layer of rust. Based on my experiences, with enough time in the solution all the thick layers of rust will come off and no wirebrush is needed. This type of lighter coat of rust it seems like it's harder to get off with electrolysis.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2R/OTNJ/JOCTQ88I/F2ROTNJJOCTQ88I.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ3/SA9E/JOCTQ89L/FQ3SA9EJOCTQ89L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKH/TVZ7/JOCTQ9LP/FKHTVZ7JOCTQ9LP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR7/V5UX/JOCTQ9LO/FR7V5UXJOCTQ9LO.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Rust Removal With Electrolysis"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "The handle had a thick layer of \"something\" on top of it.

My theory is that it is due to two things: the economic downturn and the emergence of the hipster culture. CBG's are very cheap to build. And they are fun to play while sipping a Pabst and wearing an ironic T-shirt. A cigar box guitar, if you don't know, is a simple stringed instrument that uses a small wooden box as the resonance chamber. CBG's generally have 3 or 4 strings (some have 6; and some variations have only 1 or 2) and have all of the basic components of a guitar: a neck, body, nut bridge, and strings. They are often made using recycled material or found objects. This instructable will show you how to build a resonator or dobro-style CBG that is unique because it features a hidden compartment for a small bottle or flask of whiskey, some shot glasses, and a shot server. A resonator guitar is simply a guitar that has a metal vibrating surface rather than wood which creates a bright metallic sound. Resonator-style CBG's are often built using license plates or metal pet dishes. In this instructable I will use a metal hand saw as the resonator surface. Since CBG's are made using recycled materials it's unlikely that you'll start with the exact same materials that I used. So this Instructable will serve mainly as a basic guide to building your CBG rather than precise instructions.", "title": "Cigar Box Guitar With Hidden Whiskey Mini-Bar", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Cigar-Box-Guitar-with-Hidden-Whiskey-Mini-Bar/", "section": "workshop", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Some basic woodworking tools are needed. You should be able to cobble together a very nice CBG using nothing but hand tools. \u00a0But even a modest workshop will make this project exponentially easier. Don't be intimidated though. You'll be shocked at how easy (and satisfying) it is build something that makes actual music. A Wooden Cigar Box: Obviously, you'll need a cigar box. These are really easy to find. You can use eBay. You'll find really cool boxes there but you'll also spend quite a bit more than you have to especially after shipping is factored. Instead, I suggest a local cigar shop. Most shops sell empty boxes for a dollar or two and might even give them for free. Look for a box that is wood and has a thickness of at least 1.5\". The length and width can really be any dimension but bigger is better in my opinion. If you can find a box greater than 6\" x 6\" then you're golden for this project.A Metal Plate of Some Sort: An old license plate will work great. Or a hand saw. Or roof flashing. Or a street sign. Or a cookie tin. Or, I don't know, go root through the neighbor's trash.Other Materials:   Wood: Generally you'll want hardwoods.

What I'm\u00a0referring\u00a0to a \"resonator\" is any guitar that has a metallic (rather than wooden) soundboard. True resonators usually have a dome or cone shaped soundboard rather than a simple flat sheet. But for CBG's, a flat metal sheet produces a nice metallic twang. After you settle on a resonator soundboard (license plate, saw blade, etc.) trim it if needed. In my case, I cut the saw to the length of the box lid using a hacksaw and file the sharp edges smooth [side note: the metal of a hand saw is remarkably hard. I ruined a brand new hacksaw blade getting through it. Drilling holes in it was no picnic either.]\u00a0 If you\u2019re using something other than a painted piece of metal (say, a license plate) you may need to spray the surface with a clear enamel to prevent rusting.

Maple is a good choice because it is sturdy and easy to find (The \u201cbig two\u201d home improvement stores will have it in stock). Select a piece that is straight to the naked eye and free of knots. One thing to note is that, although marketed as 2\u201d it is actually 1.5\u201d.\u00a0 Cut it to roughly 48\u201d to give you plenty to work with; make sure both ends are cut square.Mapping Out the Neck: What you want to do now is make marks on the board to map out what the guitar will look like. Part of the neck will be inside the box and part will stick out one end.\u00a0 Assuming you\u2019re a normal person (i.e. right-handed) the cigar box will likely be oriented so that the hinges are on top when playing. Open up the cigar box and situate it on the bench so that the hinges are away from you and you are looking at the inside of the box. Butt one end of the maple board against the inside left edge of the box and hold it there. Mark the butt end of the board as \u201cend\u201d or \u201cbutt\u201d or however your brain will remember it. Then, on the right side of the box, trace both the inside edge of the box and outside edge of the box. In between those marks write \u201cbox\u201d to indicate the wall of the box.\u00a0 You could then write \u201cinside box\u201d to show which part of the box that will live inside and write \u201cneck\u201d on the part that will be the neck outside the box.\u00a0 I know this all seems like overkill, but it will help you avoid making a bad cut and having to start the neck over again.\u00a0 You\u2019re going to make even more notes on the board in a few steps. You\u2019ll also need to mark the wall of the box to indicate the center.\u00a0 This will allow you to center the neck board through the box squarely.\u00a0 Measure the box from inside to inside and mark the exact center.\u00a0 Then measure and mark 0.75\u201d on both sides of that center mark. This indicates the 1.5\u201d dimension of the neckboard.Reinforcing the Neck: The next thing you want to do is reinforce the neck. This is because in a little bit you\u2019re going to notch out part of the neck wood to either allow the box top to vibrate or to account for the box lid (depending on the type of box you have).\u00a0 3 guitar strings stretched over the neck and tuned create something like a 14 trillion pounds of force (may be an exaggeration). The maple board by itself can handle that. But once you start cutting away to make room for the box lid the neck can get weak pretty fast.    So to reinforce the neck, measure the distance between the butt of the maple board and the \u201cinside of the box\u201d line. Add about 1.5 inches to that measurement and cut that off the \u201coutside of the box\u201d end of the neck board.\u00a0 Cut the tip of that piece off at a 45 degree angle (for aesthetics). This will be your reinforcement piece.\u00a0 Take that piece and glue it to the underside of the neck board exactly flush with the butt end.\u00a0 Clamp it for a few hours to dry.\u00a0 The 45 degree angle will create an attractive heel where the neck exits the box.   Measure the thickness of the cigar box lid using a ruler.\u00a0 You will want to remove that much wood from the neck board from the \u201cbutt\u201d end to the \u201coutside of box\u201d mark.\u00a0 This will allow the top neck surface to be flush with the cigar box lid.\u00a0 Mark the thickness on the neck board and cut using a band saw or hammer and chisel. Test the fit and sand the new surface smooth.   Now cut a notch out of the box where the neck will poke through. To do so, trace the butt end of the neck board on the outside of the box using your previous center marks as a guide. A coping saw can be used to cut the box. Use a file or rasp to shape the hole so the neck board fits snugly.Define the Bridge Position and Headstock: Insert the neck board into the cigar box with the butt end firmly against the inside of the box. Close the lid. You could tape the lid shut to make it easier to work.\u00a0 Now it kind of looks like a guitar. Place a piece of painters tape on the box around where you\u2019d like the bridge to be.\u00a0 I usually like the bridge to be left of center but you could really put it anywhere as long as you leave at least an inch or two behind the bridge and leave room to route the strings through. Use a pencil to mark exactly where you want the bridge.\u00a0 Use a yardstick or measuring tape to measure and mark 24\u201d from the bridge. That will be the position of the nut. (Note: 24\u201d is the \u201cscale length.\u201d Besides 24\u201d there are various scale lengths that could be used.\u00a0 I like 24\u201d because it is a nice even number).   Measure about 6 inches from the nut mark on the neck board and make a cut. Then chop the resulting piece into two 6\u201d lengths and set them aside. These will be sandwiched together and used for the headstock shape.   In the meantime, remove the neck board from the cigar box and turn it over on the workbench. Use a pencil to mark the center line the entire length of the neck (e.g. outside of box part of the neck board).\u00a0 The centerline will give you a guide while shaping the neck.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FAV/GVMS/HPWY5LTH/FAVGVMSHPWY5LTH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRA/R6OM/HPWY5LXH/FRAR6OMHPWY5LXH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZY/SLYN/HPWY5LMP/FZYSLYNHPWY5LMP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7E/F7P9/HPWY5LFY/F7EF7P9HPWY5LFY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FT4/HFFX/HPWY5LJ7/FT4HFFXHPWY5LJ7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZJ/LNV3/HPWY5QV0/FZJLNV3HPWY5QV0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSJ/OMKU/HPWY5M2C/FSJOMKUHPWY5M2C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLW/DB4B/HPWY5LM7/FLWDB4BHPWY5LM7.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Map Out and Cut the Neck"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "If you have a bandsaw, use it to slowly shave the corners off of the back of the neck. You can do this by lowering the blade guide and holding the neck on an angle and using many passes to remove long slivers of wood. Keep doing this over and over until you get the rough rounded shape of a guitar neck.\u00a0 Just start at the heel and work towards the nut mark. Don\u2019t go beyond the headstock or below the heel.\u00a0 If you have no bandsaw, don\u2019t worry. You can use a hand plane or a spoke plane. It\u2019ll just take longer. And it\u2019ll help if you clamp the neck to your work bench. Use long deliberate strokes to take off slivers of wood. Once you get the rough shape, start using a rasp or 4-in-hand to continue to shape the neck. Use the center line as a guide to make sure you are maintaining symmetry and taper as you get towards the headstock and heel areas.\u00a0 Run your hand over the entire neck to locate high spots that need more attention. Your soft caress is the best caliper to getting a nice shape. Once the basic shape is obtained, start using files and rough sand paper to get it smooth.\u00a0 Then use consecutively \u00a0finer and finer sandpaper to get a nice finish.

Machine heads are used to tune the guitar by adjusting the tension of strings and, consequentially, the pitch of sound they produce. Spread some woodglue on the sides of those 6\u201d headstock pieces from Step 4. Then clamp them on the sides of the neckboard like little ears and allow the glue to dry over night.\u00a0 This creates the paddle that the headstock can be cut from. While that\u2019s drying you can design the shape of your headstock. You can do it freehand or do a Google image search for headstock designs. You can get really creative here; the only thing to remember is that the headstock will have 3 guitar tuner machine posts poke through holes. For strength, you generally want all three holes drilled through the \u201coriginal\u201d neck board and not the ears.\u00a0 This isn\u2019t gospel; it might work otherwise. But don\u2019t come crying to me if you have trouble down the road. You probably noticed at this point that the posts on the tuning machines are too short relative to the thickness of the headstock.\u00a0 If you did notice that, you\u2019re very astute.\u00a0 To correct this, you need to make the headstock thinner. Another reason to make the headstock thinner is to allow for a suitable string angle over the nut which will keep the strings from buzzing.\u00a0 Mark about 0.5\u201d thickness on the top of the headstock paddle to be removed. And taper the mark as you get closer to the nut.\u00a0 Raise the guide on the bandsaw and start cutting this away.\u00a0 An electric sander will help you get the new surface nice and smooth. Otherwise, use your 4-in-hand and sandpaper to get the surface as smooth as you can. [Note: all of this \u201cthinner headstock\u201d business and string angle nonsense could also be accomplished by using a scarf joint to angle the headstock back instead of keeping it straight and making it thinner. If you don\u2019t have power tools, the scarf joint idea might be marginally easier.] Take your awesome headstock design and trace it onto the headstock paddle and cut out with a coping saw, jig saw, or scroll saw.\u00a0 Sand the edges and feather it into the neck profile using your 4-in-hand. Mark and drill 3 holes in the headstock for the tuning machines. Depending on where you get them and the type they may or may not have a bushing for the post.

So this is just more of an idea-guide than a specific how-to. \u00a0Go to the spirits store and buy a small bottle of whiskey. \u00a0 I used J.D. since the bottle is flat and wide.\u00a0 But other brands may be better for your box size (or taste buds). \u00a0Another option would be to use a small hip flask instead. \u00a0You\u2019ll also need scraps of wood (recycle the scraps from other parts of this project), some glass shot glasses, and a few strips of twine, hemp, or leather to keep everything from jostling around while you're playing.\u00a0 Best thing would be to start this BEFORE you glue the neck board to the cigar box lid.Hide the Liquor: Dry fit the neck board into the box.\u00a0 Find a place inside the box where the liquor bottle will fit and can easily be removed.\u00a0 You might need to orient it in different ways to get it to fit. It may fit on either side of the neck; it might need to be placed behind the neck. But you want it to fit in there while still allowing the box to close.\u00a0 Use some scrap wood to build a little platform for it to sit if you have to. You may need to elevate the platform a bit using some wood braces.\u00a0 Glue these into place and clamp. If the bottle does not fit snuggly you can use some twine or leather strips to strap it into place. Drill some holes in the platform or box and tie knots in the twine to secure the bottle in place.\u00a0 Leather and twine have a bit of stretch to them so that will help to secure the bottle by stretching over the bottle like bungie cords.Create a Mini Shot Server: Measure the width and depth of the box and draw out a paddle shape on a piece of paper.

Frets are the wire pieces that go across the board width-wise. When you press the string down on a fret it shortens the length of the string and creates a higher pitch.\u00a0 Cigar box guitars can be fretted (i.e. includes fret wire) or fretless (i.e. a smooth flat surface with no wire). Fretless instruments are generally played with a slide rather than just your fingers (because it\u2019s hard to press the string down without a fret). Fretted instruments can be played with a slide or with fingers. It\u2019s much easier to make a fretless CBG so for your first build or if you are apprehensive try a fretless. If you\u2019re feeling saucy go for frets. For the fretboard, use a 0.25\u201d sheet of hardwood.\u00a0 At the \u201cbig two\u201d home improvement stores you can buy small sheets of poplar or oak that are about 4\u201d X 36\u201d.\u00a0 You can get more exotic woods like rosewood or ebony at specialty stores.Fretless Neck (easier): Cut the board to the width of the neck (1.5\u201d). For the length, measure the neck from the nut mark to the box. Add an inch or so that the fretboard overlaps the box. You could leave it flush with the box but it looks nicer if you overlap a little.\u00a0 Cut the board to length.\u00a0 Apply a thin layer of wood glue to the back of the board and to the neck and clamp the fingerboard down to the neck. Use several clamps to make sure it adheres evenly. Wipe off any excess glue with a damp rag. [A trick: to keep the board from sliding while clamping, put a few grains of salt in the glue before clamping]   You can mark the frets (to make playing a little easier) by drawing the fret marks on with a marker or a wood burner. See the \"fret template section below to figure out where to make the marks.Fretted (a little more advanced): Buckle in. Put on a pot of coffee.\u00a0 Pull up a chair.\u00a0 This is going to get tricky.\u00a0 You\u2019ll need to buy fret wire which can be purchased at a guitar shop or online.\u00a0 You\u2019ll also need some tools that you might not already have. You\u2019ll need a pull saw. You\u2019ll need a non-metal mallet. And it\u2019d be good if you have a miter box to keep the cuts straight.\u00a0 And you\u2019ll need a decent metal ruler that has metric (found at drafting or art store). Oh, and you\u2019ll need to print a template out from the internet so you know where to put the frets.\u00a0 And some super glue. Fret Template: First thing you should do is go to this link and download the template for a 24 inch scale. Then print it out. To check for accuracy, measure the template from the nut line to the 12th fret. That should be half your scale length (For a 24 inch scale that should be 12). If you get 12 then the template printed out OK. If it doesn\u2019t come out to 12\u201d then I don\u2019t know what to tell you. You probably need to fiddle with your printer settings or Adobe or something. Whatever it is it\u2019s over my head. Maybe use a different website to get the template (Google it, there are a million of them). Don\u2019t email me though. I have my own problems.\u00a0 Once you have your template printed, cut it out and tape it to the fingerboard. Use a square to transfer all of the lines to the fingerboard with a pencil.Cut Frets: Once all of the fret marks are transferred to the fingerboard load it into your miter box.\u00a0 Use the pull saw to make shallow channels at each fret mark. The cut should be deep enough to accept the fret wire but not too deep. One way of getting uniform depth is to count the saw strokes. For instance, it may take 13 pulls to get the right depth. Test this on a scrap of wood. Let the saw do the work; don\u2019t push down on the saw.\u00a0 Once you get the stroke count dialed in you can use the same number of strokes on each cut.\u00a0 Make sure each channel is evenly cut and don\u2019t lift the saw out of the cut with each pull. I highly recommend doing a test run on a scrap to get the hang of this. Once you do several cuts you\u2019ll be pretty comfortable with it.Trim the finger board: Cut the board to the width of the neck (1.5\u201d). For the length, measure the neck from the nut mark to the box. Add an inch or so that the fretboard overlaps the box. You could leave it flush with the box but it looks nicer if you overlap a little.\u00a0 Cut the board to length.\u00a0Install Frets: Cut the fret wire to length using wire cutters. The wire just needs to be slightly wider than the fingerboard (1.5\u201d). Spread some superglue into the channel (carefully) and put a piece of the wire into the channel. Now whack it into the channel with a mallet. Make sure it goes all the way in and give it a few good whacks all across the wire.\u00a0 Repeat this for all of the frets.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTI/J60A/HQ1E8UAB/FTIJ60AHQ1E8UAB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD1/EDSM/HPZLMFMN/FD1EDSMHPZLMFMN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F32/XHKL/HPZLMFND/F32XHKLHPZLMFND.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPA/379E/HPZLMFNI/FPA379EHPZLMFNI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5C/8DQC/HQ1E8TVR/F5C8DQCHQ1E8TVR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJV/JN0E/HQ1E8TVF/FJVJN0EHQ1E8TVF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRI/378X/HQ1E8TV5/FRI378XHQ1E8TV5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUW/F8B7/HQ1E8TV0/FUWF8B7HQ1E8TV0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3W/TGN5/HQ1E8TT8/F3WTGN5HQ1E8TT8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAH/AXLH/HPZLMFOW/FAHAXLHHPZLMFOW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Fretting (or Not Fretting)"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "Apply a thin layer of wood glue to the back of the board and to the neck and clamp the fingerboard down to the neck.

The nut marks one end of the vibrating length of each open string, sets the spacing of the strings across the neck, and usually holds the strings at the proper height from the fingerboard. Along with the bridge, the nut defines the vibrating lengths (scale lengths) of the open strings. You can use a lot of different hard materials for a nut. A piece of hard plastic like a hair comb would work. You could use a metal bolt. Or you could buy bone guitar nuts. Or, if you have access, you could use a deer antler.\u00a0 You could even use oven-drying modeling clay (Sculpey) or a piece of Corian.\u00a0   To create the nut, cut the hard material (I am using deer antler in this Instructable) and sand it so it is the width of the neck (1.5\u201d) and about 0.25\u201d thick.

It gives them landmarks for their brains to calibrate on as they play and glance down. As standard, these are located at the 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, and 12th positions.\u00a0 One guitars these markers can range from simple pearl dots to ornate inlayed designs.\u00a0 A very simple marker for a cigar box guitar would be a dot of paint or marker.\u00a0 Since you have your soldering iron already warmed up why not burn some dots into the surface of the fingerboard.Electronics: Cigar Box Guitars are great acoustic instruments. But you can also have fun with electronics by adding pickups and effects. Probably the simplest pickup is a piezo disk.\u00a0 Piezos are essentially buzzers that, when wired in reverse, will pickup sound rather than emit sound.\u00a0 You can buy piezos online or at Radio Shack for a dollar or two.\u00a0 While you\u2019re at it, get some wire and an input jack.

You could use a small piece of wood or metal as a decorative plate to mount the jack. The piezo can be taped or hot-glued to the underside of the cigar box lid. It will pick up vibration from the strings and amplify the CBG\u2019s sound.

I know that seems like a waste (it is). But that\u2019s just the way it is. You can use any pack of acoustic six-string guitar strings. Personally, I prefer them a little on the light side. But it\u2019s really up to you.\u00a0 The strings will come in a series of diameters which are intended for tuning as follows: E-A-D-G-B-E (Eddie Ate Dynamite Good Bye Eddie). You can use any sequence of these strings (example E-A-D or G-B-E, etc.). I like to use A-D-G and tune them to G-D-G. A note about tuning: You can tune your strings virtually to anything you want. The predominant tuning in the cigar box guitar community is 1-5-1 which means the bass (top) string is a root note, the middle string is a 5th step above the root, and the high string is an octave of the root. Strumming this essentially creates a \u201cpower chord.\u201d\u00a0 And fretting across the neck with one finger moves that chord up and down the neck. This is what makes CBG\u2019s so great for people that have never played an instrument.\u00a0 And this tuning is really great for the blues because you can play a simple 12-bar blues with almost one finger.   So after you have your strings selected and separated from the rest of the pack, open the box and thread each one up through the neck board and through the cigar box lid. Carefully guide it over the bridge and up the neck and through the little hole in the tuning peg and wrap it around the peg once manually. Keeping tension on the string with one hand, start winding the tuner with the other hand until the string has some tension on its own. Once it does, position the string in its grooves on the nut and bridge.\u00a0 Pull up on the string to give it a bit of the stretch and continue to tighten. Use a guitar tuner to get the string nearly up to pitch (there is no point in fine tuning at this point.\u00a0 Repeat with the remaining 2 strings.   Set the bridge into position by measuring 24\u201d from the nut and slide the bridge to that spot. This will get further adjustment later.\u00a0 Now tune each of the strings up to pitch.

All of the strings should be in the same plane as each other and approximately parallel with the fingerboard.\u00a0 If any are not, you can use a small file to remove more material from the grooves in the nut and/or bridge so the strings sit closer to the fingerboard.   Try fretting at the first fret. Is it comfortable? Does it take too much effort to get the strings against the fingerboard? If so, try more filing of the nut and bridge. Remember to file a little at a time and retest often. It\u2019s easier to remove material than to add material back.    You may have already noticed that while the strings are in tune while plucked \u201copen\u201d they sound a little off when fretted. This is due to the overall intonation of the instrument. To correct for this, the bridge needs to be moved to its ideal position.\u00a0 Fret one of the strings at the 12th fret and pluck while checking the tuner. If it\u2019s a little sharp, move the bridge toward the back of the guitar. If flat, move it towards the fingerboard.\u00a0 Play the string in the open position and retune. Then try the 12th fret again. You may need to go through this process a few times for each string before getting it right.\u00a0 It\u2019s OK if you can\u2019t get perfect tuning at the 12th fret. Just get it as close as possible.   This process can be frustrating because of the trial and error involved. Especially when you adjust one string only to make one of the others worse.\u00a0 But eventually you\u2019ll get it to where it sounds good.   Now try fretting each string at all of the different frets and plucking the strings. The strings should vibrate freely and not have a buzzing sound. Although you filed the frets in an earlier step it\u2019s possible that additional filing is needed. When you find a buzzing fret the culprit is usually an downstream fret that is causing the issue. For example, if the G string buzzes at 7th fret, it\u2019s probably the 8th or 9th fret that is high.\u00a0 Loosen the strings and carefully move them out of position so you can access them for filing.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F59/1ZFB/HQ477020/F591ZFBHQ477020.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F43/ZEHK/HQ477022/F43ZEHKHQ477022.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 17: Tuning, Intonation, and Final Adjustments"}, {"step": 18, "steps_text": "The great thing about cigar box guitars is the ease of playing. Any idiot can pick one up and get a tune to come out with just one finger. Most common tuning is I-V-I which basically means the low string is tuned to a root tone and the middle string is tuned to a fifth above that. The high string is tuned to an octave about the root. Since I used the A, D, and G strings from the pack I tuned to G-D-G.  Strumming this in the open position is a G chord. If you take your index finger and bar the strings at any fret it creates a different chord up and down the neck. Playing a basic blues riff is a breeze: 1) strum the strings open. 2) Use your index finger to press the middle string at the second fret and strum.  See how it sounds kind of bluesy when you co back and forth from open to pressing that one string? 3) Now press the middle string down at the third fret and throw that into the mix. Sounds really bluesy now, huh? 4) Experiment with variations of this and jam out.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ0/PDJS/HQA04FVT/FQ0PDJSHQA04FVT.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 18: Jam"}, {"step": 19, "steps_text": "Once your fingers are bloody from all that playing, pop open the lid and pour two shots. \u00a0It doesn't matter if you're alone because both shots are for you anyway.

I used 9 for the tube-part, and 2 more for the end panels. That makes 11 total : ).   Find the center of one of the squares and use a tracer to draw a 2 1/4\" circle in the middle and cut it out with a knife.   Use the 4\"x4\" with the circle cut out of it as a tracer for 8 more squares .   Align your 9 squares as straight as you can with the circles aligning and glue them together with Elmer's Glue-all or your preferred gorilla-themed adhesive. I rubber-banded these together to try to get them nice and tight   Hot glue part of an aluminum can to the inside circle of your housing now that the glue is dry.   I chose at the end of this to cover the rest of the housing with aluminum can pieces as well, as it made the housing much stronger. I hot glued them on, then I covered the corners with electrical tape because they were pretty sharp. END PANELS   Take your two remaining 4\"x4\" squares and find the center of one with a ruler and poke or drill a hole slightly wider than the rod you plan to use for your rotor.   Use your first end panel you just drilled to mark a hole on your second one in the same spot.   I again chose to cover these with aluminum can chunks.   You don't really need to, but I cut a small hole in one of my panels and hot glued in a small piece of brass tubing as an exhaust. This is just offering a path of least resistance for the air to exit, although it undoubtedly leaks out the sides a little..- You can try to glue these in place perfectly aligned with each other, but I chose just to rubber band them tightly to the ends of the tube portion of the housing.  AIR DELIVERY   Now you'll need a bit of vinal tubing and your small valve.    Drill a hole the same size as your tubing into the side of your housing. You'll want the hole to come through the side and be arranged close enough to the rotor we haven't made yet to make it spin. You may need to play with this a little bit, but when you like it, hot glue it into place.   Attach your small valve to your input tube you just glued on with more hot glue or a small hose clamp.

But there are so many vintage amps on ebay, etc., that's not always possible.Also, read some user reviews here: Harmony-central Amp ReviewsThings to look for in a vintage amp:--Does it work at all? This could be a recipe for frustration--if the transformers are bad, you could be looking at a very expensive project (of course, you might have a bargain, too.)--If you plan to rebuild yourself, simplicity is good. Are you prepared to tackle an amp with tremolo and reverb circuits, as well as a multi-stage amplifier circuit? If not, stay small.--If modding is your goal, then point-to-point wiring is best (most vintage amps are wired this fashion, anyway.) Unlike a modern PCB, point-to-point is a rats-nest approach, where the components are simply tied together with lengths of wire. This is a good thing, and actually makes noise-related problems easier to fix.Things to avoid:--Unsafe designLook for at least two transformers--every tube amplifier has an output transformer hooked to the speaker. But some old amps forgo input (power) transformers, and are wired directly (indirectly, actually, through a single cap) to the AC line voltage. This type of wiring lacks 'isolation' and is dangerous! If that one old cap fails, you're a conductor! (in the electrical, not the musical sense.) Check online schematics if you can't inspect the amp personally.The Kay 503A is a bit of a hybrid. It has an isolation transformer--but only for the amplifier circuit, not the tube \"heaters.\" This is not ideal, but it is safer than no isolation at all. With a bit of rewiring, it's not too bad. A separate power supply for the heaters would be the best option, however.

Old power supply 'filter' capacitors are the primary cause of hum. And used or not, the capacitors fail over time. Electrolytic (tubular) capacitors have an optimum life of 10 years. Of course, they may last much longer. They will often operate sub-optimally for much longer.But tube gear is sensitive to cap failure. Tubes circuits operate at higher voltages, and many amps are quite simple. Older caps with outmoded technology ('paper electrolytic') are almost certain to fail over time. In one sense, tubes are less susceptible to cap failure--unlike solid-state amps, many will continue to operate, although poorly.Cap typesMost common replacement caps are:Non-polarized (polypropylene, or mylar)Rating: 500V minimumMost builders (and rebuilders) use high quality polypropylene ('orange drop') caps. But a quality mylar cap exceeds the characteristics of the original capacitors. I wanted to retain the vintage sound, so I choose mylar. It's amateur builders, not pros, that insist a certain type of cap is a must. In any event, the difference is subtle, and the qualitative differences are a matter of personal taste.Is the difference between cap types real? Probably.Here's an interesting cap bench test.Polarized (electrolytic)Rating: depends on the amp. I used 350V caps where the originals were 150V.Regular 'computer' type electrolytic capacitors work fine. Especially for the power supply filter caps. They come in two packages: radial, with the leads on the same end, and axial, with the leads on inline on both ends.Oh, Yeah...as the name implies, polarized caps must be installed with the correct....polarity. Inserting one backwards--fireworks!Note: The first set of filter caps installed were purchased at a local electronics store. This store is nerd heaven--or so I thought. Some of their components are in yellowing packaging; clearly getting old. I picked what looked like the newest of the bunch.

The hole was pre-existing (cool!) but drilling a new one would be easy.The old 'can' was left in place for looks, and for a reference to whoever 'recaps' this amp in the future.The filter caps, originally rated at 150V, were replaced with 350V versions. Yes, you caught me--the 20 uF bypass cap is still only 160V, because that was the only one I had on hand (This is part of Mod A--I've since replaced it with a 10uF 350V cap...)When replacing the filter caps, don't exceed the capacitance values by much (I went from 40 uF spec to 47 uF.) More capacitance sounds good, right? Less hum, you say? Unfortunately, amps with tube rectifiers can't handle high capacitance values--they cause voltage spikes that wear out the rectifiers quickly. 60 - 100 uF is the recommended max for this type of rectifier...stay near the spec values here.This link has a tutorial on encapsulating (hiding) new caps inside an old cap can:http://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/~reese/electrolytics/", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5E/PPZV/F9T401PZ/F5EPPZVF9T401PZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMR/QO8H/FA0CV8KH/FMRQO8HFA0CV8KH.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Replacing the Filter 'can Capacitors'"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "Other than the filter capacitors, the other caps in the amp will be one of these (Step 8 will help you identify each of these types) :1) Coupling Caps -- connect the signal path between stages 2) Tone Caps -- roll off different frequencies to ground, for tonal effects3) Cathode-Bypass Caps -- integral part of \"cathode biased\" circuitsMost of these caps will be of the non-polarized variety. The occasional cathode bypass cap could be a polarized, however.The coupling and tone caps should have voltage ratings comfortably higher than the max voltage the circuit might see--with cap and induction spikes, just assume these should be 400 volts or greater.The bias voltage for tubes rarely exceeds 10-15 volts, however. A 50V capacitor will work fine for the cathode-bypass caps.Use a 30W soldering iron. Grasp the leads of the old caps (with needle-nose pliers, if you are smart), and apply the iron. They may take some wrestling to remove. If you can avoid cutting the lead, so much the better.Pulling vs. cutting usually leaves you a hole to insert the new replacement cap.

Compare those schematics to your amp. Having similar examples is the best way to start, especially if you are unfamiliar with tube circuitry.Note that the schematic drawing for the 12AU6 looks different--this is a pentode valve, rather than a triode, which is normally used for preamps. But the component functions are analogous.Make one change at a time. Really large changes will probably be...unsuccessful (unless you really know what you're doing, or the design was flawed to begin with.) Here are some examples:--Change coupling caps. They'll effect the tone. Smaller values will be brighter, larger values will add bass. --Adjust the \" grid leak resistor ,\" which effects the impedance and the gain of the stage. --The initial input attenuation/RC network can be adjusted (resistors directly after the jack.) --Cathode bypass caps on both the preamp and the power amp stage can be adjusted. This effects both the response and the tone (to a lesser extent.)--Changing the values of the Plate Resistor and the Cathode Resistor have a direct effect on the gain, headroom and distortion. Don't do this without a thorough understanding of the tube's characteristics, however.--Changing your speaker is another modding possibility. Be sure to match the speaker's impedance to the transformer.--Output transformers are harder to replace, unless the schematic is well documented. If it's not, look up the power amp tube data sheet and it's 'load resistance.' For instance, load resistance for the a 50L6 @ 100V is 2000 ohms, and @ 200V, 4000 ohms.

With this in mind, I decided to do what any maker would do, design and build my own guitar amp. I wanted a powerful amp that could deliver some serious volume, great sound and the possibility to bypass the preamp and plug in an external FX pedal board, or any other audio source. Guitar FX modules/pedals are usually easy to make, and thus there is a great DIY community surrounding this subject. Because of this, I decided to make the design modular so I could easily incorporate and exchange different DIY FX modules. The amp is not hard to make, but it does require some basic knowledge about electronics, and electrical safety.Ths guide will include the instructions for using the same modules I used, but it is easy to exchange these for others. For a sound sample, please watch the video (Concentrate on how the amp sounds not how I play).About the amp:At this point, I have been using this amp for some time and in many situations, and let me tell you, this thing is great. The amp features a 68 watt power amplifier and a 12\" Celestion speaker, which can deliver some serious power. The preamp section is comprised of several fx modules chained together. The modules I have currently installed are: 3 band equalizer (Tonemender), 2 channel distortion (Double D), and dual input mixer (custom design), and I left plenty of space in the top plate to add more modules in the future, like Reverb and Delay. The designs I chose for the modules were made by the guys at Runoffgroove.com, but they can be exchanged by any sort of DIY fx that you like. At the end of the preamp there is a custom dual input mixer that allows sound to either come from the FX chain or from a balanced XLR input. This way you can use the amp's FX or some external FX, or both at once. For more modules, check out DIYstompboxes.com and Runoffgroove.com (I especially recommend this website because they have sound samples so that you can easily compare and choose from their FX modules, and they often provide a breadboard layout as well). I always try to document my projects as best as I can and, when possible, make quality guides on how to make them, as I have learned a lot from the online DIY community and this is my way of retribution. This amp is desgined for guitars but, because of it's power, it works great for bass too.Recommendations and safety notes:Even though making an amp is really not too hard, it is important to note that this project involves working wit mains power and high voltages (the power amp uses 70 volts DC), so you must take safety measures and be sure that you understand what you are doing and the risks involved. For this, I recommend a series of articles by Rod Elliot (Great resource for DIY electronics enthusiasts):The Whys And Wherefores of Guitar, Bass and Keyboard Amps: http://sound.whsites.net/instamps.htmElectrocution & How To Avoid It: http://sound.whsites.net/articles/electrocution.ht...Audio Myths:  http://sound.whsites.net/articles/myths.htmlAmplifier basics:  http://sound.whsites.net/amp-basics.htmAudio Signal Mixing:  http://sound.whsites.net/articles/audio-mixing.ht...If you are really interested in understanding amplifiers and making your own, these articles will give you a very wide picture of the subject, and will help you stay safe and get an end result that satisfies you.

I picked them by price and reviews on Amazon.The AmpMounting the AMP - NOTE HERE -NOTE HERE -I picked the amp on features and reviews on Amazon - all pretty good.  What I didn't pay attention to was how it was going to be mounted in the box.  Turns out I had to remove a LED and a power switch, the board has no mounting holes on the PC board and the knobs are kinda close together.  If I would of thought this through I probably would of purchased another amp. Using the AMPSo this amp will run on a voltage anywhere from 12v to 20v.  It was listed as 12v to 18V on Amazon but I contacted the seller (Quick response from them BTW) and they told me it could run all the way up to 20v.When I first wired it up - with a spare 12v plug in the wall power supply laying around, plugged it into the amp.  I soldered the wires that came with the speakers to the board, connected and gave it a try.  It sounded like crap. It turns out the power supply would only output 1 AMP and that was way to small for the job.  I found another 12v 2Amp plug in the wall power supply and tried again - MUCH better!.  So then I tried a 20v 2.5 Amp Lenovo laptop charger and it sounded AMAZING!  I could max out the volume on the phone and on the pots on the amp and it would distort only on some heavy bass.But, then I tried to work out a battery/charger solution for a 18-20V 5Ah-ish battery solution - not so good.  With the charger and batteries it was going to be over $100.  So I decided to go with the 12V 5Ah SLA batter and charger (less than 20 bucks for both)LayoutSo I pre-fitted everything and determined where I need to drill my holes.  Measure twice, cut once you know.  I didn't want any extra holes in the box because I didn't think things through.To cut the speaker holes, I pre-drilled some 1/2 holes around the diameter then went to town with the jig-saw.  Again being careful to stay within the lines.  Same thing for the 120v plug.  For the 1\" plug for the USB and audio jack the plug required a 1\" hole saw.  I had almost every size laying around but this one.  So it was a extra $9 bucks for the hole saw.

I actually soldered the wires directly to the plug in the wall power supply and made sure to completely shrink wrap the connections same for the outputs of the 120v input.  I double sided taped the 12v battery charger to the bottom of the box.  I wanted to avoid any exposed 120v connections in the box. - The plug with the USB and audio input both had cables - the USB connected directly to the car charger and the RCA cables from the audio jack connected directly to the AMP  (this made things soooo much easier)- I used a connection block double sided taped to the top of the battery to manage all of the connections to the positive and negative to the battery. That was taped over once the wiring was complete.For the car charger, I removed the original connections on the board, replaced them with wires and then completely taped the whole charger up because it's not mounted to anything in the box.  To keep the battery from moving, I cut some thin gauge sheet steel to make a strap around the battery and another bent at 90 deg with some foam padding to keep the battery down.  All were bolted to the box.  I also added some foam padding on the bottom of the battery so that it would lay flat at the bottom of the box.  (The bottom of the box - my box anyway wasn't flat.  It had about a 1/4 raised area in the center.  I can turn the box upside down and nothing moves in it!To mount the AMP i used the three (volume, bass, treble) pots to mount it to the side of the box but this wasn't sufficient.  I also added a standoff from the side of the box with some 1/2 flat nylon washers on it and tie wrapped it to a convenient part of the PC board.

Using my Astroflight inline voltage/current/time meter and a tune with lots of drums I was able to see about two amps at a peak and around 1.7 amps with everything maxed out - volume on phone, and the three controls maxed out.  There was also some distortion with it cranked that high so the box won't see that value during actually use.So running at a 'regular' volume I'm seeing less than 1/2 an amp-ish.

I quite like writing and this thing will probably end up being really long, so I'll try to point out when you can skip stuff.)The issue is that it's easy enough to add Bluetooth to an old stereo, and you'll find a million and one tutorials telling you how, but they all rely on a spare input, or sharing one.You're really unlikely to be able to share an input with a record player though. If your amp has a phono stage built in, you don't want to be plugging anything but a record player into it (and if it has a phono stage it's probably got another input anyway), and if it doesn't have a phono stage then you'll be using a phono pre-amp, and you don't want to share an input with another amp because it'll cause interference and could damage one or both of your amps. There's also a chance of it causing damage to the sensitive electronics on the stylus, but at the very least you'll get feedback.So once I'd ruled out using splitter cables, I realised that what I was most bothered about wasn't really using one stereo, it was just not having two sets of speakers. I wondered whether I could just set up a Bluetooth amp and plug that and my other amp into the same set of speakers. When I read up on it I found that the problem there is basically the same, in that you can't have two amps joined together by their outputs, because you'll very likely end up with two dead amps. You could try being careful, and always make sure you switch one off before switching the other on, but chances are at some point you'll forget and BANG! Wrecked it.I started searching for a switching box and found a few, but they were pretty expensive for what they were. Ludicrous! So I figured I'd make one. I found this tutorial, which did what I wanted but assumed having two external amps. I only had the one, so I knew I'd need to make a Bluetooth amp as well, and I figured I might as well put the amp and switch in the same unit.As it happens, I went and put both inputs on my box anyway. Bit of future-proofing never hurt anyone. (Sarah Connor aside, obviously.)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8S/Z7EK/JMAV8QP9/F8SZ7EKJMAV8QP9.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Explanation"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "I chose the stuff I used after fairly careful consideration, so I'll give you the list but then try to explain my thinking.A DPDT switch5m 1.5mm speaker cable8 banana plugs (I used these cheap ones) - you'll need another 4 if you're not including the Bluetooth amp internally 6 pairs of speaker binding posts (cheap ones here) - you only actually need 4, unless you're future-proofing like me An amp boardA 5V buck converterA ground loop noise isolatorA couple of small lengths of 26AWG wireA USB Bluetooth 4.0 adapterA short 3.5mm to 3.5mm (jack) cable like thisAn enclosure - I used a cigar boxSo, my thoughts (you can skip this bit if you just want to get on with it)...The switch: I liked the one they used in the tutorial I linked before, so I found one similar. I'd already decided I was going to use the cigar box (because I didn't want to buy a new enclosure, and it being wood would make it easy to use) and I thought the heavy mechanical switch would look good against it.Speaker cable: Mine was from B&Q but they didn't have the 5m length on their website. If I was choosing again, I might choose something slightly thinner (or a bigger enclosure) because it was a bit of a pain to manipulate in the space, but since it's carrying the audio signal go as thick as you can manage.Banana plugs: I just went with cheap ones because the point of this whole thing was to do it cheap. They're not great, but they allow me to unplug it all without messing around threading wires through posts. You could just omit them though if you wanted.Binding posts: Cheap ones. Same reason as above. The amp I used wasn't great so I didn't really see the point in going all out on the stuff connected to it.Amp: More thought went into this. I wanted to be able to use a laptop power supply because I didn't feel confident playing with power supplies and figured using a barrel jack would be tidy and low risk.  I also wanted to be able to just plug the Bluetooth adapter in with a 3.5mm jack, in case I wanted to upgrade or plug something else in instead. So I trawled AliExpress for an amp that took a barrel jack for power and also had a 3.5mm input socket. I also didn't want something too powerful. My speakers are 90W max input so it needed to be less than that, so I went with a 50W per channel stereo board. Ideally I would have chosen a better chip (I spent a while reading about different amplifier chips) but the one I went with ticked my main boxes and was cheap, which meant if I messed it up I wouldn't have spent a load of money. (It's worth mentioning that this is my first real attempt at making anything, so I was being cautious.)Buck converter: Ten a penny really, but I went with a USB one so I could just plug it all together when I was ready.Ground loop noise isolator: You'll need one of these if you want to power the Bluetooth receiver off the amp board. When I first put it together I had two power supplies - one for the amp and one for the Bluetooth - which is too much when you've got other stuff plugged in too. If your output and input share a power supply though, you'll get a load of horrible hissing and popping noise, but one of these little things filters the signal to remove that. I also bought another one to put in my car because I use a Bluetooth receiver in there and can hear all the electric noise my turbo and indicators produce otherwise.Wire: Wire's wire. Or is it? 26AWG is easy to work with and I bought a bundle of little lengths because I figured they'd be handy for other stuff.Bluetooth adapter: I wanted one that would be always on, so I didn't have to listen to it talk to me whenever I connected. I also wanted Bluetooth 4.0 to get the best sound I could for my money. Actually, it took a while to find the right one, but the one I got worked a treat. The only issue with it really is that it has a bright flashing green light on it, but once it's inside the box you can't see that so it doesn't matter.Enclosure: I really wanted to use a sleek aluminium case, or order a 3D printed one, but it was going to more than double the cost, so in the end I found a cigar box in the garage and went with that. I think it was a great choice actually. It was easy to work with, looks pretty cool, and if I'd messed it up it wouldn't have cost me anything.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F1H/VA1K/JMAV8OY3/F1HVA1KJMAV8OY3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Parts"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "I used:A drill with various sized wood-boring bits (10mm, 7mm, 6mm and 2mm, though that all depends on the exact parts you use) A rotary tool with a small sanding bit (which I'd only just bought and I made a bit of a mess, but it was on the back so it's not the end of the world) A soldering iron Solder Wire clippers/strippers A pair of long-nose pliers A small adjustable spanner A ruler A pencil A small flat-head screwdriverYou might want to use a helping hand for the soldering", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FVW/TTOH/JMAVD2BR/FVWTTOHJMAVD2BR.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Tools"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Once I'd got all my parts, and found the cigar box, I had to figure out how best to lay it all out.

That was basically to avoid tipping the whole thing up every time I switched it over. The switch is fairly stiff so I thought if I put it on the front it'd be awkward, and if I put it towards the front or back on top I'd risk tipping it over.I put the amp at the front so that the volume dial and power LED would be visible and accessible. It could have gone in the lid with the dial and light on top, which might have made it a little easier to get to the stuff inside, but stereo stuff normally has the volume dial on the front, so on the front it went.The binding posts (inputs and outputs) needed to go on the back to keep them out the way.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F71/TE95/JMAV8OTR/F71TE95JMAV8OTR.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Decide on a Lay-out"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "On the back, I figured I'd put the outputs at the top and the inputs at the bottom. If you look at the first picture on this step you'll see how I laid them out. I measured the width of the posts and the distance between the two on each set and drilled holes for them all, measuring out and marking where they'd go beforehand. The mistake I made was in putting them too close to the bottom of the box, which made screwing them together inside a right pain.The laptop charger had a chunky bit that would need a decent-sized hole to get it through the back of the box, and I didn't have a drill bit big enough, so I drilled a 10mm hole and then used the rotary tool to widen it. I didn't have a small enough sanding bit so used a sharpening bit instead and basically burnt the wood away until the hole was big enough. What a mess! But I only have limited tools, so I had to improvise. (Plus, as I said, this was on the back so I wasn't too worried.) It would have been neater just to use a needle file but I didn't have long to do all this while the little'un was napping inside, so I was in a rush.On  the top, I used my ruler from corner to corner in both directions to mark a small diagonal cross in the middle of the top of the box. I then measured the diameter of the screw thread on the top of the switch and drilled a hole where my cross was. Luckily it was 10mm, which meant I had a drill bit big enough and wouldn't need to widen it. (We know how that went last time.)I measured across the front of the box for the volume dial and marked a spot that would mean the amp would be about a centimeter from the bottom of the box inside (knowing the nut holding the volume dial in would hold it steady) so air could circulate. (I don't imagine it'll get particularly warm, but better safe than sorry.) I measured the distance from the centre of the dial to the centre of the LED and marked a spot to drill for the LED.I realised just before drilling that the post for the volume dial wouldn't reach all the way through, so I measured the width of the nut that holds it on as well. I drilled into the front of the box first, but not all the way through. Then I drilled within that indent a hole the width of the post. That meant the post would go through, and the nut would tighten and be flush with the outside of the box. Hopefully you can see what I mean from the second picture. I then drilled the LED hole.(Check out my great drawing if you need any extra help understanding any of this.

Cut some appropriate lengths of speaker wire for the internal connections. I needed two lengths to connect the amp to the switch, two to connect the external input to the switch (remember there're two inputs, but I'm only using one), and two to connect the switch to the outputs. So six in total, and I cut them to about 12cm each.2. Speaker cable is dual wire, so before stripping some outer plastic off you'll need to split the two wires down the middle, enough to allow you to work with it. I found that about 4cm down each end worked.3. Then strip about 15mm of the plastic outer sheath away from each wire on each end, so that's four wires stripped per length of cable. Twist up the ends so they're tidy. Stray strands of wire in here could result in ruined amplifiers, so make sure there're no strands floating about.4. The two lengths that you're going to connect to the amp need to stay straight on one end, but on the other end of those, and on both ends of every other piece, bend the wire over a thin screwdriver to give you an open hooked shape on the exposed wire, like a shepherds crook.5. Soldering time. You're going to cover the curved wire ends in solder. This will help you connect it all up (because the nuts on the switch and the binding posts will grip the single soldered chunk of wire better than a load of twisted strands) and it'll stop stray strands, which could cause shorts. Hold your soldering iron out and basically drape the hook over the top of it so the tip is heating the wire. Hold the solder on the top of the wire (so the wire's between the tip of the iron and the solder) and when the wire is hot enough it'll act like a wick and suck the solder into it as it melts it. You don't need loads; just enough so you can see it in and on the cable. (Careful not to melt the plastic sheath further down.)That's the wires ready. You should have six lengths of cable (each consisting of two wires) with all of the ends exposed, two of which will be straight on one end and hooked on the other, and the other four will all be hooked on both ends.(Later you'll need cables to connect your stereo to the box and the box to your speakers, but you'll have two of those already, currently connecting your stereo to the speakers, and you should have plenty of cable left over to make the other two with.)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FUR/4X26/JMAVD2CK/FUR4X26JMAVD2CK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Preparing the Cables"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Now to start putting it together.

(It's worth reading through that whole article as well. It's good and might further help to explain what we're making.)I chose to have the top row of the switch as my Bluetooth amp (so I used the cables with one hooked and one straight end here) and the bottom row as the connection to my stereo, so that when I turned it over and set the switch into the lid of the box, what was the top when I was looking at the underside of the switch would become the front row in the box when the lid was closed. That way the wires weren't all going to be crossed over each other.You're going to hook your hooked and soldered wires round each peg and tighten the nut onto them. It'll be a bit fiddly, but the soldering you did will make sure you don't squash the cable and end up with strands splayed out of the sides.Once you've done that, you can slot your switch up through the hole in the lid (from the inside, so the switch is protruding out the top) and fasten it with the nut if you want, though it's probably easier to leave it till you've connected the wires to the rest of it inside.(One thing to note here, is that I decided on the binding posts at the back being right and left when looked at from the front, so that my right-hand speaker would be connected to the output on the right from the front and wouldn't be crossed over.

It doesn't really matter which two, since the other two are unused anyway. Again, pay attention to your rights and lefts.(Right is red, by the way. Rs go together.

You need to go positive to positive, and negative to negative.My amp board's power input, like most barrel connections, has the positive on the pin/tip and the negative on the sleeve. The jack (where the power plugs in) has three pins that are soldered to the board and protrude from the underside. The one at the side detects if there's a plug plugged in so you can ignore that. The one at the back is for the tip (so will be positive) and the one at the front (nearer the edge) is for the sleeve (so will be negative).(This Sparkfun page has some info about barrel connectors if you want a visual of that.)Solder your two wires to these pins on the underside of the board.

This instructable does not show how to make a cabinet, but I'll save that instructable for a later day.  Make sure to vote for me in the Amp and Circuits contests.  Good luck building!Disclaimer:  This project deals with potentially lethal  high voltage, build at your own risk.Edit: I have been getting many complaints in the comments section regarding the safety of this amp section.  I fully agree, this amp does pose a safety hazard to people without an adequate knowledge of electronics.  These complaints also focus on poor design of the power supply section.  The power supply does not contain a power transformer because I did not have one readily on hand.  Same with the tube sockets.  I built this out of the supplies that I had available.  In addition, this amp will eventually be placed in a cabinet.

There are of course other brands that sell replacement batteries, but these usually carry a lot less charge, and aren't much cheaper. These are even more of a scam than the batteries sold by the original manufacturer.Okay, so are you ready to give it a try?", "title": "Extending the Life of a Cordless Drill (by Adding a Cord)", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Extending-the-Life-of-a-Cordless-Drill-by-Adding-a/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "For this project, I assume you are at least familiar enough with electricity to know that simply plugging the drill in to the mains power of your house isn't going to work, and that you have soldered before. I will give an alternative method if you don't feel comfortable with a soldering iron, but if you have access to one, I recommend using it.The tools and materials required for this project:Old battery from your drill  Soldering iron & tin wire (or a few terminal blocks if you don't feel comfortable soldering)  Wire strippers (if you don't have one, you can also use a pair of scissors or your teeth)  Two short lengths of heat shrink tubing (can also be replaced by two short lengths of electrical tape if no heat shrink tubing can be found)  Screwdrivers  Multimeter  12v power adapter**Finding the right power adapter can be hard. It needs to be 12V DC with around 10 Amps.Unfortunately, not all power adapters list the same specs in the same way on the same place.First, you need to look at the OUTPUT voltage, not at the input.The voltage is usually a number between 3 and 24 followed by a capital V.(you need to find one with 12V)Second, determine that the adapter is DC, and not AC.AC voltage is very different from DC voltage, and will most likely break your drill, so pay attention. AC is marked simply \"AC\" ore more commonly with a little wave ( ~ ). DC is either marked DC or with a line with three dots under it ( \u2393 )Third, and probably hardest, find an adapter with enough amps to support your drill. Depending on the speed of your drill, you wil need an adapter with around 10 amps. Fore some slower drills 5 amps could be enough, but if you have to go out and buy an adapter, I recommend going with 10 amps to be safe. the amount of amps is either given by a number between 100 and 900 followed by mA (milliamps) or simply a number between 1 and 999 followed by a capital A.100 mA is equal to 0.1APlease note:I am no expert, and although I have tried to explain this as simply and clearly as possible so that anyone can follow this guide, I take no responsibility if you break your drill following this guide, or electrocute yourself.

Don't cut of the loose strands of copper or silver, this is part of the wire, not part of the insulation.

Set the multimeter to measure DC voltage, and plug the adapter in (make sure that the wires from the adapter aren't touching each other, this will short out the adapter)If the multimeter is reading 12V, the red wire is connected to the positive of the power adapter, and the black wire from the multimeter is hooked up to the negative (mark the wires on from the power adapter)If the multimeter is reading -12V, the black wire is hooked up to the positive and the red wire to the negative.(mark the wires on from the power adapter)If the multimeter is reading nothing, it's either not set to the right setting, not making a good connection with the power adapter, or the power adapter isn't working properly.Now that we know what wire we need, it's time so solder!Add a bit of tin to the end of both exposed wired from the power adapter and from the battery connector for the drill, and slide a piece of heat shrink over the wires from the power adapter.Solder the positive wire from the power adapter to the red wire from the plug of the drill.Solder the negative wire from the power adapter to the black wire from the plug of the drill.Slide the two pieces of heat shrink over the soldered joints, and heat them until they properly insulate the wires.The solder-free alternative:If you don't feel comfortable using a soldering iron, use the same method described above to determine the positive and negative wires from the power adapter, and connect the positive wire to the red wire from the plug of the drill using a terminal block.

In addition, I play lefty.

For the front of the guitar body, I was most interested in having cool texture that really put the weathered look of the wood on display. For the board I purchased, there was a distinct and interesting whorl on one end of the board that I liked -- it is the inclusion from where a branch had emerged from the original tree. For this feature to show up on the guitar:it had to be on the wide part of the body (away from the neck) to avoid being under the pickguard it had to be on the outer edge (to avoid being under the bridge that anchors the strings)This defined how I had to cut a piece around the whorl, and how big the piece needed to be, which I determined by holding my cardboard template up to the piece.The whorl was on the outside edge, so the opposing edge was the one that would need glued. If the grain of the wood had been angled in some way I would have paid careful attention to the matching so there was a pleasing pattern at the glue joint (this is similar to \"book-matching\", where a symmetric pattern is created across a glue joint). The grain was relatively straight, so I found another piece of the board that also had straight grain and would match on easily with little or no indication of a joint.The board near the whorl was split badly, so I squared it off with my table saw, and also squared the end off. Additionally, I sawed down the edges that would be glued, to make a nice interface for the glue to bind on. I put a thick bead of wood glue and clamped the panel together overnight.

The barnwood face and backbody wood together were 1-7/8\" thick, about 1/4\" thicker than the standard telecaster thickness.I planed a bit off both pieces using my router sled. Planing like this was not a perfect process, leaving small running ridges between passes. The pattern left behind was easy to sand out with my palm sander.

I didn't want any extraneous holes, so I put brads through the location of several screw holes, and used a piece of scrap wood as a clamp, screwed down in the location where the body cavities would be. I had this center clamp because the face of the barnwood was not flush everywhere against the template, and I didn't want it to wander.To router out the shape, I used two flush trim bits. The first has the bearing high on the shank (near the collet of the router). The bearing butts up against the MDF template, and the router bit chews away at the wood, making a match to the template.  You can see in the photos the bit was not the full depth of the body, and there was a \"shelf\" left below the end of the bit.At this stage, I flip the piece over, and use a flush trim bit that has the bearing on the bottom of the bit.

I then laid the template under the MDF template, and transferred the shape of the opening for the neck pickup.I could have used a pair of tin snips and a Dremel to cut the license plate out, but I have a new xCarve I'm learning to use, so I decided to let it cut the pickguard out. I scanned my template into the computer, and converted the outline to an SVG file that defined the cuts the xCarve had to make.The cut left small tabs at various locations, which I used my Dremel to cut through, giving my final pickguard.

This was the first guitar I've ever built, so there are a whole host of these small things. I'm a big fan of noting these tribulations, because it reminds me not to do them again! If I put them here in the Instructable, maybe it will help you be aware of things that can happen.Recovering from these sorts of foibles is a creative process and necessary skill. In the end, each little oddity is part of the whole host of things that make this guitar uniquely mine. :-)Here are a few of the things that  happened:(A) I've gotten very used to using my router table to do edge work, which gives me a lot of control over the piece as I'm shaping edges. For the guitar I had decided I couldn't always get the body where I needed it to be as I walked around the template, so I used my hand-held router. At one point as I was lifting the router away from the edge of the guitar body and template, it caught the edge and dug a deep gouge into both the template and the front edge of the guitar. The template is ruined, and there was a nice divot on the bottom of the body. I filled it with red oak wood putty and then shaped it over. I don't think it is too noticeable, but I see it there. :-P(B) The classic telecaster shape is pretty boxy on the edges, but I wanted to have smoother contours around the body, to highlight both the aged wood as well as the preserved original wood underneath, so I took a 1/2\" roundover bit on my router and walked it around the front and the back of the guitar.  I think it looks AWESOME, but there was an unintended consequence. The neck on a telecaster sits in a pocket in the body and is secured with screws that come from the back of the body and into the neck. The attachment screws bear down on a steel plate to give the connection plenty of strength. With such a strong roundover, the edges of the neck plate are hanging out slightly in open space, rather than sitting firmly on the wood of the body. It doesn't affect the guitar's performance at all, but you can see the little hangover if you look closely. The solution is to use a smaller roundover, at least in this area of the guitar.(C) As noted above, I carved my pickgaurd out of a license plate using my xCarve. This was one of my earliest experiences with the xCarve, so I'm still on a learning curve. In this case, I had not appreciated that I could set the router to carve so that it carved on the center of my template line, or on the inside or outside. I templated the exact shape and location for the neck pickup, that sticks up through the pickguard, but I carved with the router bit on the centerline, which means the pickup hole is a bit wider than expected. In principle this doesn't matter, but if you look closely you can see down into the guts of the guitar.  I didn't have an extra license plate, so instead of making a new pickguard I cut a small insert out of a piece of black foam that hugs the pickup, but sits under the pickguard so it looks black in the gap.(D) Lastly, I made a mistake I really shouldn't have made. I drilled pilot holes for all the screws in the guitar, but for the pilot holes on the bridge the first set I drilled was undersized, and I twisted a screwhead off as I was putting it in! Arghhh! The screw diameters are small enough I don't see how I can use a screw extractor to get the screw out without damaging the guitar, so I opted to leave it broken off. There isn't an option of putting another screw in because the bridge is hard steel. There are 4 screws across the bridge, and if I had broken off one in the middle it would have been hidden under the strings. This one is on the outside edge, so if you look you'll see it looks like my guitar is missing a screw!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWT/69FD/JEST43ID/FWT69FDJEST43ID.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIQ/PJ0F/JEST43IF/FIQPJ0FJEST43IF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU1/MWVS/JEST43IC/FU1MWVSJEST43IC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS3/UJLL/JEST43IE/FS3UJLLJEST43IE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP7/X0SH/JEST57BF/FP7X0SHJEST57BF.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 21: Little Mistakes & Tribulations"}, {"step": 22, "steps_text": "This was a great project to work on, and the final guitar plays great.

Technically an electric guitar can be any shape you want, but some shapes are definitely more comfortable than others. A popular production guitar is often a good starting point.Neck1. The scale length determines how tight the strings will be. It is the length of the open string (from nut to when it breaks on the saddle). A longer scale length will make strings tighter. Fender guitars generally have a 25.5\" scale length, and Gibsons often have 24.75\". These two lengths are good starting points. Note that the scale length is NOT the length of the neck!2. The width at the nut is often the metric for how wide the neck is. For 6 string guitars, typical values are between 41-44.5 mm. 43mm is often considered the standard. More strings will need a wider nut width. Typical values can be found from guitar specifications.3. The thickness and shape, or profile, of the neck is very important to the comfort of the guitar. Generally necks are a symmetric oval shape. The thickness is often 19-25mm, measured at the first fret. Asymmetrical necks are becoming more common, where the neck is thicker on one side than the other, which may be more ergonomic.Bridge and PickupsDetermine what kind of bridge you want for the guitar. Will it be headless? Will it have a tremolo (whammy bar)? Or maybe both, you monster :PThe pickups in a guitar are probably the biggest influence to the sound. Here is an awesome, very detailed, set of FAQs by Seymour Duncan about pickups that have just about everything you need to know.Material Guitars are generally made from hardwood.The fretboard should be a very dense, hard wood. Rosewood and maple are common choices, but there are many alternatives. An oily wood, such as rosewood, will not need to be finished.The neck should also be a fairly sturdy hard wood. Again, maple is often used, and mahogany.The body can be made of a softer wood, but a better quality wood will likely sound better. A wood that is too hard and dense will make a guitar very heavy. Common choices are mahogany, ash, alder, and basswood.Read this for more about tonewoods.My Specifications (and kind of BOM)7 strings25\"-26\" multiscale <- for more information about fanned frets/multiscale26 frets (as a result of the multiscale - leftover frets)46mm neck width23.5mm thick, asymmetrical neck profileBlack limba bodyMaple, padauk, sapele laminate neck Pau ferro fretboardHeadless tuners and bridge from Mera GuitarsFloyd Rose locking nut and stainless steel zero fretHand wound pickups with custom preamplifierGold Evo fretwire from LMII (FW55090)Truss rod from StewMacBlack misc hardware (strap buttons, knobs, screws, springs, foam tape etc.) from eyparts", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 2: Specifications"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "The neck and fretboard are the most important factors in the comfort and intonation of a guitar. The parameters of the fretboard (distance between frets, width, length...) need to be perfectly calculated and designed in order to achieve a professional quality guitar. Luckily, a tool called FretFind2D makes the process of modelling a fretboard quite a bit easier.The scale lengths portion is quite self explanatory. The values for string width at nut and at bridge can often be found in the specifications of the nut/bridge if you are buying one. Alternatively, multiply the bridge string spacing (often 10.5mm or 10.8mm) by the number of spaces between the string (5 for 6 strings, 6 for 7 strings) to find the E-e distance. The fretboard overhang value should be at least 2mm to prevent the outer strings from falling off the fretboard. I like to have 3mm-4mm for some extra space.This model is then exported to a DXF to create the 3D model in your CAD program, or you can use the PDF to create a plan for sawing the fret slots.", "step_imgs": ["/assets/img/pixel.png"], "step_title": "Step 3: Mapping Out the Fretboard"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "While CAD is absolutely necessary in a CNC build, it can also be helpful for more traditional router-and-template builds for creating detailed and accurate plans.Beginning by establishing a centerline, a series of drawings are made, with the imported DXF from FretFind, the body shape, and the headstock shape (or whatever is left of it). Splines are used for the body. The neck shape also determines the neck pocket shape. Note the radii on the corners of the heel, which are required for a router bit to create the neck pocket. In order to create more contact surface between the neck and the pocket, I extended the shape of the neck. This also resulted in space for 2 extra frets! Woo!The two blue lines show the 2 locations that neck profiles will be drawn to create the shape of the neck.The blue line here reflects the profile at the first fret, the orange one is the one at the 17th. Note the asymmetrical profile at the first fret, which will, along the length of the neck, transition into a symmetrical profile. This makes the neck feel thicker and more comfortable at the top, yet thinner and faster near the bottom.Fretboards tend to be 6.35mm (0.25in) thick. To achieve my target 23.5mm thickness, the profiles should be 17.15mm at the maximum. The headstock and region where the neck meets the body should be 25.4mm (1in) thick, meaning all of these surfaces should be a thickness of 19.05mm (0.75in).The difficult about modelling a guitar neck is the organic surfaces that make up the back. The part that the neck meets the headstock is quite annoying to model. However, it can be broken down into a lofted surface between the first fret profile and the profile outlined by the grey surface. The neck outline and the third line near the top serve as boundary/guide curves for the loft.After the loft is created, there may be sections of surface that extends OUTSIDE of the boundary set by the neck shape. However, this extra surface will cause issues in the CNC when it will try to carve a surface that is vertically concave - it will not like that. Therefore, the extra surface is intersected with the two extruded parts of the neck shape to create a surface that is no more than 90 degrees.The carved surface at the heel of the neck is created using the same process, but with these curves shown.The back surface of the neck is created using a loft between the two profiles, and the neck outline as a guide. These surfaces are joined and a solid created by filling in all the other surfaces required for the neckThe front surface of the neck receives an extruded cut for the truss rod. Dimensions will vary with different truss rods. Here I am using the dimensions from a StewMac Hot Rod.

Using these drawings, the outline of the fretboard, leaving a bit of an overhang for the zeroth fret, is extruded into a 6.35mm (0.25in) solid.Fretboards have a certain radius on the surface, and values from 7-20 inches are commonly seen. This is easily created using a CNC. The center of that arc is located one radius away the top of the fretboard. This arc, when used to slice the solid, creates our radiused fretboard.I am going to be embedding optic fibers inside my fretboard to make glowing side fret markers.

This makes it really easy to model once the shapes are all created. More drawings are made on the body for all the cavities.The small rectangular cutout near the neck is used for the LED for the side lights. The cutout for the bridge is also created at the far left. I created a custom bridge mounting plate (again, models included), but Mera Guitars does offer pre-made bridge plates. However, they will not fit in this route and you will need to change the cutout. I will attach a model with only the control cavity cut out for those who are interested in using different pickups/bridge/no LED.Mounting holes for the neck and pots/switch are also created.The extruded cut of the neck pocket is shown here. The depth that the neck sits in the body is 19.05mm (0.75in). This is a fairly standard depth based off of Fender dimensions.Pickup cavities should accommodate most of the thickness of a pickup, leaving no more than 2-3mm above the top of the body when bottomed out. Mine are a good standard of 19.05mm. The cutouts for the pickup legs (short legs) are a full 25.4mm (1in). The cavities should leave about 1-2mm around the pickup.The control cavity and LED cavity are, of course, extruded from the bottom. The offset shapes around the cavities create ridges for mounting the covers.While designing cavities on the guitar body, make sure to think about how they will be executed. Walls that are too thin may break on a CNC. Corners of cavities will have a radius because an end mill/router bit is round. Some cavities are deep and can only be cut using a larger, longer bit. These factors should be considered when designing.Arm and belly carves can be created using surfaces extruded along a line. Here I show the process of creating the arm carve.

Here I have more than 6mm of material between any hole and the edge.A small cutout, created with reference to the slot on the back of the fretboard, is used for routing the optic fibers out of the neck. Two shallow 1/4 inch drill points are marked (and mirrored on the fretboard) so that dowel pins can be used to invisibly align the neck and fretboard when gluing.The corresponding clearance holes on the body are created.

The body wood should be 2\" thick to start as lots of planing will need to happen for a square stock. Don't be afraid to use multiple smaller pieces of wood and glue them together, although professionals say that fewer pieces sound better! The neck wood should be at least 1\" thick - I try for 1.5\" just for safety. Note that the neck certainly needs to be quite straight. The fretboard generally starts as a 1\" thick pieces which is resawn to two 1/2\" thick pieces. (In cold cold Canada wood is sold in inches...sorry for the confusion eh)A lot of the time spent on a CNC is setup and tool changes. I tried to minimize this by running as many operations as I could in a single run. I started by preparing the body/neck wood by:1. Using a joiner to square up two faces of the raw lumber2. On a planer, square up all edges (make sure there is extra material for final planing after gluing!)3. Glue together all pieces of laminate4.

The magnets pull the saw against the block, forming a stable, adjustable, yet simple saw guide. The top of my block also acts as a depth gauge.

The screw is loosely clamped in the drill press so it can still turn, but does not fall out.The neck is bolted to the table. The drill chuck will hold the insert much more perpendicular than a screw driver. While gently pushing down with the drill press, a hex wrench is used to turn the top two nuts, which will turn the threaded insert, so that it drives into the wood. I used a bit of wax to help it cut.While on the drill press you can drill the mounting holes for the locking nut (I did this later), with a piece of carpet tape to hold it in place while marking the hole locations. I also drill the exit hole (shown) for the optic fibers.Using carpet tape, I attached the fretboard to the neck as accurately as possible.

Keep the drill bits in while gluing so that the halves do not slide.After gluing, the frets are sanded down flush against the side of the fretboard. Machining marks are removed from the neck using progressively finer sandpaper grits, up to 600.I used 4 coats of satin Wipe On Polyurethane from Minwax to finish the neck.

In the picture you can see a Sharpie'd fret, some flat frets, and some frets that I have crowned, leaving a faint line of Sharpie in the middle.

It runs of a rechargable 9 volt battery, which provides about an hour of full volume play per charge. At two watts, the milli-AMP is more powerful than any commercially available amp (that I know of) of its size; its size being a very pocketable 2.25 by 3.5 by 1 inches (roughly). Volume is controlled by the volume pot on the guitar, and this adversly controls distortion as well.

One thing that might be a good idea is to build each amplifier with its own independant circuit, i.e. each amp has its own seperate connection to ground, positive battery supply, input, etc. The purpose of this is to allow a blown amplifier chip (no that that should happen) to be removed and replaced without disturbing the other chip. Also, pay special attention to the polarity of the charging jack. The center pin should be positive, with the sleeve contact being negative.\nAs for the enclosure itself, a hole has to be drilled in one side for the enclosure for the input jack, then two holes on the opposite side for the switch and charging jack. If you want to add a clip to the back (optional) drill that hole now as well. Two holes, each 1/4\" in diameter, should be drilled on the narrow end of the enclosure near the speaker, as well as two other holes opposite eachother on the sides adjacent to the previously mentioned side. These act purely as ports for the speaker. As for the speaker itself, it was placed face down on the top of the enclosre, and a knife used to score a circle around the edge. A 1 inch spade bit was used to drill out the middle of this circle, then a dremel with a sanding drum used to enlarge the hole so the speaker would fit comfortably. Unfortunately, the speaker does not have any mounting hardware, so it has to be glued in place.\u00a0\nOnce the circuit is built, it has to be placed in the enclosure. The battery goes at one end, with the two jacks next to the battery opposite eachother, and the switch and amplifier circuit mounted underneath the speaker. See the pictures of the layout.\nSince the speaker has a relatively shallow mounting depth, there is even enough room for two small heatsinks to be placed on top of the amplifier chips. The heatsinks are just cut up pieces of a regular heatsink filed down to fit. They were then glued to the amplifying chips using a homemade \"thermal glue\" of JB Weld mixed with aluminum shavings. I know its not ideal, but its better than not having any heatsinking at all.\u00a0\n(Note: Ignore the grill cloth shown on the amp.

What it allows you to do is use 4 digital pins, to control the flow of 1 to 16 other pins. And is bi-directional, meaning it can be used to read senors, or used to send data.A good tutorial on these can be found here: http://bildr.org/2011/02/cd74hc4067-arduino/But here is the basics of it, the 4 digital pins are used to connect one of the other 16 pins to the SIG (or SIGNAL) pin.  The SIG pin can be connected to any I/O pin on the microcontroller, this includes the serial pins (RX, TX), I2C PINS (SDA, SCL) or any other digital or analog pin.  The 16 I/O pins are marked C0 to C15, and are switched on/off using a binary sequence on the S0 - S3 pins.The binary sequence is really the number of the PIN you want to connect to.If you look at the chart above you'll see how with 4 bits you can make the number 15.  IE:0000 binary does equal 0 in decimal. and 0001 binary does equal 1 in decimal.2 in decimal would be 0010 in binary (notice you need all four bits as either a zero or a one) The one is in the two place holder so it's 0010 binary is 2 decimal.0101 binary would be 5 decimal (Why? there are zero 8s, one 4, zero 2s, one 1 = 4+1 = 5 decimal)So for the mux it goes like this:The order is S3, S2, S1, S0 - 0 represent a LOW and 1 represent a HIGH.\n\n0000 Connects to C0\n0001 Connects to C1\n0010 Connects to C2\n0011 Connects to C3\n0100 Connects to C4\n0101 Connects to C5\n0110 Connects to C6\n0111 Connects to C7\n1000 Connects to C8\n1001 Connects to C9\n1010 Connects to C10\n1011 Connects to C11\n1100 Connects to C12\n1101 Connects to C13\n1110 Connects to C14\n1111 Connects to C15\nThis is easy to do with a micro-controller, a zero would be a low on a pin, and a one would be a high on that pin.*The website I refereed to has the S pins listed in the opposite direct, the way \"we\" would count from S0 to S3 - while, it is saying the same thing, the binary looks out of place and also opposite the way it should look.  If you look at the MUX board reading it from left to right the pins are labeled S3, S2, S1, S0 - meaning S0 is the least significant bit *As you can see, these MUX boards can only have one pin Connected to the SIG pin at a time, but they can be switched very quickly. For this project, these boards are a little more than what we need, and honestly it does seem strange to use 6 pins up when the sensors technology only need two pins.  So lets look at that - the MUX boards are capable for doing 16 pins, so 5 pins to 16 is a pretty good trade off - giving you 11 additional pins to play with. My sensors do not have a easy way (that I know of) to set a different I2C address, so both sensors are on the same address, and we all know that will cause problems. So this seemed like a good solution.  And is pretty easy to use and setup.Next let's look at the L9110 motor driver.....", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F90/N87Y/IVO3M26J/F90N87YIVO3M26J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSF/2HCG/IVMQ57YV/FSF2HCGIVMQ57YV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXC/YO5O/IVMQ57YW/FXCYO5OIVMQ57YW.LARGE.gif"], "step_title": "Step 5: Understanding the Operation of the MUX Board."}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Banana Robotics has a great tutorial on using this device. https://www.bananarobotics.com/shop/How-to-use-the...These work a little different then my L298 motor drivers. So forget what you know about them (at least just for a minute).The HG7881 (L9110) is a compact motor driver chip that supports a voltage range from 2.5-12V at 800mA of continuous current. These chips have built-in output clamp diodes to protect your sensitive microcontroller electronics. They are suitable for very small robot projects.Each HG7881 (L9110) chip is able to drive a single DC motor using two digital control inputs. One input is used to select the motor direction while the other is used to control the motor speedIf IA is Low and IB is LOW - The output to the motor will be LOW, if IA is HIGH and IB is LOW the motor should move forward, if IA is LOW and IB is HIGH the motor should move in reverse. IF IA and IB are both HIGH the output will be OFF*Note that the actual direction of \"forward\" and \"reverse\" depends on how the motors are mounted and wired. You can always change the direction of a motor by reversing its wiring.The Dual Channel Motor Driver module uses two driver ICs. They recommend using the IA (input A) to control the speed (PWM) and the IB (input B) to control the direction.These are very simple drives, the voltage used to drive the chip is the same voltage used to drive the motors, this means that if you are using a 5v chip, you should expect to drive 5v motors.Now that we have a little understanding of two of the main components of this build, let's go build it......", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FYT/PU5S/IVO3M173/FYTPU5SIVO3M173.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Understanding the L9110 Motor Drive Board."}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "This is where the fun comes in. I tried to make a Fritzing of the hook up to make it a little easier.  There are a number of things that need to be connected, taking you time, and making sure everything is hooked where it belongs is important. Unfortunately Fritzing didn't have all the parts (L9110 is missing). Also, I added a couple of more LEDs after I made the Fritzing.The truth is, this is much easier to wire then it looks.  But this is where having good notes to start with will really help. There are a lot of wires.On the bread board, you should have two power rails (both will have a Positive rail, and a Negative rail). The two Negative rails can been connected together, and then connected to the ground of the nano. decide on which rail is going to be the 9 volt rail, and which rail is going to be the 5 volt rail.  (I had the rail closest to the motor drive and battery be the 9v rail, and the rail closer to the sensors be the 5 volt rail. This saves a little on using long wires.) To make it easier mark them, a little piece of tape on the 9v side or a sharpie, something so you can remember which side is which. The motor driver, my driver board is labeled a little different then what is pictured in the Fritzing diagram. (and your board maybe labeled a different too, there are a few variations of the L9110 board) Generally thou, there is a Input Side (I) and a Output Side (O) -  The I side will have four wires labeled B-IA(IA2) B-IB(IB2) A-IA(IA1) A-IB(IB1) there are two wires per side (A and B or 1 and 2 depending on how your board is labeled). It will also have a VCC and GND - VCC will go to the 9v power positive rail, and GND will go to the ground. The O side will also have four wires, B-OA(OA2) B-OB(OB2) A-OA(OA1) A-OB(OB1). On my robot I've decided the #2 or B pins will be the left motor, and the right motor will be on the #1 or A pins.   Connect your motors to the O side of the driver board, Left to the #2 side, Right to the #1 side - try to keep the wires going to the top and the bottom of the motor connected the same way to each of there respective sides. On the Input side, B-IA (IA2) to D3 on the Nano, B-IB(IB2) to D5, A-IA(IA1) to D6, A-IB(IB1) to D9.  The MUX boards - We have two MUX boards, I've labeled as MUX1 and MUX2 in my diagram.  You can see that MUX1 one is used for SDA and MUX2 is used for SCL. That means that each of the 16 I/O lines are going to look like either SDA or SCL to our I2C and Nano devices. Switching is done using a BCD/Binary switching of the input pins of the MUX boards.  Since we need these to switch at the same time, Connecting the input pins (S0, S1, S2, S3) to each other, and then on the Nano board S0 to D7, S1 to D8, S2 to D2, and S3 to D13.  VCC connects to the 5v rail, GND connects to GND and to EN on each board. On MUX1 C0 connects to the LEFT sensor SDA line, C1 connects to the RIGHT sensor SCL line.  On MUX2 C0 connects to the LEFT sensor SCL line, and C1 connects to the RIGHT sensors SCL line. MUX1 SIG pin connects to A4 of the nano, MUX2 SIG pin connects to A5 of the nano.  We need to connect power to each of the sensors, VCC to 5v rail, GND to GND - pretty simple there. For the LED pictured, connect the positive side to D12, and the negative side a ground. (I used a green LED but any color should be fine, this is a indication the robot is ready to move) Don't connect a battery yet, when it's time thou, it will connect to the 9v rail (positive to positive, ground to ground)* I did add some LEDs, which are not pictured. Which were used in troubleshooting.  I used two duel color LEDs (RED/GREEN) to save space on the board. This have a common ground, so connect that to ground. The RED side of each goes to pins A0 (right) and A2 (left), The GREEN side goes to pins A1 (right) and A3 (left). When the GREEN leds are on it means that the sensors are seeing ambient temperature. RED means the temperature is higher than ambient. Which also means the opposite motor should be spinning. **** UPDATED DEC 6, 2016 - I also added a SR-HC04 ultrasonic sensor, be sure to check out step 10 (UPDATES) for more info. ***", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F50/S7HW/IVMQ27K4/F50S7HWIVMQ27K4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJQ/TMX2/IVO3M22S/FJQTMX2IVO3M22S.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQD/RJEH/IVO3M291/FQDRJEHIVO3M291.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN9/ZK8X/IVO3M1RK/FN9ZK8XIVO3M1RK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1E/G5T9/IVO3M22O/F1EG5T9IVO3M22O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFK/AP82/IVO3M202/FFKAP82IVO3M202.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHI/DZLT/IVO3M2BI/FHIDZLTIVO3M2BI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRO/IUJG/IVO3M1YS/FROIUJGIVO3M1YS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3C/X5BY/IVO3ORWX/F3CX5BYIVO3ORWX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F38/IYOB/IVO3M332/F38IYOBIVO3M332.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSR/U8TY/IVO3M37J/FSRU8TYIVO3M37J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR6/8S94/IVO3OSDP/FR68S94IVO3OSDP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8L/VVWG/IVO3OSKT/F8LVVWGIVO3OSKT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZF/Q7NJ/IVO3M1RU/FZFQ7NJIVO3M1RU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQU/6KYF/IVO3M1UG/FQU6KYFIVO3M1UG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS6/ZL4C/IVO3M3FY/FS6ZL4CIVO3M3FY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX6/SD3O/IVO3ORJZ/FX6SD3OIVO3ORJZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUT/EI5W/IVO3M3K3/FUTEI5WIVO3M3K3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJF/0MYH/IVO3M3TL/FJF0MYHIVO3M3TL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F11/IHBN/IVO3M3GE/F11IHBNIVO3M3GE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXA/45N9/IVO3M3G2/FXA45N9IVO3M3G2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4B/DOGY/IVO3M22J/F4BDOGYIVO3M22J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUB/7TR1/IVO3M3BK/FUB7TR1IVO3M3BK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Wiring Up the Parts."}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "When I started to write this instructable, the code wasn't quite done - the robot only sort of worked.As I was writing this, I was working on and thinking about the code. I made a few more small changes to the robot, including a different battery pack. Most of my work was spend on the code, and I came up with an idea to just use the sensors as switches. My original code I was trying to compare the ambient temperature to a the object temperature. (In fact this did work, sort of) - The sensors are very sensitive to small changes, and my original code wasn't fast enough to account for the small change.You can find my code here: https://github.com/kd8bxp/Snake_Vision_Robot*NOTE: The Code was fixed on github. I left the errors in here for the learning experience.Now to explain bits of it....hopefully it makes since how it works.#define units 1 //1=Fahrenheit,  0=Celius\n//Functions:\n\n//rightForward(speed)\n//rightBackward(speed)\n//leftForward(speed)\n//leftBackward(speed)\n//stop()\n//readRightSensor() - set the mux to read the sensor connected to C0\n//readLeftSensor() - set the mux to read the sensor connected to C1\n//readSensor() - returns value of current readings\n//Setup variables for motors\n#define leftMotorPin1   3 //Left IA2   PWM PIN\n#define leftMotorPin2   5 //Left IB2 Direction PIN \n#define rightMotorPin1  6 //Right IA1 PWM PIN\n#define rightMotorPin2  9 //Right IB1 Direction PIN\n#define pwmR  100 //smallest PWM value that will cause motor to spin\n#define pwmL  100\nAt the start of the code, you'll see some defines - most of these you shouldn't have to change, but it's good to know where and what they are.  This section is commented pretty good, but let's look at a couple of things.The units really is a hold over from my original code, with the way the new code works it shouldn't matter if the temperatures are in Fahrenheit or Celius - because I am now just using the sensors as a switch to turn the motors on and off.The motor functions, most of these are not used in this sketch, they are however included should you (or me) want to add something for the robot to do.  Right now rightForward, and leftForward and Stop are used.the Motor pins are the next set, you shouldn't need to change these. With the L9110 motor driver, if the motor isn't going the direction you want, you have to switch the wires around.pwmR and pwmL are both the smallest PWM that will cause your wheels to move on the surface you want.<p>//Setup variables for temperature sensors</p><p>int rightSensor;\nint leftSensor;\nint rightAmbient; //ambient temperature of sensors\nint leftAmbient;\nint rightCalibrate;\nint leftCalibrate;\nint aL;\nint sL;\nint aR;\nint sR;</p>This little block of code, are variables used to read the sensors, set up the calibration differences between the two sensors, and set the mappings of the reading values.<p>//Variables for Mux.

There are two thermal sensors, so only\n *  2 of the 16 ports on the mux are needed, meaning, only one\n *  of the mux control lines needs to be changed to read the two sensors\n *  The code would need to be changed, and expanded to add more I2C sensors\n */</p><p>#define s0  7\n#define s1  8\n#define s2  2\n#define s3 13</p><p>//RED temperatures are higher than ambient, GREEN ambient temperature\n#define LED 12  //ready indicator (GREEN)\n#define RIGHTREDLED A0 \n#define RIGHTGREENLED A1\n#define LEFTREDLED A2\n#define LEFTGREENLED A3</p>Here we see the pins the MUX board is connected to in the define s0 to define s3 statements, I don't think you'll need to be changing these, unless maybe you used a board other than a Nano.And lastly we have the pins that the LEDs are connected to - if you get one of these hooked up backward changes here can help.That is really all of the setup.in the setup function, we will attempt to get a average ambient temperature, and use this as a calibration reading. I found that while these sensors are very very good at what they do, they were a little off from each other. So by doing this I was able to zero out the error between the two. The calibration happens pretty fast, but I did put some delays in because they are sensitive and could read your temperature as the ambient temperature if you are close to them. A delay here gives you time to move out of the way.  A second delay is just there because I wanted a little longer.  During calibration the left and right leds should both be green, if one or the other or both are red, then it sensed something it shouldn't have - try again.When the robot is ready to move, a green led will come on - and now the robot is ready to sense the heat.<p>void loop()                     <br>{\nreadRightSensor();\nreadLeftSensor();</p><p>aL = map(leftAmbient, -40, leftAmbient, 0.0, pwmL);\nsL = map(leftSensor, leftAmbient, leftSensor, pwmL, 0.0);\naR = map(rightAmbient, -40, rightAmbient, 0.0, pwmR);\nsR = map(rightSensor, rightAmbient, rightSensor, pwmR, 0.0);\nif (leftAmbient >= leftSensor) {sL = 100;}\nif (rightAmbient >= rightSensor) {sR = 100;}\nrightForward(aL - sL);\nleftForward(aR - sR);</p><p>//delay(50); //test code with small delay (may not be needed)</p><p>}</p>this is were mapping takes place, the sensors get read, and a small comparison is made.**** NOTE: while doing this write up, I realized there is a error in this part of the code -- actually there are two - do you see them? It's ok, after I am done here, I'll fix the code and get the new version on github asap.** The variable aL and aR are ambient temperatures of the left and right sensor, that value is being mapped to the pwm value set by the define statements....do you see the error? So Sense the left sensor is controlling the right motor, it's PWM value should be that of the right motor, not the left (pwmR).**** NOTE 2: The Code was fixed on github. I left the errors in here for the learning experience.  It now checks to see if the sensor reading (object temperature) is less than the ambient temperature in other words is it colder (ice?) - Do you see another error here?  sL and sR should be set to a PWM value of the define statements, and should be opposite so sL would equal pwmR.Next is the little bit of math. an Ambient reading minus the sensor reading - if the sensor reading is zero than the motor should move, if the sensor reading is set to the pwm value then the true pwm will be zero and the motor should stop. This does work, even with the error in logic.<p>void readRightSensor() {<br>  digitalWrite(s0, LOW);\n  //because S1, S2, S3 are already set LOW we don't need to set again\n  rightSensor = readSensor() + rightCalibrate;\n  rightAmbient = readAmbient();\n  if (rightAmbient >= rightSensor) { \n    digitalWrite(RIGHTGREENLED, HIGH); \n    digitalWrite(RIGHTREDLED, LOW); } else {\n        digitalWrite(RIGHTGREENLED, LOW);\n        digitalWrite(RIGHTREDLED, HIGH);\n    }\n  }</p><p>void readLeftSensor() {\n  digitalWrite(s0, HIGH);\n  //because s1, s2, s3 are already set LOW we don't need to set again\n  leftSensor = readSensor() + leftCalibrate;\n  leftAmbient = readAmbient();\n  if (leftAmbient >= leftSensor) { \n    digitalWrite(LEFTGREENLED, HIGH); \n    digitalWrite(LEFTREDLED, LOW); } else {\n        digitalWrite(LEFTGREENLED, LOW);\n        digitalWrite(LEFTREDLED, HIGH);\n    }\n}</p>Here is something interesting to note, because I only needed to pins on the MUX and because those two pins are next to each other in binary counting, I only need to switch one pin on or off. Remember binary 0000 is C0, and binary 0001 is C1, only one pin changes. So these functions, switch sensors, take the reading and the calibration reading, check and turn on LEDs as needed. There is a general function used to read the sensor, because the sensors use the same I2C address only one I2C object was needed. So between these functions I know which sensor I am reading.<p>void rightForward(int speedOfRotate) {<br>  digitalWrite(rightMotorPin2, LOW);\n  analogWrite(rightMotorPin1, speedOfRotate);\n}</p><p>void rightBackward(int speedOfRotate) {\n  digitalWrite(rightMotorPin2, HIGH);\n  analogWrite(rightMotorPin1, speedOfRotate);\n}</p><p>void leftForward(int speedOfRotate) {\n  digitalWrite(leftMotorPin2, LOW);\n  analogWrite(leftMotorPin1, speedOfRotate);\n}</p><p>void leftBackward(int speedOfRotate) {\n  digitalWrite(leftMotorPin2, HIGH);\n  analogWrite(leftMotorPin1, speedOfRotate);\n}</p><p>void stop() {\n  digitalWrite(leftMotorPin1, LOW);\n  digitalWrite(leftMotorPin2, LOW);\n  digitalWrite(rightMotorPin1, LOW);\n  digitalWrite(rightMotorPin2, LOW);\n}</p>These function deal with motor control.<p>void calibrateSensors() {<br>  int avg1 = 0;\n  int avg2 = 0;\n  \n  Serial.print(\"Calibrate Sensors.\");\n  \n  for (int i=0; i<=100; i++) {\n    Serial.print(\".\");\n    readRightSensor();\n  avg1 = avg1 + rightSensor;\n  avg2 = avg2 + rightAmbient;  \n  }\n  avg1 = avg1 / 100;\n  avg2 = avg2 / 100;\n  \n  rightCalibrate = avg2 - avg1;\n  \n  avg1 = 0;\n  avg2 = 0;\n  for (int i=0; i<=100; i++) {\n    Serial.print(\".\");\n    readLeftSensor();\n    avg1 = avg1 + leftSensor;\n    avg2 = avg2 + leftAmbient;\n  }\n  avg1 = avg1 / 100;\n  avg2 = avg2 / 100;\n  leftCalibrate = avg2 - avg1;\n  Serial.println(\"\");\n  Serial.print(\"Right Calibrate: \");\n  Serial.print(rightCalibrate);\n  Serial.print(\" Left Calibrate: \");\n  Serial.println(leftCalibrate);\n}</p>This is the calibration routine, here we take one hundred reading of each sensor, and  average the values.

It does this for both sensors, the idea is to both sensors should have the same reading if the robot is sitting and there are no heat sources in front of it.

I decided to add a simple distance test. Using a SR-HC04 ultra sonic, with the Trigger Pin connected to PIN 11 on the Nano, the Echo Pin connected to Pin 10 on the Nano, VCC to the 5v bus, and GND to GND bus.The NewPing.h library is used.http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/NewPingIt's currently set to stop at about 5 inches from the heat source.I did move the heat sensors to the lower level of the robot to make room for the ultrasonic.I have updated the code on github. But let's look at the changes here://Setup  variables for UltraSonicint pingSensorIn;\nint goRobotGo = 0; //Should the robot be moving or stopped\n#define distance 5 //Stop distance in Inches\n#define TRIGGER_PIN  11  // Arduino pin tied to trigger pin on the ultrasonic sensor.\n#define ECHO_PIN     10  // Arduino pin tied to echo pin on the ultrasonic sensor.\n#define MAX_DISTANCE 200 // Maximum distance we want to ping for (in centimeters). Maximum sensor distance is rated at 400-500cm.NewPing sonar(TRIGGER_PIN, ECHO_PIN, MAX_DISTANCE); // NewPing setup of pins and maximum distance.the variables pingSensorIn is the reading from the ultrasonic in inches, goRobotGo as it says, tells the robot if it should be moving or not (there are of course other ways to do this). The define distance is the stop distance in inches. The rest is all for starting the ultrasonic.In void loop this is what has changed:readPing();if (goRobotGo) {\naL = map(leftAmbient, -40, leftAmbient, 0.0, pwmR);\nsL = map(leftSensor, leftAmbient, leftSensor, pwmR, 0.0);\naR = map(rightAmbient, -40, rightAmbient, 0.0, pwmL);\nsR = map(rightSensor, rightAmbient, rightSensor, pwmL, 0.0);\nif (leftAmbient >= leftSensor) {sL = pwmR;}\nif (rightAmbient >= rightSensor) {sR = pwmL;}\nrightForward(aL - sL);\nleftForward(aR - sR);\n} else { stop(); }The big change here is to call the reading of the ping, and check the goRobotGo flag - if the flag is true (a one) it will do what it had done before and seek the heat. If goRobotGo is false (or zero) it will do the \"stop()\" function.And lastly I added a new function to read the sensor.void readPing() { \n   unsigned int uS = sonar.ping(); // Send ping, get ping time in microseconds (uS).\n   pingSensorIn = (uS / US_ROUNDTRIP_IN);\n   if (pingSensorIn >= distance) {goRobotGo = 1; } else {goRobotGo = 0;}}This is pretty much straight from the ultrasonic (newping) demo code, adding the check for distance and setting the goRobotGo flag as needed.The original code was named \"Snake_vision_robot\", I did change that to \"Seek_Heat\" because I also modified the code to \"Run From Heat\" - Currently the \"run from heat\" sketch does not use the ultrasonic, but I plan on changing that soon.\"Run From Heat\" Sketch, currently only changed two lines of code from the original version of \"Snake_vision_robot\" code.In void loop, changing the rightForward, and leftForward function to rightBackward, and leftBackwardfunction causes the robot to roll away from the heat source.

Anyway, as they say, necessity is the mother of invention which I suppose applies here. During the summer my friends and I love to do anything outdoors. Floating the river, going to the beach, just generally being outside, and who doesn't like to have tunes when they are outside. Of course there are millions of different radios out there on the market but I just couldn't find anything that fit the bill. Either it was too small and not loud enough, or it was so expensive I wouldn't dare take it on the river or throw it in the sand at the beach. So I set off to build my own. Here is the journey to my first proof of concept. ", "title": "Ammo Box Waterproof Stereo", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Ammo-Box-Waterproof-Radio/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "HOTGLUE: Seriously, this is probably the most important thing to make sure you have when working on something like this. I soldered, heat shrink tube'ed, and electrical taped everything, and then as an extra measure hot glued those, and everything else just to keep it as water resistant as possible. Also used it to hold things in place, to hold wires in channels in the lid, and even to build little enclosures like you see with the USB adapter. Hot glue is the best. I love you hot glue. Enclosure: So I started off trying to find the best enclosure. I wanted it to be at least water resistant so I searched for water tight boxes that were big enough but came up empty. Finally settled on a plastic ammo box. I've seen them called Amo can, field box, utility box etc etc. This was one of the few things that I didn't buy online. I got it at a place called gander mountain but I think the sizes are pretty close to the same no matter what brand you get. This is the \"medium size. It's about 8\" wide which was perfect for the batter that I got(more on that in a moment). It's great to find one that has a smaller compartment on top where you can put controls and not have to open the large lid every time you need to get in there to adjust volume or turn it on/off. Sound: I found this kit on amazon that worked out perfectly: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GSLDUO/ref=oh...It was more than I originally wanted to spend but it worked out perfect and the volume and bass seriously rivals my second gen Bose portable speaker system. It also comes with a waterproof case for your phone, an aux cable, and a nice little volume adjuster. I thought the white speakers were a little too conspicuous so I found some green camo paint in the paint section at the local big box hardware store and sprayed the speaker covers. It ended up being a perfect match. I guess \"camo green\" is a universal color. Power: I went back and forth on this one and finally settled on a sealed lead acid battery. Specifically this one http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001XV8P0C/ref=oh... 1. For the fact that they are sealed and maintenance free 2. compact 3. capacity 4. cost. I found one that was the same width as my box and it nestles in there perfectly. With the way that the box tapers to the bottom it actually wedges itself in so tight it was tough for me to get back out to try to figure out how to secure in there. The battery life on this thing is just ridiculous. I charge it most of the time just because these batteries need to be as close to full at all times as possible but for a weekend vacation to the beach you wouldn't even need to pack a charger. Charger: This is the charger that I bought http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G8AIMU/ref=oh...This is the one thing that I need to improve upon drastically. My temporary solution was to run wire to two bolts that I cleaned up and attach the two leads to the bolts like you would a car battery. Turns out it just worked so i never changed it. It's been about three years now using this thing and never ran into any issues but it's on my radar to improve. On/Off Switch: RadioShack 12v rocker toggle with LED. Extras/Optional add-ons: I wanted the box to be practical first, but also have the bells and whistles that we've become accustomed to these days. Things like a battery indicator to know when you need to charge, USB charging for devices that you are using to play music, FM radio if I wanted it, Bluetooth so you don't have to keep opening the box to change songs etc. Battery Indicator I found here: http://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/Wholesale-...For USB charging I took apart a cigarette lighter adapter and simply soldered the wires from the on/off switch so it would power it on when I flipped it on. This is where I got the inspiration: http://www.subaruforester.org/vbulletin/f77/diy-ca... For bluetooth you can really find any rechargable Bluetooth receiver such as this one http://www.amazon.com/iHome-Portable-Rechargeable-...I just happened to have a dewalt adapter that I use as seen in the picture. You can of course just skip this and use the AUX cable that comes with the speaker amp combo. For FM radio I had an old Zen stone MP3 player laying around that I just keep in the box if I ever want to turn on the baseball game (GO BRAVES!) or if you just don't want to bother having someone's phone tied up.  You can find any small player with FM capabilities if this is something you want to go about.

Of course start by mocking everything up. I cut the holes in the side with a dremel using the speaker \"gaskets\" as a template. Always go small and use a utility knife to trim until they fit snugly. If you are going for the water \"resistant\" end result as I was, you'll want to make sure the speaker rests nicely up against the speaker gaskets. One thing to remember here is you may have to offset the speakers away from the battery so they won't hit the batter once they go in. Try to think of where everything on the inside will be before you cut, you can't uncut. Once you've done this you can start to mock up where you want to place everything. Again, be sure to get an idea of how far down things will be poking through and make sure there isn't anything under that it will hit once the top is closed. Don't just go cutting holes willy nilly. Even though it would have been much better on the other side, I chose to put the amp just above the battery. Only because it would require less mess of wires stretching all the way across the box, I tried to keep it as close to everything as possible, and you can still see I have a bit of a rats nest I could clean up. Mounting the amp was the only thing that required me to drill through the box. I used Teflon tape to try to get a nice tight seal on the screws and used a nut on the other side to mount the amp against the side of the enclosure. I know this thing can't be completely submerged, but my intention was to not be worried if it gets splashed, rained on, dripped on by the pool etc. So far so good. I wont go through the whole process of wiring this thing up. If you have any automotive wiring experience at all you'll know what to do here. You are basically installing an amp in a car, just without the head unit since this amp is made to be used without one. The only thing that I wasn't sure of was what to do with the \"remote\" wire. Just combine that with the power wire and wire them both to the positive pole of the battery.  I ran everything through the on\\off switch so everything powers up when you flip the switch.Again, I've been using this for almost 3 years and it's been working flawlessly. kids have played with the switch, it's been sitting in a raft on the river with a couple inches of water in it, it's even fallen down a flight of stairs. The volume has been MORE than sufficient for any situation I've been in, I've just been super happy with the outcome.

This is a prototype made from recycled and on-hand items.   Since the speaker is baffled in the back this is the easiest cabinet to build. There is no need to consider resonance or bass reflex or any other audiophile mumbo-jumbo- just build a box to protect the speaker unit. Since the Leslie is built on a 15\"x17.5\" board I made that my inside dimensions. I measured the baffle shell and the front cone and support frame and found that I needed about four inches in the back and eight inches up front. I decided on a total dimension of 16.25\"x18.75\"x12\" to accommodate the thickness of my material. The idea was to create a box around the Leslie unit with a solid top, bottom and front and partial sides with large openings to pass the sound.   I recently took apart a cheap flat pack dresser.

The amp sounded way batter than it did with its original speaker. I decided to incorporate it into my design. I partially disassembled the amp to remove the chassis. This is the part with the knobs and plugs on it. On the inside all the necessary parts of the amplifier are mounted to this bent steel plate.Since it was really scratched and rusty, I decided to take it apart and paint it. When the chassis plate was empty I determined how I would mount it to the amp and where I would add new components.   The chassis is a piece of steel plate bent at a right angle. One face has the input plug, the volume knob, the pitch controls and the overdrive switch. The power switch, auxiliary input and headphones out plug were on the other face. Since I determined that I wanted to use that face to mount the chassis in the amp I needed to mark and drill a few more holes on the other side. I needed a hole for the auxiliary input plug but I decided to omit the headphones jack since it wouldn't have the Leslie effect. The original power switch was square. Since making square holes in steel is a pain in the but I just replaced it with a heavy duty toggle switch. I also needed to add a two way switch for the Leslie motor. I marked out the new positions and drilled them out.  I gave the plate a good sanding and primed it with zinc chromate primer. I followed the primer with a coat of light gray folled by Rustoleum silver glitter paint and clear coat on top.When the paint was dry I mounted it in the cabinet. Before I could reinstall the amp components I needed to wire up the Leslie switch. The pics and diagram above explain that better than words could.

I then drilled out my own grilles based on the diameter of my speakers.(Took a long time and hearing protection was required. Those things are tough.)

Try to find a good combination so that it makes it easier to solder. The pololus will be put on top of female pins: if they burn, you can replace them easily. Before fixing everything, check that the arduino and pololu fit on the pins. The capacitor goes in parallel to the 12V input: Capacitor + goes connected with 12V, Capacitor - goes to ground. Once every thing is in place, tape it with masking tape, return the board and solder the pins (this will keep them kind of steady). A good trick to have the pins soldered straight is to solder the first pin and the last one. Once this step is complete, you will have to solder the cables of the pololu drivers: this is HELL and takes FOREVER, be prepared.Mount your arduino and visualize where the number of your pins.

I did solder together the amplifier, and since the kit was made to have an input microphone and an output for a speaker, I had to do some modifying. I wanted to have an input 3.5mm socket and an output 3.5mm jack. To do so, I cut the microphone output from a spare headphone, and a jack from a 2 way 3.5mm splitter. I stripped the wire off the microphone output, and found a wire on the inside covered by copper wires (around the inner wire). the outside copper goes to the negative (-) output and the inner wire goes to the positive (+). For the 3.5mm Jack, I stripped the outer housing and found a red wire, a white wire, and copper wires around the other two wires.

It is done purposely to discourage drunken bar patrons from blasting their music resulting in annoyance of their fellow barflys.  The standard location for the volume control knob is in the middle of the back of of the jukebox against the wall. To change the volume of a jukebox  an intoxicated listener must pull the jukebox away from the wall, grope around for the knob, twist it,  then move the jukebox back to its original position, without anybody noticing this activity. Most jukeboxes have an optional remote control on a long wire for the bartender to control the volume. Some models have a rheostat that mounted in a little box with a momentary switch.  The remote rheostat controls the volume. Twisting the volume control knob raises or softens the music volume. The momentary switch controls the \"Cancel/Reject button\". Pressing this button will eject the current record playing.  If the record is scratched of extremely distasteful it can be ejected by pressing this button. The Seeburg SMC 1 Disco does not have such a simple remote control.  The remote control uses a motor that attaches to back of volume control rheostat.  It is supposed to behave like a hand turning the control knob.  They are expensive and look unreliable. The parts are 35 years old.

Download and install the stepper motor libraries from adafruit.  I decided not to use the AccelStepper library.   This is a simple application and does not require smooth motion control. We are only single stepping the motor. A very basic example of rotating clockwise then counter clockwise is shown. No movement dampening is necessary. Download the arduino sketch programs from Github-jbvolcontrol. Create a new blank sketch.  Load the code in the following example.//// Example of basic stepper motor operation using the adafruit library #include int i=1; int dir = FORWARD;// Connect a stepper motor with 200 steps per revolution// to motor port #1 (M1 ) AF_Stepper motor(200, 1);void setup() {   Serial.begin(9600);           // set up Serial library at 9600 bps   Serial.println(\"Stepper test!\");motor.setSpeed(30);  // 10 rpm    }void loop() {    if ( i < 200) {       motor.step(1, dir, INTERLEAVE);     i=i+1;     delay( 100 );    }   else   {     i=1;     dir=-dir;   }}Experiment with different speed step sizes to get slow and smooth operation of the stepper motor. Beware the performance of the motor changes with differences in the power supply. After each test disconnect the arduino form the computer. Use the AC adapter power to see the difference in speed and torque. In my jukebox there is a fair amount of resistance when turning the volume control knob. The stepper motor controller can be operated in four different modes for a variety of performance profiles.Single - A single coil in the stepper is energized.        Double - Two coils are energized        Interleave - The energy to the coils overlaps, This gives more smoothness in the steps.        Microstep - Coils next to each other are ramped up and down resulting in micro steps.  Torque is lowered i this mode. When changing modes, the degree increment of rotation in the the motor changes. There are physics involved in rotating the stepper motor. Depending on the mode, a step in a 200 step motor may not rotate the shaft 1/200 of a rotation. Single stepping the motor in \"Single\" mode does give 1/200 rotation. An \"Interleave\" step is more like 1/400 of a rotation. Microstepping even less. It will take some experimentation to get desired performance. It also takes patience.   I have not found a formula which accounts for speed, mode and step size step size.  It seems like it should be a continuous function, but deterministic behavior eludes me. Load the Accelstepper library and play with dampened motion. Download the Accelerator library.

I don't use a router for shaping perfect edges or anything like that. Although they are handy for other things.So let's begin.Update: I realized the photos were kind of small so I uploaded new versions to see if that helped.", "title": "Electric Guitar Project", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Electric-Guitar-Project/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "First step is the full-size design. Clever readers will notice that in my design above I drew a left handed guitar. So, you know, be careful not to do that unless that's what you want. Uh, wait, it's a rear view of the guitar... yeah.If you want instructions on how to do full-size drawings, there are two books I recommend:Building Electric Guitars: How to Make Solid-Body, Hollow-Body and Semi-Acoustic Electric Guitars and Bass Guitar by Martin KochandMake Your Own Electric Guitar by Melvyn HiscockBoth of these detail the exact steps I used. Here are the extra things I did that are unique:What I started with was wanting to make a neck-through telecaster-style guitar with double humbuckers absent that big ugly pickguard the Fenders have. I like the headstocks to be angled rather that straight so I don't have to use string trees. I have some headstock designs I've done in the past and will likely just use one of those, which is why it is not present in the design.If you're going to use a manufactured bridge and/or nut, acquire those first to base your measurements around. I'm planning on a custom bridge and nut, so this wasn't critical for me. I based some of the measurements on a template I purchased that has profiles of parts of a fender neck, some on doing some online research. I'm using a 25\" scale length instead of Fender standard 25.5\". To mark the nut, 22nd fret and bridge perpendicular lines, I used a compass (procedure below). Fretboard positioned so the 19th fret aligns with the start of the body. I'm using a template I have for the body (instructions below) which I simple traced onto the plan. I'm using a nut width of 1 11/16\" because that matched a neck-profile template I purchased that's supposed to match a Fender Stratocaster. I had to make some measurements for the neck and body wings because this is neck-through (below). I used the neck-blank lines as bases to draw boxes around the wing components to give myself minimum measurements for those.PerpendicularsTo create a perpendicular line at, say, the nut position point, set your compass to some arbitrary distance (about 2 inches, say), then put the point at the position you marked for your nut on the center line, and mark points on the center line at that radius. Now open your compass a bit more, and set the point on one of the new marks. Mark arcs approximately where you think the perpendicular line will be on either side of nut mark. Set the point on the second new mark and you should be able to scribe a small arc that crosses each of the previous arcs. Now use a straight edge to join those two intersections. This line should be perpendicular to the center line. Note that you can also use a flat square to accomplish this, if that's what you have. I like compasses because they are fun.TemplateThis is the second tele-style guitar I've made, and the first time I made myself a plywood template, so at this point I just lined up the centerlines and traced the template. It's easy to make one. Get a 1/4 sheet of 1/2\" plywood from the hardware store, download a full-size plan for the body, print it out using the tiling setting on your printer (or use a big print-shop printer). Tape it together and cut out along the outline. Use spray glue to glue the template onto the plywood and then cut it out. I used a bandsaw because I have a small one I got off craigslist for $50. A turning or coping saw would work for 1/2\" material very easy. A jig saw will also do the trick. Carefully sand and plane down to your line. If you take your time and make a good template, it saves you work down the road. That said, the template for me is just a guide. I don't use it for routing the edges or anything like that. Still, it's handy. You can also use Adobe Illustrator or it's open source cousin Inkscape to design a full-size body. Protip: if you search \"Tele body svg\" you can find vector graphics files that Illustrator and Inkscape can handle and start there.Neck-throughThe widest point of the fretboard is the end beyond the 22nd fret. For me this was just under 2 1/4\", so I used 2 1/4\" as the width of my neck blank (conveniently, this equals three 3/4\" pieces of wood sandwiched together). I marked 1 1/8\" above and below the center line a few different points and connected those points with lines to mark the neck blank. I then transferred those marks onto my plywood template to serve as a guide for cutting out the body wings. My headstock will be a little wider than this, but I can build that part up with scrap pieces to get it to the final width.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F3D/I0LX/J3AF7NJA/F3DI0LXJ3AF7NJA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS5/QV27/J3AFE5P4/FS5QV27J3AFE5P4.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Design"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "I based this body design off a project in Hiscock's book because I liked how it looked. His was an 8-string bass, though.The basic body will be 1 1/4\" maple core with 1/4\" walnut top and bottom.Using my design as a guide to determine what dimensions I'd need for the blank, I crosscut 6/4 hard maple to length for each piece, giving myself plenty of leeway for mistakes. I used a hand plane to flatten the face and square an edge to that face, then ripped the pieces to roughly what I need, again with plenty of leeway, which ended up being 6.5\" plus. Be sure to mark your flat face and edge and also be sure you check for twist. Then I marked final thickness with a marking gauge referencing the flat surface. I'm lucky enough to have an electric planer. I plane down close to my mark and finish with hand planes. It can also be done purely with hand planes. For bulk removal, a dedicated plane or spare blade with a cambered edge helps a lot. You can go across the grain to speed up the  process.For the walnut, I was only able to obtain 6/4 pieces, so I re-sawed them twice after crosscutting,  ripping, and surfacing. Starting with 4/4 would have been easier, but you got what you got. I basically re-sawed them to 4/4, then resawed again in half. My bandsaw is nowhere near big enough for this operation, so I used a frame saw and kerfing plane. For instructions on making and using these tools, see Tom Fidgen's book The Unplugged Woodshop. I use frame saw blade and hardware from Blackburn Tools (he sells it as Roubo Saw hardware), with a frame made from ash arms with cherry ends. Once resawn, I attached them to a piece of plywood with double sided tape to elevate the piece, then ran them through the surface planer. If there was a high spot in the middle I hand-planed that first so it wouldn't get jammed in the machine. If you hand plane the whole thing be very careful about the high spots. It's easy to plane downhill from a high point in the middle and take off more at the edges than you intend. My pieces cupped quite a bit after resawing, which is pretty typical in my experience. This caused extra sniping problems on the ends. All surface planers snipe somewhat, but usually the rollers will press the piece flat, except at the end a corner sticking up won't be pressed by the roller, and will get sniped off. However it was only one problem corner that I new wouldn't even be involved with the final guitar so no big deal. If it's a concern, I recommend cutting these thinner pieces much bigger than final, then trim them after planing. I planed them to about 5/8\" before gluing to give myself plenty of room for error. Side note: I don't worry about the sandwiches having slightly uneven thickness. It won't affect sound much and certainly not playability. I don't really care if a micrometer would show different readings, as my guitars have a rougher asthetic, by design, than something built by a machine on a factory floor.You're nearly ready to glue. One thing to check is grain direction. Even if you are primarily a power tool user, go ahead and check this as well. If you resawed the piece, ideally each wing should have a top and bottom from the same piece. What you want is everything to plane nicely. Use a block plane set to take a light shaving and check the direction of each piece of walnut on the face that will be out ward. Mark the direction. Do the same on the edges. Mark the grain direction no the edge of the walnut that will attach to the neck. When this is all glued up, you want it to act like a piece of solid wood, with everything planing nice and smooth. It pays to take some time and effort to make sure this will be the case.That done, I roughed both faces of the maple and the inside faces of the walnut with a toothing plane (a piece of hacksaw blade attached to a wood block works just as well). I used Titebond III glue because of it's extra long open time. I applied glue to both the maple and walnut, spreading it evenly over both faces, flipped the block and repeated, then clamped the whole thing. I used handscrews in the middle, to press the cupped walnut down against the maple face. If you do get cupping, make sure you glue the concave faces of the walnut to the maple. Trying to clamp edges that are curling up is almost impossible, but if you go that road, use battons of some stiff scrap wood to even out the pressure.I used clamps and my vise and managed to do both blocks. Give the glue a couple days to set.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSD/ORJU/J3AF7NJ9/FSDORJUJ3AF7NJ9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYY/VDFC/J52Q1R6I/FYYVDFCJ52Q1R6I.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Sandwich Body"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "According to my plan, the neck blank needs to be something like 38\" including headstock. I went ahead and made it 42\" because I've been caught with too short of a neck before and it's no fun.I used three pieces of maple for the neck. Two pieces were ripped from one board, and one from another. I ripped them to 2 1/4\" wide. 2 1/2\" would have been better, but my board wasn't wide enough. Try to find 4/4 hard maple with the grain on the edge running as parallel to the edge as possible. Quartersawn is best, but I can't get that and I've had success with flatsawn so that's what I use. When you laminate them together, you'll be turning them on edge, so if you have a nice straight grain on the edge, you will be maximizing the strength of the neck. Most of the fender necks I've seen are flatsawn and cut from the face. Part of the point of the truss rod is to strengthen the wood, so it's not as critical that you get super expensive quartersawn hard rock maple. Get the best you can get, basically.I planed the center piece down to 3/4\" using hand planes and a surface planer. The other two pieces I left about 1/16\" wide to give myself room for error. Set up a dry fit of the three pieces, which you will join face to face to face and make sure that they seem to be making contact over most of the surface. Clamps will correct some gaps, but get it as close as you can prior to gluing. Another thing to check, which I frequently forget, is grain direction. Try to orient the boards so that the edge grain all planes the some direction. This will save you much heartache later. Sometimes woodgrains are wonky and a board will plane fine in one direction most of its length, then you suddenly run into problems, or one edge will plane smooth an the other won't. In this case remember that the most critical face will be the top of the guitar. This is the one you want to get as dead flat as possible, because that will affect playability and intonation. With the underside of the neck, where your hand rests, a little reversing grain won't kill you and you can sand it out.Liberal amounts of glue and as many clamps as you have to clamp up the neck. Again, you're going to get lots of glue seeping out, so prepare for that.Two days later, you'll be ready to unclamp and square this up.Start with what will be the top of the neck, which should be what was the edges of the individual boards, and plane this as absolutely flat and straight as you can get it. This is the most essential part of the guitar. Variations here can really have an effect on playability and sound, so take your time, check what you are doing and really do a good job.One thing to check, as I have pictured, is twist. Sometimes boards can twist a bit with glue and clamping. You want to make sure it is flat along the grain, across the grain, and corner to corner. Winding sticks can really help here. I use a couple of pieces of angled aluminum for my winding sticks, with one edge colored black with a sharpie. Aluminum is great because it is very flat and stable in a wide range of temperatures. You can see in my picture that clamping introduced a bit of wind. Planing from corner to corner can help. You can also sight down the length. Hold up one end get the top edge as horizontal as you can, then move it up until you get a good view of what the wood is doing along the length. I also will turn the face down on my bench and check it against my flat benchtop. Just keep working, taking light shavings with a nice sharp plane blade, and checking your progress.  Now mark that face and square one edge to that face. Square the other edge to your original face as well. Now you can check the alignment of the center piece of the guitar and make sure the outside pieces are equal thickness and that your the center of the neck laminate is in the middle as well as you can. It might help to draw a center line and parallel lines 1 1/8\" from either side of that and plane to these lines, checking for square. Take your time, again, and get this just right. Once you are at your final face width of 2 1/4\" and you are satisfied, you can run the final face through the surface planer, taking off just enough that the neck lays flat. Most of that we will saw away, so don't break your back getting it perfect. Now we can begin marking the neck. Remember you want to orient the neck so that the grain runs toward the headstock on what will be the back (rounded) part of the neck. So use hand plane to check the grain direction. This will make the neck much easier to shape.The first step is to square off the base end. Mark in from the end at the base of the guitar far enough that you can get a nice square end with a saw. Follow that line down both edges, marking from the face.What I did was lay my full size plans on the guitar and use a knife to mark out key points, such as the ends and location of the pickups and bridge, then used a pencil to mark lines across the face at these locations. Nothing is set in stone at this point and these marks will all get planed off. I have a plastic template of my scale length, but a ruler works too. This part doesn't have to be perfectly precise. I traced my plan onto my body blanks and lined them up to the neck so that the bases aligned with the baseline I drew. The headstock side of the top wing should line up right at the 17th fret. So I placed my template on the neck, lining it up on the center line and placed the 17th fret right at that location, then marked the 17th and 22nd fret and the nut locations. Then I used a square to pencil in those lines. Then I measured back 1/4 inch from the nut location and drew another squared line across the face. This is the start of the headstock angle. Your nut probably won't be a full 1/4\" thick, but it's better to give yourself a little leeway. I like to make my own nuts, so I can do whatever thickness I like. Either way, give yourself some room for error. At this point, the plan is still completely reversible. Minor adjustments are all part of the process.This is the most I can do for now until I cut out my body wings, so onto the next step.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FEY/J6FC/J3AF7NJN/FEYJ6FCJ3AF7NJN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNA/O76Z/J3AFEH8S/FNAO76ZJ3AFEH8S.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM2/Y2FE/J3AFEH8L/FM2Y2FEJ3AFEH8L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2I/GDLV/J3AFEGZJ/F2IGDLVJ3AFEGZJ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Neck Pt 1"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "I go ahead and resurface the best looking face of each blank, mark that as the reference face, square the best edge to it, then surface the other face. At this point I was thicker than intended. The goal is 1 3/4\" or thereabouts. You can leave them thick without worrying. A little thinner won't ruin it either.. What I did was take the actual thickness, subtract 1 3/4\" and divide by 2. I set my gauge to that number and planed it off my reference face, then set my gauge to 1 3/4\" and brought the other face to final thickness. This should give you roughly equal thicknesses of the walnut. You don't have to be married to 1 3/4\", though, nor to equal thicknesses on the top and bottom. Maybe you want a slightly thicker top. In that case remove more from the bottom. There are no wrong answers since it's your creation. The edge you planed will become the edge that glues to the neck, so take a little time to check to make sure you have the face you want facing the right way. Check the direction of the grain too with a handplane and mark it. Ideally, the neck and wings should have all the grain going the same direction. I like to have the grain of the neck oriented so that I can plane toward the headstock on the bottom. The reason being I find it easier to shape the neck if I can start at the base and work toward the head. This usually means that on the top surface of the neck you'll be planing from the headstock toward the base. That done, I set my template on the side opposite the reference face and using the neck blank lines I'd marked earlier, traced the wings onto each blank. We did this in the previous step as a guide, but that all got planed off, so you'll need to do it again. Redrawing your plan in a carved piece like a guitar is all part of the process. I moved the template up maybe 1/8\" or less from the guideline on my template to give myself room for error and adjustment, so what you draw is slightly more than you need.Next, I cut the wings out. I have a bandsaw, but a really good jigsaw with a long blade could work, or a 12\"+ turning saw powered by your arms. I used a turning saw for several bodies. It's hard work but you can do it. My turning saw I made using hardware from toolsforworkingwood.com. Try to leave as much as the long parts of waste in tact as possible, as these will serve as clamping jigs when you attach the body to the neck. Work slowly and stay outside of the lines. Once roughed out, I used a drum sander in my drill press to start smoothing the sides out. There are many methods. The sander works okay. One thing to keep in mind is to keep the piece moving and take breaks now and then. The drums can heat up and scorch your guitar, and that's a bit of a pain. I like to use spokeshaves to finish. These leave a nice finish, though it isn't going to be perfect. Like with any planing process, check for square off the reference face and take light shavings until you get where you want to be. I find the drum sander is great for removing the bumps and heavy spots left from the bandsaw, but I still prefer the finish of the spokeshave. Some people use a long, straight router bit to square the edges. You'll need a big router and a very precise template to do this. I have tried this to some degree, but I dislike how unforgiving routers are. A tiny error, such as tipping the router slightly, going the wrong direction, or lingering in a single place a moment too long, can cause major errors that are difficult to correct. A router table is better, but I like the finish and slightly imperfect look of hand tools, so that's what I stick with.For tighter curves, like the little lip on the bottom edge where it attaches to the neck, the only tools that will fit are small ones, so I use a small round rasp to rough it in and sandpaper wrapped around a dowel to finish. I used 80 grit then 100 grit. Once the guitar is glued up and shaped, I'll refine with finer grits, but a lof of that part will be cut away during neck shaping, so it's not worth the effort right now. A lot of times sandpaper on a stick is your best tool for curved pieces. The peaks and valleys of the guitar shape simply won't get smooth any other way, and spokeshaves occasionally chatter. I dislike sandpaper and its resultant dust, but when we get there, it's really the best tool to finish something as curvy as a guitar.Whatever method you use, work down to your lines, or adjust to what looks good to you. I then planed the attaching edges down to their final surface. I also marked the positions of the pickups and bride an each attaching edge with pencil marks. On the lower wing, I routed a groove into the attaching edge. Once evrerything is glued up and I route the holes for my pickups, this groove will become clearance hole for the wiring. I made this 1/4\" in diameter, roughly 5/8\" deep, set just below the walnut top. It should do the trick, but since this is my first with a neck through in this manner, I'm sure I'll have more thoughts on the placement of this groove in my next build.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FO1/JWI1/J3AFE4KG/FO1JWI1J3AFE4KG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSD/XI80/J3AF7NK1/FSDXI80J3AF7NK1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5U/F33J/J3AFE4LB/F5UF33JJ3AFE4LB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXQ/NLJ6/J3AFE4BG/FXQNLJ6J3AFE4BG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCX/8FB3/J3AFE4V4/FCX8FB3J3AFE4V4.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Cutting the Body"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Now that we have the wings ready to go, it's time to put the final plans on the neck and cut it out. First, I carried the marks on the top of the guitar to each edge, then lined up the wings in turn on the guitar, flush with the top, to mark where they meet and the final thickness. You will want the curve I've pictured above to be ahead of the longer piece, which is the top. That will mean you have a lot to carve away later, but it will ensure the top has a nice smooth transition from body to neck.So mark that line where the curve ends right at where the body join ends (which should also be the 17th fret.Once you've marked out the body wing locations, set a sliding square to 3/4\" and mark a line from the face all the way up to the nut. This is the basic neck thickness. Now you can sketch in that little curve as pictured.Finally, you want to mark your headstock. The exact angle is up to you. Usually these are between 10 and 15 degrees. I angle it as much as I can and still get the total length I need for the headstock, plus a little for error. In this case I tried 15 degrees but it was too tight, so I backed it off to about 12.5 degrees. Mark from that line forward of the nut. This represents the nut thickness. Measure your headstock length from that mark. If you have a rectangular ruler, you can mark carry your pencil around to get a right angle, or you can mark 1/2\" thickness in a couple of places from the first line and use a straight edge to connect the marks to get a parallel line, then eyeball the end. You'll be cutting outside your marks, and your headstock will, if you've done things right, be well within those lines, so precision isn't required. Now I use a long straight edge to connect the intersection of the front edge of the nut and the bottom line of the headstock plan to the intersection of the curved line and the 3/4\" mark. This long diagonal has a very small angle, and that will give your neck lots of playbility. You could also leave it thick if you wanted. It's entirely up to you, this is how both Hiscock and Koch recommend cutting the neck and I've found the results to be good.UPDATE: I was writing this as I worked. 1/2\" is actually too thin for the headstock for the tuners I had. Double check your tuners before committing, but 5/8\" would have been better.Before doing any cutting, I take a lot of time in this stage planning how everything will go together. I laid my truss rod on the edge to see what kind of clearance I had with my plan lines. It wasn't much, so I decided to add a volute at the point where the neck and headstock meet (on the bottom. The purpose of the volute is just to add some bulk at that joint. I've also found in playing it provides a little curved surface for your thumb to rest against for certain chords, so I like the feel of it. You can see the roughed volute in the images after I bandsawed the neck. This will get shaped and refined later. Ironically, I've only had one guitar bust from the truss rod, and the break happened at the much thicker heel, not the headstock, so trust that it should be okay. I also double check my nut placement, body placement, and everything else. You can always plane a layer of wood off and redo your plan. Really think through how things will work until you feel confident your plan is as good as you can make it.Now, it's time to take the neck to the bandsaw and get to work. Full disclosure, this is the first guitar I've actually been able to use a bandsaw with. It's way easier, but you can do it other ways. No matter which tools you use, I start by cutting what will be the top face of the headstock. Obviously you'll want to make sure your plan is facing up so you can see your lines. Stay within the waste side. You can plane material off later, but adding it is difficult. In the past I have done this and scarf joints with a backsaw. It's best if you can get a nice big backsaw to do this. I have a nice 12\" Bad Axe saw that I use. I cut from the edge with my plan and often I'll draw the plan on the other edge as well so I can work from both edges in. This isn't necessary with the bandsaw, but it doesn't hurt either. With a big back saw, the important thing is to remember to work carefully and let the saw do the cutting. The last thing you want is to force the saw , as this makes it much more likely you either bow the saw blade and scoop out some of your headstock, or you introduce a twist in the saw that takes it off course and, again, into the face of your headstock. Follow the guide lines you have drawn. Work carefully. Tip your saw back and focus on sawing just outside the line then level it and saw the length. It takes a lot of practice. If you are bandsawing, you also want to work slowly. Keep that blade moving outside your waste. If you see it drifting toward the line, correct quickly, back off if you have to. Slow and carful is the name of the game here.That part, done, I move to the underside of the headstock. Best thing here is to start with a relief cut from the non face side up to the neck-headstock joint, or just ahead of the volute if you decided to add one. This will allow you to remove that big triangular piece below the headstock without having to try to go around the corner with your bandsaw. If you are using hand tools then you absolutely need the relief cut. To cut this part with hand tools, extend the bottom line of the headstock to the bottom face of the blank, then mark a line square across the bottom face. Using that big backsaw or a turning saw, cut carefully down to the joint. I won't lie, this part is a beast. For the underside of the neck, you can either cut up to the angled line or the 3/4\" mark and then use rasps and planes later to get it to final thickness. I've done both and they each present their own challenges, but I'm confident enough now that I like to remove as much as I can with a saw before going to planes. If you had a volute, you'll want to come at it at different angles, working up to a final angle that is in the neighborhood. Remove as much as you can to give your saw blade room to get up to your line. For hand tools, you can cut the whole thing with a turning saw, if you want. What I would do is Make a relief cut about 2\" down from the headstock, use a turning saw to get that part removed, then switch to a frame saw with a 2\" blade to power through the rest. You'll want a relief cut just ahead of that heel curve to give you a stopping point. You then do the curve with a turning saw. For the bandsaw, you just work carefully on the waste side of your line. A relief cut ahead of the curve is helpful. That curve was a tad tighter than my 3/8\" blade could handle, so I stayed will within the waste side and it worked out. For the final thickness of the body section of the neck, I set up a fence on my bandsaw and removed the bulk of that strip. You could also just use a handplane. Leave it a bit thick for now, you'll finish that after joining the body wings. Note that if you planned to have the part of your neck where the fretboard joins elevated to account for a high bride, you will not want to take as much off the back. Martin Koch has some good images for dealing with this situation. As I'm doing a custom bridge, it's not a concern. If you make your own fretboard, another option is to make it thicker than standard to account for a high bridge. You could even plane a taper into the fretboard, so that it's thicker at the heel and thinner at the head, in order to give your neck a slight backwards tilt feel, and to help get the action lower on an elevated bridge. Think it through. You have options. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.Once you've cut the neck free, use a plane to smooth the face of the headstock and bring it down to your guideline. Check regularly against the edge for square. You should also check with a straight edge along the face and diagonally to make sure you aren't planing too much off one corner. You can see in one picture above that my bench has a leg vice and a crochet. What I did was lay the headstock on the crochet face up and clamp the neck in my vice. I also have a pattern maker's vise that works great for this operation. For the underside of the headstock it's more tricky. You can use handplanes, sand paper, or a sanding drum. I have a Safe-T-planer from stewmac that does an okay job with this part. Drum sander would be my second choice. Either way, do this part now because the guitar becomes much harder to manage when you attach the wings. You could also use a drum sander to smooth out the bottom of the neck and shape the volute a bit at this point.The final thing before joining is to rout the truss rod channel. Before you do that, extend your centerline onto the headstock, then mark the width of your nut, centered on that centerline. This width will help determine your headstock shape placement, so do that now while the centerline is still visible. I used a Stewmac hot rod truss rod. They are okay, but a little thick, top to bottom. I prefer the LMI brand ones, but I've also had one of those break on me, so there are trade offs. I've made many truss rods as well. It's not hard. Both Koch and Hiscock have instructions on making a truss rod. I like the double action ones because the work with a flat bottomed groove. Read those two books to learn how to do the truss rod, whatever way you choose.One final thing, I have done curved bottom truss rod channels and never made one of those router jigs you see in those books and online. What I did was use a router plane. First I routed down to the shallowest depth of the channel. then I measured in 2 \" from each end and starting there went a step deeper, then measure in another 2\" and went a step deeper, until I reached my final depth. It takes some planning, but the result is actually a pretty smooth bottomed channel and it works perfectly. In fact, I have done this more than I have used an electric router to do truss rod channels.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSD/QB9D/J3AFEGQK/FSDQB9DJ3AFEGQK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2K/R727/J3AFF2G0/F2KR727J3AFF2G0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F59/4BSW/J3AFEGQJ/F594BSWJ3AFEGQJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUP/NJB6/J3AFEGQI/FUPNJB6J3AFEGQI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0D/S7H4/J3AFF3ZG/F0DS7H4J3AFF3ZG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5P/V5WY/J3AFF40M/F5PV5WYJ3AFF40M.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Neck Pt 2"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Before gluing the wings to the neck, check again that the surfaces mate up properly and that the mating surfaces are flat and square to the top face. Now mark on the join edge of the wings the location of the pickups and bridge.To aid in the join, I used two locator pins. To make these, I hammered two small nails into the edge in a place where you won't be routing. I used one in between the pickups, one toward the base. Lay the neck face down on a flat surface, such as your benchtop, and orient the wings face down above and below. Remember that you are now looking at the backside of the guitar. BE SURE THE WINGS ARE IN THE PROPER PLACE! Think it through and imagine how it will work when joined. When you are sure you have it correct, line the base of the wings with the base line of the neck. Press everything flat against the benchtop to ensure the wings are flush with the face of the neck. Now you can press or clamp the wings in place. This will push the locator pins into the neck. You could also use dowels, but I find dowels more difficult to a line up, personally.Disassemble the guitar. Only thing left to do is glue and clamp. I like to lay out two pipe clamps on a flat surface, lay the neck down then the body wings, and finally the cauls from the waste you cut earlier. Apply a layer of glue to the neck edge and body wing for both surfaces, and use the locator pins to mate them together. Don't force anything. The pins should slide home easily, and you don't want to risk misaligning anything. Check that it all looks good, then tighten the two pipe clamps. I added a third to the other side to prevent the clamps from pulling the wings down. Probably unnecessary, but it made me feel better.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQE/NA9Y/J3AFF7ZE/FQENA9YJ3AFF7ZE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY8/W0K2/J3AFF7ZC/FY8W0K2J3AFF7ZC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFZ/C1GV/J3AFF82S/FFZC1GVJ3AFF82S.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Body Join"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "The next thing you want to do is to make the top surface of the guitar one level plane, including neck up to the headstock and body. I use a card scraper to get rid of any glue beads before I  begin. There are basically three possibilities of how the guitar my look at this point.1) Top of your body angled forward slightly. You'll see this with a straight edge and a light source behind. You'll have daylight in the middle of the straight edge. If it's extreme, then you may be better off re-doing the body join (glue will fail with moisture and heat, so use a clothes iron with a damp cloth in between guitar and iron to generate both). If there is a step right at the neck but it's flat otherwise, then your wings are slightly proud, which you can plane to correct. If you're just a bit off, then plane the surface flat with hand planes starting at the outer edges of the body and checking your progress with a straight edge. In this case you shouldn't have to take off much from the neck, which is good.2) Top of the guitar angled back slightly. In this case the straight edge will have daylight toward the ends. If you see a step between the neck and body, then your neck is slightly proud, which is okay. Ideally you want the entire surface to be perfectly in the same plane, but the reality what you need is enough surface to route your pickup holes, which means you need a flat surface as wide as half the base of your router from the end of the pickup slot. In other words, a little bit of drop off at the tips of the wings won't hurt you. Obviously, your neck still needs to be as flat and straight as possible. Plane the entire length of the neck, until you start taking shavings from the body, then you can work your way out until you get a good portion of it in the same plane. I would not recommend using a machine for this step. The machine will snipe, bow the neck, and may even cut it at a weird angle, since the end of the headstock is no longer on the exact same plane as the body part of the neck. Use a long ruler or straight edge to check that your neck remains nice and straight. support the middle part of the neck with a scrap if you need to to prevent the neck from  bowing as you plane.3) One wing is tilted forward, the other back. Basically you want to start on the wing that is higher or tilted forward first, bring it level with the neck, then plane the neck and body until you get flat with the back-tilted piece. If you were careful in your joins, none of this should be extreme and you should be able to plane it flat in a few minutes. If you have some serious issues where you may be looking at removing more material than you want, you're better off redoing the join. Though bear in mind that thinner than planned wings is less of a problem than needing to take off a lot from the neck face.Once  you have the top surface where it needs to be, flip your guitar over and smooth out the back. You only need to worry about the area of the neck where the body is. Don't worry about the shape of the back of the neck at this point. Perfectly flat on the back isn't required, though you will be doing a little routing for controls, so get it in the neighborhood of flat. If everything went right, you should mainly be removing material from the neck piece, not the wings.The next thing you'll want to do is add some material at the head stock to make it wide enough. If you have a particular pattern for your headstock you've created, print it out full size. If you don't, you can find tons of patterns online. Just pick one and print out a full size version of it. Bear in mind that if you have already purchase tuning heads they come in either 6 inline or 3x3 patterns. You need to choose a headstock that matches the tuning heads you have purchased.Line up the bottom edge of the pattern with the nut marks you made before routing. This should allow you to estimate how much material you need to add to widen the headstock sufficiently. You should have plenty of scraps laying around. I simply bandsawed some scraps and planed them to a bit over 1/2\". Glue and clamp them to the sides. When the glue is dry, plane the scraps flush on the top and bottom. Now you can trace your headstock pattern onto the face. You should get tuning heads now if you haven't already. Physically place them on the headstock as they will be in the final version as a reality check that what you drew is big enough to accommodate the tuning heads you have chosen.At this point there are two ways to proceed. You can attach the fretboard first, then shape the neck, or you can shape the neck and fretboard separately, then attach fretboard to neck. Both methods have their quirks. I'm a fan of attaching the fretboard, then shaping the neck on a bolt on or set neck. I feel it's easier this way to get a more seemless look. I didn't do that here. If you want to you'll need to plan for that before you attach the wings. The way to do it is to taper the entire neck at once, then plane the body wing edges at an angle the other way to compensate. Martin Koch demonstrates that method in his book. The problem with that for this design is that Koch was making a headless guitar, so tapering the neck was easy peasy. For a headed guitar, you could do this, but you'll need to add extra width to the headstock as well. If you go this road, draw your taper line carefully and plane toward it carefully. Use the biggest hand plane you have and start at the head, then plane back, taking a bigger bite as you go. Tapering with a handplane is easy with practice. Chris Schwarz has written several books and articles on the process if you're interested. The angled headstock will make this difficult, but feel free to try and see how it goes for you. I'm going the other route of tapering the fretboard before I attach it.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWW/U65C/J3AFFB4R/FWWU65CJ3AFFB4R.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Polishing Up the Join"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Before attaching the fretboard, you'll need to rout the neck pickup. You won't have space to do this after you attach the fretboard. Although you could chop the cavity for the pickup with chisels. I have done this. If you're going to use pickup covers, no one will see the difference. People tend to get caught up on stuff that doesn't matter to the end product. There are lots of instructions out there on how to route to a template with a template routing bit. I use the kind with the upper bearing, which I got from Stewmac. I like to use forstner bits to remove the bulk, then route to final shape. I've also chopped out the cavity with sharp chisels, and that works fine, if less clean, which is no problem if it's going to be covered.You don't have to use a neck pickup at all. But I did, so here's how I did it. First, I got the scrap from bandsawing my neck and used that for a support for the guitar. I needed a shim under the body to stabilize the guitar and my body template worked perfectly.I laid the fretboard on the neck and got it lined up as perfectly as I could, then marked the end of the board in pencil. I also lightly marked where the theoretical 24th fret would be on the guitar. This seemed like a good place to put the pickup, though I have no evidence this is true. I used a humbucker template I got off Stewmac. You can also make one using plywood. Take time to get your template right. The corners of the template can be square, since the internal radii of the cavity will just end up being the radius of your router bit anyway.Then you just hog out material with a drill down to the depth of your design, then route to the template.I don't route the bridge pickup yet, I like to get the fretboard attached and precisely work out the bridge placement, then figure out the bridge pickup location from there.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F0T/UD5R/J3KFJMGT/F0TUD5RJ3KFJMGT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS1/GQ9N/J3KFJMGU/FS1GQ9NJ3KFJMGU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLR/9T3E/J3KFJMGV/FLR9T3EJ3KFJMGV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYE/FJKU/J3KFJMGW/FYEFJKUJ3KFJMGW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOG/YTAK/J3KFJMGY/FOGYTAKJ3KFJMGY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLK/B056/J3KFJMGZ/FLKB056J3KFJMGZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3L/MIBR/J3KFJMH0/F3LMIBRJ3KFJMH0.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Routing the Neck Pickup"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "Before you do anything else with the fretboard, you're going to want to cut fret slots in it while everything is nice and square. I have done this with jigs, such as the Stewmac fret-cutting system and I've done it with nothing but a square, a knife and a straight edge. Both produced desirable results. That said, my ear is not as sensitive to tiny nuances in pitch as some people's. If you require very precise fret placement I recommend a pre-cut board or rigging up your own fret cutting system using special cnc routed templates, a sled and a special fret cutting blade in your tablesaw. For me, the price of such a system makes it out of the question. Buy a precut board and practice on a bunch of scraps if you are worried about it.Wood selection. There are as many opinions on this topic as there are guitar makers. My two cents is that people get too hung up on wood selection in an electric guitar. Experiment around, see what you like. It generally just comes down to cost and appearance for me. You do you.For this guitar I'm going to use maple for the fretboard with a walnut inlay. I try to avoid tropical woods in general, because they've been over-exploited and abused for so long. Maple is the traditional choice for Fender guitars. It's hard, which makes it better for cutting and holding frets than some other species.I used an offcut from maple I used for the neck, looking for a piece that looked nice. My bandsaw has enough clearance for this resaw. I worked a piece to about 2 3/8\" wide, a little over 19\" to allow room for error, and left it thick at about 5/8\" for now. I used a hand plane and a planing board to get the faces flat and coplanar. Take your time at this stage. Plane one edge square to the face and check with a straight edge. The square edge is necessary for accurate fret slots.Pick the prettiest face as your up face. Orient the grain so that when you plane you'll be going heal to head. This will help you put a radius on the fretboard. Leave the board wider than final width so you have some room for error when you are tapering.Both Martin Koch and Melvyn Hiscock give you several methods for cutting fret slots. There are also about a billion forums on the topic. Just do some research, pick a method within your budget and go.Here's the method I use: I have this laser cut fret slot scale. Draw a centerline down the length. I mark the frets with my template using a knife, then use a sliding square to carry the marks across the face. The proper technique for scoring a line is to start with a light mark, then make multiple passes, deepening the cut each time.I use the same square to guide my saw and a piece of masking tape on the sawplate to mark the depth. I go a little deeper than the fret tang, because you'll lose some when you radius the board. Make sure your saw makes a sufficiently wide kerf for your fret wire. If you aren't sure make a test cut in some scrap and pound a scrap of fret wire in and check the hold.At this point I set my marking gauge to the final thickness I wanted for this board, which was just over 1/4\" and planed it to thickness using a planing board.Now to taper the board. Mark your width at the nut and at the heel, centered on the center line. Then connect those to marks. You start at the end that will be narrower, plane the edge about 1/4 of the way, then start at the end again, plane 1/2 way, then 3/4, then the full length. Do this until the taper is parallel to the line you drew. If the board isn't tapering enough you can take smaller bites working up to full length. Keep checking the widths at the nut and end to make sure you don't plane too much. Check the edges with a straight edge. If you have a high spot in the middle , you can plane only there to even it out.Next I rounded the corners of the end of the fretboard with a gouge and a block plane.For this board I decided to do add an inlay consisting of a center strip of walnut that tapers at the same angle as the board. I'm also going to radius this board before attaching, since radiusing will be difficult on a neck-through guitar. To that end, I grapped a piece of scrap maple to give me a base and elevate the board, tapered it so that it was a little smaller than the board, and attached the fretboard with double sided tape. I wanted the edges to overhang just a bit, so that the router would register off the board edge, not the scrap edge. Not much, just enough to feel with my fingertips.I used a Dremel tool with a router base (a regular router would work, too, but it might be a little overpowered) and edge guide, with a 1/4\" bit. I decided on a width that looked pleasing and used a sliding square to draw guidelines down each side. I set the router depth to about 1/16\" of an inch and took a pass, then flipped the board around and took another pass on that edge. Then I reset the edge guide and took out the wood in the middle. To clean the bottom and even the depth, I used a router plane. It glides easily on the remaining fretboard material. Do this carefully, or you might chip the board, like I did.I resawed a strip of walnut wide enough to fit, after planing the face and edge of the board square. I fitted the strip into the slot with the planed edge against one side, then marked at each end where the strip would fit. I connected those lines with a straight edge and then planed the taper using the same technique as for the fretboard. For this one though, stop well short of the line, test fit, compare each edge to the board and plane slowly and carefully for a perfect fit. Cutting your strip longer than you need is a good idea so you have some room for error. Once I was satisfied with the fit, I glued the strip into place with a batton and a few clamps.Once the glue is dried, you unclamp the batton, plane the strip down level with the fretboard, and use the existing fret slots as a guide to cut slots into the strip.If you want fretboard markers, the best time to do them is now, before radiusing the board. I don't usually do markers on the face, but they are pretty easy. There are plastic and mother of pearl products you can use. I've used contrasting wood dowels and that also works well.I use a brad point bit to drill into the face of the fretboard, then insert a small length of the dowel with glue. Once the glue is dry, plane those with a block plane taking light shavings until it is flush or nearly so. You want these to be deep enough they don't get planed away during radiusing. Probably 1/8\" deep, especially if they are near the edge.Next onto radiusing: The best method, I think, is to make a compound radius. A couple of gauges will help you get them correct. I have a simple tool I made from plywood with a radius cut and sanded into each edge corresponding to a different radius.The way you do a compound radius is to plane from heal to head (assuming you oriented your grain in that direction, head to heal also works) along the line of your taper, along the board's width. What this does is remove more material at the neck than the head, because it's not as wide. The effect of this is a more pronounced radius at the neck and a softer radius at the heel. I used a radius of 10\" at the nut and 14\" at the heel. Draw the desired radii onto each end of the board to give you a guideline to work to, then begin planing until you are near the guidelines. I like to use a pair of calipers to regularly check edges and make sure I'm not removing more from one side of the board than the other. Along with a straight edge. Basically you just check at a few points along the top and bottom edge to see that the board is of uniform thickness at each edge.You can start with heavier shavings, then lighten as you home in on your final radius. You can finish with a stiff sanding block sandpaper if you want, or a card scraper (though I find scraping a board with fret slots to be very challenging) After radiusing the board, you will need to recut your fret slots. They'll have all but disappeared toward the edges. Just drop your saw into the slot and slowly work toward first one edge than the other, down to the depth of your fret tang.A slightly easier option is to make a uniform radius at both ends. You can do this with a plane by planing as though you didn't taper the board and taking more from near the edges than the middle of the face. You can also use a special sanding block at the radius you want. Both Stewmac and LMI sell these. Either way, I start with coarse paper or heavier shavings, and get finer when I get closer to final. With the sanding blocks, the main problem I've had is not falling away to one edge or the other. You have to sand heel to nut in a straight line. Check your work and make adjustments.You can also do a flat board. Classical guitars and a few metal-style guitars use a flat board (also called infinite radius, which is technically correct but kind of silly). That's the easiest, but you sacrifice some playing comfort to do that.Finally, check your board with a straight edge from nut to heal to make it as flat as possible along where the strings will be.There are other methods using elaborate jigs and routers. I've never even tried those. I saw a machine online to sand fretboards to any radius and it cost $950. If you have that kind of money, more power to you. The planing method has been used on violins and other instruments forever and works great.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8Z/HZIK/J3KFJGSC/F8ZHZIKJ3KFJGSC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM6/7XGX/J3KFJGOA/FM67XGXJ3KFJGOA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGJ/3HRD/J3KFJGNA/FGJ3HRDJ3KFJGNA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOV/JYJM/J3KFJGIA/FOVJYJMJ3KFJGIA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9O/IS7Q/J3KFJH2D/F9OIS7QJ3KFJH2D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPL/FB3U/J3KFJGXD/FPLFB3UJ3KFJGXD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYR/HDWC/J3NQUXU8/FYRHDWCJ3NQUXU8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F90/CISV/J3NQUXWB/F90CISVJ3NQUXWB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD7/B904/J3NQUXXJ/FD7B904J3NQUXXJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2O/LIH8/J3NQUXYE/F2OLIH8J3NQUXYE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1T/07JL/J3NQUY0Y/F1T07JLJ3NQUY0Y.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Making the Fretboard"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "You can route the control cavity at this point (I actually did that earlier, because I had the router out). I have a couple simple rectangular templates and I just select the one that allows for my controls. It's a simple rectangle cut from a piece of plywood. I like to put controls down and slightly behind the bridge. I do a lot of palm muting and don't like them to get in my way. If you intend to put your output jack on the edge like I do, you don't want to go too close to the edge or you'll get a jam with the wiring when you go to plug in your amp. I speak from experience. If you do a jack on the top, strat style, you route that  from the top. I am doing mine on the side. So, I put the template in place on the back, then drill down to just above the walnut top, then route down to that depth. For the plate that covers the back, I do it differently. Most back plates in factory guitars are standard sizes, so they can CNC the cover pattern on and no problem. I've found that for a custom cover it's very difficult to start by routing the pattern then make a cover to fit. I prefer to make the cover first. Make one big enough to cover the cavity and allow room for screws (or magnets if you like getting fancy. Check with the controls you have how much clearance you need. A wood cover works better if its a little thicker than a plastic cover, to prevent breaking at the screw points, but if you make it too thick, it might not fit because of your controls. Let's assume you have 1/4\" to work with.  I make a cover a little bigger and thicker than I need. I get it to the shape I think looks nice and drill screw holes where I think they should go, along with countersinks, but leave the up side rough for now so I can plane it level. Then I place it over the cavity and trace it with a knife. A low power router, like a dremel tool can work to rough out the recess. Chisels also work. I set the final depth and shape with a router plane, chisels and gouges.I check the fit of the cover, make adjustments to either the rabbet or the cover, test again, until the fit is tight. If you find your fit is so tight you can't get the cover out, use a screw driver going in from the front through one of the holes you drilled to push it back out. Just loose enough that you can easily pry it out is what I go for.Finally, I use a forstner bit to drill a clearance hole for the output jack. I determine where I want the jack by holding the guitar in various playing positions and figuring out what might interfere. Once I like the location I clamp the guitar into my vise and use a straight edge to visualize a line from where I want the jack to the control cavity, then drill a 1/8\" pilot hole into the control cavity, then follow the pilot hole with a 7/8\" forstner bit. I drill down to allow plenty of clearance for the jack and cable connection, then drill through to the control cavity with a 1/4\" bit for clearance for the wires.Now I do a test fit with the output jack and jack plate to make sure that it fits comfortably and that the plate conceals the hole. You can screw it into place just to get the screw holes established, but then remove it for now.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FKY/Y87V/J3W2BQWV/FKYY87VJ3W2BQWV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHS/ZBW6/J3W2BQX3/FHSZBW6J3W2BQX3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW0/1JBH/J3W2BQXR/FW01JBHJ3W2BQXR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTX/B6FP/J3W2BQY1/FTXB6FPJ3W2BQY1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAK/3ILJ/J3W2BQYR/FAK3ILJJ3W2BQYR.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 10: Body Controls"}, {"step": 11, "steps_text": "Both Koch and Hiscock give a method for attaching the fretboard in a way that keeps it from moving. I've used both methods and they both work fine. I've attached without any aid and the problem is that at this point we really need as precise a glue-up as we can get and even with a bunch of clamps, the board may slide before the glue sets, so it helps to use an aid.For this join, I used Koch's method of drilling holes through the fret slots and hammering small nails in to keep the board in place. These tiny holes won't affect the board's ability to hold the frets, and the fret wire will cover them up once placed. I placed the board, nailed in nails to hold it in place, then snipped the tops off the nails so I could slide the board off.A batton with clearance slots for the nails helps. I made one with a scrap, I marked the locations of the pins then just sawed about a 1/4\" slot and chiseled it out. Quick and easy. A couple of strips of cork on the edges will help the batton press the edges of the board down. I didn't have cork, so I tried foam weather stripping. This did not work, so just go get cork or a thin veneer. But I included the picture so you could see what I was going for and what the batton looks like.Before gluing, set your truss rod in place with a line of silicon sealant to keep it from rattling. Tape the slot for the truss rod with masking tape, apply glue and spread evenly in a thin layer. Remove the masking tape. Apply a thin layer to the board as well, mainly on the edges.

I'm doing a bevel on the front, rounding the back edge. I want clearance for the strumming arm and a belly contour (I know, I need to eat fewer cheeseburgers, but here we are). I did this with a drawknife to start the bevel, then polished it up with a block plane. The front bevel I did with spokeshaves. I'll clean with sandpaper later.With the fretboard glue dried, it's time to focus on the neck.The first step is to saw relief cuts at the nut to mark the final width of the neck.Your fretboard will serve as guide for the taper.Clamp the neck with one edge horizontal. The carvers vise really comes in handy here, but any vise will do. Now you want to crosscut the neck along the line of the nut down to the edge of your fretboard. Stop short of the board so you don't saw into your fretboard or mar it. Turn the guitar over and cut the other shoulder.I started the taper with a drawknife, but the tricky thing there is you don't want to split your headstock. What I settled on was using a chisel and mallet. The mallet gives you more control over the chisel. I used it bevel down so it wouldn't drive into the neck too deeply. Start with light cuts and watch your grain. You should be all right because you are going downhill, but pay attention to the grain and stop if you notice the wood splitting too much inward. Once I made some space wit the chisel, I went back to the drawknife, I used it bevel down, again to keep from digging too deep into the neck. I worked an shaving the neck down close to the fretboard and trapezoidal. I refined the taper with spokeshaves, but left it a little rough for now. At this point I like to go ahead and rough cut my head stock. For this you will need a coping saw or turning saw. You can start at the shoulder cut you just made and follow your pattern. Your guitar is simply too heavy to try to prop up at a 15 degree angle and get an accurate cut on a bandsaw, so that option is out. You're just rouging out the pattern at this point, and creating some space for the shaping tools to handle the neck. I used a jigsaw as well for the long, straight part of the headstock, but this is tricky. Give yourself lots of room for error.Draw guidelines on the guitar with chalk or a grease pencil that will show up. The big advantage with neck-through is the ability to make playing the upper registers extremely comfortable. If you need ideas go to a guitar store and study the backs of a few neck-throughs to get an idea of what will work for you. The best thing about shaping a neck by hand is that you get to shape it to exactly what feels right in your hand. That's another reason we tapered the fretboard first. Clever people, us.For the neck at the heel, I recommend some quality hand-stitched rasps. You want mainly a half-round for this work, as you'll be carving it concave. Other tools that can help are a big gouge, travisher, adze or surform. There is a lot of material to remove so use whatever tools help you along. I started with rasps, but the heel was taking too long, so I went to a large #7 bent gouge to hog out material, then back to the rasps to polish it up. I shaped the neck toward the heel by using the rasp laterally across the grain. I shaped this and the heel simultaneously, so I could hold the guitar and test the feel. I kept taking away material until it feels right. I also purchased a template for a Fender neck online that I used as a guide. Neck shape is entirely personal. If you have a neck you really like you can use contour gauges to try to replicate it. Otherwise, just keep paring down and testing it in your hand until you are happy with how it feels. Once the heel and neck feels right, you can turn your attention to the head area.For the head end, you want to be a little more cautious. On mine, I had very little room for error. Taking off to much of the back of the neck would expose the truss rod. Again, I went laterally across the grain, rounding the neck until it fit right and matched my contour guide.Once you have the head and heel where you want them, you need only to remove material from the middle to join those surfaces to make a nice rounded neck (or other profile if you're so inclined). I like to start a draw knife and shave it down roughly trapezoidal, then rounding along the length. Peel off wood and get the neck down to shape. When you are close you can use spokeshaves. Check along the length at the angle of the taper to make sure you have an flat neck that doesn't bubble out in the middle (mine always does this to a degree. I eventually used a rasp in the middle to help speed up the process a little.At this point I'd put about 3 hours total on the neck. Mostly what is left to do is sand and scrape the neck smooth.When you are happy with the entire length of the neck, you can smooth it out with increasingly finer grits of sandpaper used like a polishing cloth at a shoe shine. Take some time to get this nice and smooth and feeling right in your hands.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FIW/7UFS/J3W2FVZ7/FIW7UFSJ3W2FVZ7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2X/AJZN/J3W2FVZ9/F2XAJZNJ3W2FVZ9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQW/ZH5P/J3W2FW08/FQWZH5PJ3W2FW08.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWU/FI2Q/J3W2FW0A/FWUFI2QJ3W2FW0A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FML/98Q4/J3W2FW0C/FML98Q4J3W2FW0C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSV/D2FM/J3W2FW0B/FSVD2FMJ3W2FW0B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCK/0RL3/J3W2FW0D/FCK0RL3J3W2FW0D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1N/0CCX/J3W2FW0G/F1N0CCXJ3W2FW0G.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 12: Shaping the Neck and Body"}, {"step": 13, "steps_text": "Using spokeshaves, rasps, and sandpaper, refine the edges of the headstock.

Again check before drilling that the placement will work with the actual tuners, not just measurements. Check that the thickness of the headstock is correct, not too thin or too thick. If you need more thickness on your headstock, for whatever reason, you can add a veneer to the top or bottom or both. Matching the veneer of the body would look nice. I added kind of a half-veneer just where the tuning machines are because I thought it looked cool.A drill press works great for boring holes in the headstock, but it is tricky with a neck-through. However, careful hand drilling works well for this. Through 1/2\" material very slight variations from hand drilling won't be overly pronounced. Finally, fit the tuners and check that you have the right thickness and everything fits together nicely.Finally, I added a truss rod cover. I did a simple triangular plate matching the half-veneer.

To do this, I started with a base plate cut from walnut with a saddle made from maple. I will start with a floating bridge, set the intonation, then secure the bridge with 2 screws. In an archtop, the bridge would float, to allow for adjustment, but this isn't a critical aspect for an electric guitar, but having the bridge fall off every time you change strings would get annoying.I resaw a piece of walnut to 1/4\" thick. I cut a groove across the bridge to place the maple saddle in by drilling the ends then grooving out material with a router plane. I went with a straight 1/4\" groove for my saddle, and then I plan to skew the entire plate. You can also cut a skewed saddle slot into the bridge plate like you see on acoustics, but you will need to check online somewhere for the proper angle. Then I use a forstner bit to counterbore followed by two clearance holes for my screws.To make the saddle, I bandsaw a piece from and edge of hard maple, then plane to the rough thickness I need. I plane it until it fits in the slot. Then I rounded over the top of the saddle. My saddle will be skewed slightly, so putting a radius on the saddle is not going to work, because a skew angle will accentuate the curve and counteract what you were trying to do. The easier way to do it is to just cut the saddle slots to the depth of the action you want, then you can plane away a little if you feel it needs it. Leave the saddle a bit higher than you will want it at the end, so you can fine-tune the action.Now measure the location of the bridge. Place the ruler along the centerline and measure 25\" from the nut. Place the bridge there. You'll fine tune the location later. Mark a position a couple inches back from the bride (make the mark at the centerline). This will be where the strings holes will be drilled. Make a perpendicular line to the center wide enough to accommodate the strings.I used a template to determine hole placement, and decided to skew the string placement a little for fun.I used a drill press to help ensure the holes were drilled straight. You need a 1/8\" bit long enough to go through the guitar. Drill slowly so the bit doesn't deflect (bend) as you push it through. If you have no drill press, you can try to free hand it. If you can, mark the positions on the top and bottom, then drill halfway through the top, and halfway through the bottom. Another option in that case is to do a different sort of string stop. I've used an inset piece of wood to nice effect in past guitars.I need a mounting plate on the bottom of this guitar because I'm using a wooden bridge, in order to ground the wiring to something that will be in contact with the strings. I made one out of a strip of mild steel. Mark the string positions, draw a centerline, punch where the holes will go and two holes for screws, then drill with a twist bit and use a countersink bit to help everything sit flush. I smoothed the ends and knocked off the corner with a file. That done, I flip the guitar over, line up the plate with the through-holes and trace the plate with a knife. I used my dremel router because it's easier to control for this type of work, the refined the edges with a chisel. You want to route down to the thickness of the plate plus extra for the string ends. I also drilled a hole from the recess to the control cavity and ran a wire to the string plate to provide a ground for the electronics later. I tried to solder the wire to the bottom of the plate, but my soldering iron couldn't heat the plate up enough to get the solder to adhere, so instead I soldered the ends of the wire together and screwed the plate into place. The brass bent a little around the wire, so I used a piece of scrap wood to smash it down. This will help with the contact between wire and plate, so that's fine.I used Stewmac top ferrules. These keep the strings from cutting into the wood, but they aren't 100% necessary by any means. I would advise not putting them in now either way, since there is still some finishing work to be done on the  body.You have to counterbore for these since they need a hole slightly bigger than 1/8\".", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FMD/ZCNV/J44FOGFG/FMDZCNVJ44FOGFG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP2/FVYC/J44FOH7L/FP2FVYCJ44FOH7L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2X/U4YL/J44FOH8U/F2XU4YLJ44FOH8U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZH/YQQT/J44FOHAN/FZHYQQTJ44FOHAN.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 14: Bridge and String Holes"}, {"step": 15, "steps_text": "Now that you have the bridge location, you can mark where the bridge pickup will go.

I advise masking off the area of the body above the 19th fret while doing this work. It's easy to scratch the body with the files and such. I'm planning to do my frets slightly differently than I've done in the past. Basically, I'm going to custom fit each fret and round off the ends. I've seen other guitar makers do this and it seemed cool, but I got a Dremel rotary tool for Christmas and now it actually seems possible. I tried it once before by hand filing, but wire bends too easily for all that. Read up on doing frets. I won't go into detail on parts you can find better elsewhere.Bend the wire    Rough cut 22 frets (23 if you do a zero fret as I have), leaving them a little longHere's how I custom fit them: for each fret, I trimmed a little bit off one end of the tang with flush cut nippers, then rounded that end with a sanding wheel on the dremel. I then set the tang inside fret slot, rounded end down, without pushing the fret in, just resting it there. Now using flush cut nippers, I cut the fret to length, nip the tang, and round this end too.Repeat for every fret.This really didn't work that well, to be honest. I ended up having to file off the stray ends and I'll have to redo the ends. Fretting is my least favorite part.At the end, once the guitar is finished and ready for final setup:set the frets    level frets    crown frets", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FG2/6P5H/J4EFMTNX/FG26P5HJ4EFMTNX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F25/IHPW/J4EFMTO0/F25IHPWJ4EFMTO0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F00/MCS6/J4EFMTO1/F00MCS6J4EFMTO1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ2/ALUL/J4EFMTNY/FZ2ALULJ4EFMTNY.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 19: Fretwork"}, {"step": 20, "steps_text": "At this point I remove all the strings, the tuners, the bridge, and any metal bits. I started by beveling the top edge of the guitar with spokeshaves and scrapers, then round over the bottom edge. Like I said, I like the look and feel of a guitar made by hand, so I am not looking for perfection that comes from power tools.I went over the top with planes and scrapes to get rid of any damage done during the previous processes. I don't fill dings or anything like that. I plane them off and don't worry too much if the wood isn't perfectly flat. Your fingers are a good guide. Just keep working until it feels right.I like to take the edges off the fretboard and headstock. 220 grit sand paper lightly applied works great for this, just enough to break the edges. I take the time to refine all the tool damage done by the previous steps working my from 60 > 100 > 220 > 320 grits. I test out the guitar again in various playing positions and ensure that it feels good in my hands and fits my body. Make any further adjustments needed.If you have any dents, sometimes you can get them out by applying heat and moisture. The way I usually do this is get a small piece of rag, get it wet, set it on the area and press my soldering iron onto it. A clothes iron might work. I also have a small press iron I use for wax finishes on furniture that works well for this. A hot poker from the fire would work. You just need a concentrated heat source. This won't help if fibers have been crushed, but it should raise most dents. You can also sometimes scrape them out with a card scraper. Technically, this leaves a divot, but it's less noticeable usually than the dent.I went over everything carefully, taking the time to get things as smooth as possible. Scrapers leave the best surface. Places where I couldn't get scrapers, finished with sandpaper, mainly where the curves were tightest.For the finish, I made my own Danish oil. I mixed it a little heavy, with a little over 1/3 varnish, 1/3 boiled linseed oil, a little less than 1/3 mineral spirits (read Bob Flexner for more info on making your own Danish oil). Stir it up with a stick. Applied heavily, then wiped off before it gets tacky.Since I am ragging it on, I didn't really bother to mask off the fretboard. I just did it real careful like.Let that sit a day then sand lightly with 320 grit sandpaper, apply a new coat and repeat a few more times. I don't do any type of finish over the oil. I've tried a wax finish on the body, but there are too many cracks and crevices in a guitar that are almost impossible to get the wax out of after application and I don't like the results. I have used a wipe on varnish for the body, which builds up a little better than Danish oil (waterlox is good stuff).For the covers, I just dunk them in a jar of Danish oil, wait a few minutes, then wipe them down. I do those as many times as I do the body.When the sheen is built up, I go over the body with imitation steel wool pads, the white kind (woodcraft.com has them, as well as other sites). I like these better than steel wool because they don't leave little bits of metal behind. Take some time to really polish it up. You can do wet sanding and buffing if you like. I prefer a more natural look and feel. Buffing is great if you want it to be really shiny. My concern isn't shine so much.For the fretboard, I like Stewmacs fretboard oil, because it's a little thinner and doesn't cake up at the frets like danish oil can. It's easy to apply after the rest of the guitar is done. Any kind of light oil will work. You can leave it raw as well, but as you play the raw wood will soak up oils and dirt from your fingers, so putting a layer or two of oil on helps keep that from happening.For more information on finishing, Koch and Hiscock go over plenty of methods, and Bob Flexner's book is essential.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FHN/DFM4/J4EFN0RP/FHNDFM4J4EFN0RP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 20: Finishing Up the Body"}, {"step": 21, "steps_text": "It is possible to make minor adjustments to the intonation on a custom saddle by checking intonation, then filing the saddle back. If you plan to do this, you can study bridges on an archtop guitar and see how they file the bridge. I don't find this to be completely necessary, but I play styles more like blues and rock, where perfect intonation isn't as big of a deal.Now you will need to string up the guitar but don't tune it to pitch yet, in order to get the bridge placement.  Acoustic bridges are usually skewed slightly. I found this works great for electrics too. Skew the bridge so the bass side is more toward the back. Now tune the guitar up to pitch space the strings out on the bridge and press down to mark their locations (or use a pencil). Cut shallow slots in the bridge with a triangle file to give the strings a place to rest by detuning one string, cut the slot, then tune it back to pitch. Now check your tuning again.Now for the low E string, check the intonation by plucking the string, then hit a harmonic at the 12th fret. It should ring out the same note (use a guitar tuner if you aren't sure). Adjust your bridge until it does, retuning each time you make an adjustment. Now check the high E string in the same way, but remembering to keep the low E saddle point at the same place. Once you are happy with both E strings, you can check the rest. I've found at this point they are all within about 3 cents on the electronic tuner, which is below what my ear can detect, so that works for me. You can make a few minor adjustments with a small file, either filling at that string location in the front of the saddle or rear depending on whether you need to increase the pitch or decrease it, to bring it into that range. At this point you can drill pilot holes in the guitar body and secure the bridge with 2 screws. Now the final step is setting the action. You want to lightly plane the bottom of the saddle until the action is where you want it and you have no fret buzz. For rock and blues, I don't mind if the action is a little high. If you want to shred, you need the action lower, but the nature of doing the frets by hand is that you're bound to run into some fret buzz the lower the action is. If you plane too much off and you get buzz and dead strings, you can either try to make adjustments to the fret, shim the saddle with a thin strip of veneer, or scrap the saddle and start over again. You may well end up doing a second setup once everything is together, but get it as close to done as you can now. Finally, I set the final height of the pickup covers by sanding them down (set the sandpaper on a level surface and rub the bottom of the cover on the sandpaper, being careful not to press into the delicate veneer on top) and add some carving decoration to soften the ends and give them a bit of texture.You also want to take the opportunity to try out playing the guitar and make sure the neck feels right in your hands. It's much easier to make adjustments now.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 21: Nut and Bridge Shaping"}, {"step": 22, "steps_text": "Check that your neck is basically flat before leveling.I use a marker to mark the frets and masking tape to protect the board. Ideally, your frets should only need a few light strokes from a file to get level, but when you do them by hand, this is rarely the case. So I grind in even strokes until I remove a bit of black from all, then shape them with a triangle file that has had the sharp edges ground away (purchased from a luthier supply store), and finally finish them with a rounded crowning file. I go over them with 320 grit sandpaper and evenly, then polish with 800 grit sandpaper and a bit of 0000 steel wool.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJZ/3MJA/J4IQ67BJ/FJZ3MJAJ4IQ67BJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZY/OFND/J4IQ67BK/FZYOFNDJ4IQ67BK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 22: Level and Crown the Frets"}, {"step": 23, "steps_text": "Wiring a custom guitar is totally up to you. A site called guitarelectronics.com has just about every configuration you could want. Google search for special mods, as there are tons of forums where things have been written over the years. You can also experiment around yourself if you want to try something different.I rigged my guitar up with 2 humbucker pickups, each controlled by it's own switch and a master volume knob, all leading to an output jack. It's a very simple setup that I like. I don't do much with tone controls on the guitar side, so that's not as important to me. A tone knob isn't very hard to do if you want one, though. Sometimes I do killswitches on my guitars with some arcade buttons I got awhile back. They are fun to do. Basically do do those you get a momentary switich that breaks the ground going to the output jack, shorting out the circuit.One thing I do here is place a board covered with a cheap rug on my bench to keep from damaging my nice finished guitar. Vacuum the board before you place your guitar on it. Be very careful of screws, which like to roll under your guitar. If they do and you slide the guitar, you get a nice big gouge on the front. Not fun.Anyway, I place my pickups, run the wires through, wire up the controls. To test at this stage, I hook the guitar up to an amp and tap the pickups in different configurations with a screw driver. You should hear a click when you tap the magnets. This is at least a baseline indication that things are working. Now I affix the controls and attach the cover plates. I didn't take any pictures of this step, but did attach my wiring schematic. My original plan was to have the pickups coil tapped via a push-pull pot, but my pickups did not have that capability. They were just a single hot wire wrapped with a ground. So I left off the coil tapping part. Hot wires go to the switches, switch output to the left post on the pot, right post and everything grounded gets soldered to the back of the pot, middle post to the jack output.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FXF/7Q1U/J4IQ653D/FXF7Q1UJ4IQ653D.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 23: Wiring"}, {"step": 24, "steps_text": "At this point, the guitar is pretty much done. I go ahead and string it up (I re-use the strings from the bridge testing phase, if they aren't broken). I test that the electronics are working. I test each fret for buzz. I play a bit and see if the action feels right. I inspect it for missing finish, or anything else that looks off. If there is too much buzz, I may adjust the truss rod if needed or go over the frets again, leveling and crowning and polishing. If there is still buzz, you may just need to shim your saddle up a bit. Play the guitar with plenty of bends and check for anything that might interfere with your comfort or the sound. Look for anything you can adjust, if needed. If somehow your bridge is off center or something, it's not too much trouble to unstring it, uscrew the bridge, and reposition. If you need to you can fill the old screw holes by drilling out and filling them with a dowel. When you have it set up the way you want it, remove the test strings and add a fresh set of strings.That's it! You're ready to play!I have added a video.

The poly-carbonate which would act as a cover was finally mounted in place with hinges and the dowels to act as support for the guitar also were put in.

It sits comfortably on the dowels. The guitar effects processor also fits perfectly in the little opening at the bottom between the poly carbonate. The polycarbonate on top also is able to support the guitar with ease. The speaker sits flush on the surface however, the cover cannot be used as it takes up a lot of space which the guitar needs for resting on the dowelsI would rate the product as according to my specifications but the fact that I could have made it much better than it already inspires me to work on version II. Due to lack of proper planning and time management, I was not able to make it what it could have been. There is scope for a lot of improvement though. After submissions and my IGCSE examinations, I will complete the circuit, and give it a much better finishing than it already has. Version II of my Jam Stand is also undergoing the thought process. It will hopefully turn out much better than the first versionOn the whole, I am disappointed with my performance in this project though I did learn a lot of things. I learnt how to effectively use the various power tools and the tools here in the Design Lab. In the process of trying to cut wood on the table saw, I also cut my finger and I must admit that that taught me more about the table saw than when one is advised. Spraying Lacquer also seems easy but it isn\u2019t. I learnt this the hard way after I had to wet water sand my lacquered surface when I got a few runs. The Power planer too is a tough tool to use. Again, this too, I learnt the hard way after it chopped off quarter of an inch of a plank I needed. After that, I have always used the jack plane, fore plane & the block plane for my planing and laid off the power planer. Since my design calls for a lot of cuts at angles, I had my fair share of mistakes on the table saw as well.There are several things I would like to improve on my production; either for version II or as further improvement in version I. Firstly, I would change the material of the dowels and use silicone. This is to prevent even the slightest of slipping that happens now. The speaker is also all exposed and hence, would like to place it in such a way that the cover of the speaker sits flush on the surface. As of now, the knobs of the potentiometers touch the back of the guitar when it is on the dowels. This is of no major implication but I would like to place a rubber or silicone bar just above the control panel so that it none of the components touch the guitar. Another thing which could be improved is the polycarbonate cover. I have used it and found it quite flimsy; something which I couldn\u2019t predict before, and so would like to place wooden beadings around it so that it sits flush.[All the images were taken from www.google.com except for the photographs taken of the product and the renderings from Autodesk Inventor]", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8K/8J8V/I78VJDEL/F8K8J8VI78VJDEL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F79/V6DN/I78VJDEK/F79V6DNI78VJDEK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F97/KTG0/I78VJDEN/F97KTG0I78VJDEN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8J/LT17/I78VJCXE/F8JLT17I78VJCXE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTU/6BIA/I78VJCXH/FTU6BIAI78VJCXH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSW/7PU4/I78VJDEI/FSW7PU4I78VJDEI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4J/M2UJ/I78VJDEC/F4JM2UJI78VJDEC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6H/UWT5/I78VJDED/F6HUWT5I78VJDED.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FT8/XQWR/I78VJCXF/FT8XQWRI78VJCXF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1N/BM66/I78VJGNC/F1NBM66I78VJGNC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHY/U03R/I78VJGNJ/FHYU03RI78VJGNJ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 14: Product Testing"}, {"step": 15, "steps_text": "Here are the Images of the Final Product.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2F/LG69/I78VJCX0/F2FLG69I78VJCX0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW5/10P3/I78VJCXC/FW510P3I78VJCXC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAZ/OKLU/I70AWQ8C/FAZOKLUI70AWQ8C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUB/2QXM/I70AWQ8A/FUB2QXMI70AWQ8A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSU/FAXG/I70AWQ8H/FSUFAXGI70AWQ8H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNJ/XXLH/I70AWQ8I/FNJXXLHI70AWQ8I.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRL/R34N/I70AWQ8F/FRLR34NI70AWQ8F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0M/HPAG/I70AWQ8B/F0MHPAGI70AWQ8B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSE/44EG/I70AWQ8G/FSE44EGI70AWQ8G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYH/V0T8/I70AWQ8D/FYHV0T8I70AWQ8D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAW/D1EZ/I70AWQ8J/FAWD1EZI70AWQ8J.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 15: Final Product"}, {"step": 16, "steps_text": "This project was actually built as a part of an IGCSE Design & Technology Coursework Project in the 2013 May-June SessionThe project was graded an A.Credits: Our Mentor/ Design & Technology teacher: Mr. Naren,               Yash Gujarati               Aakash Deep               Raj Manandhar               Shivam Gupta               Ayush NautiyalKrittika Singh (Artwork)               Harshvardhan Taunk (Help with designs)Neerav Sharma Nepali (Camera and Input)Sarthak Bista (Input and extra help)Arav Bhatt (Input extra help)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2O/Z95E/I78VJCWZ/F2OZ95EI78VJCWZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRQ/0SQK/I70AWTUY/FRQ0SQKI70AWTUY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKT/T0SU/I70AWTUZ/FKTT0SUI70AWTUZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 16: Survey + Credits"}], "channel": "Speakers"}, {"category": "technology", "description": "The Fender Tweed Deluxe is a guitar amp that was built by Fender from 1948 to 1966 in different versions. The latest version was the 5E3 narrow panel version. The Fender Tweed Deluxe was the most popular tweed amp produced by Fender and was used by many guitar players of whom many wrote music history. (e.g.: Neil Young).  The 5E3 is a relatively small amp with a 12\u201c speaker and approximately 15 watts of power. It has 2 channels with 2 inputs each. Both channels share one tone stack. All control elements are located on the top of the amp which is covered in cotton tweed and painted with nitrocellulose lacquer. Everyone who is interested in details and the history of the amp, go and check the internet. It is full of stories, reviews and reports on this famous amplifier.The amp is not produced any more these days and old Fender models sell at very high prices on the collectors market. After Fender gave away the schematics and the layout to the public a lot of companies started to come up with clone kits of the famous 5E3. There are also a lot of boutique amp builders that took their inspiration in the schematic of the 5E3 and often used it as a basis for their own designs. The German based company Tube Amp Doctor (TAD) who has specialized on tubes and tube amps offers its own Tweed Deluxe 5E3 kit. I always wanted to build a but amp by myself and learn about tube circuits. The TAD Tweed Deluxe Kit was just the perfect kit for it.This Instructable shall provide guidance and information to anyone interested building his own guitar tube amp kit in general but especially to ones that want to step into building their own Fender Tweed Deluxe 5e3 clones. It is divided in different chapters and covers all the necessary work steps starting from ordering the amp kit until rocking the house with it.The build instructions for this amp kit can be downloaded at TADs web site: http://www.tubeampdoctor.com/images/File/Dokumentation_TDLX_180814.pdf", "title": "Fender Tweed Deluxe 5e3 Clone Build Based on TAD Tweed Deluxe Kit", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Fender-Tweed-Deluxe-5e3-Clone-Build-based-on-TAD-T/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The first step to start this project was basically to inform myself on available amp clones and possibilities. For a long time I was looking out to build the smaller and a \u201elittle easier to build\u201c Fender Champ (5F1) clone. After some research and the possibility to test both the 5F1 and the 5E3 at a friends place I decided to go for the 5E3 because I wanted to have an amp that would also be suited for small club gigs. The 5F1 is a also a fantastic amp and I think on build one for myself too but it is very small and can only be used for exercising and recording. After getting the decision straight to go for the 5E3 I ordered it at TADs online shop. The reason to order at TAD was because they are a German based company and close to my location in Austria. Further because they offer quality products and quality parts with the amp kit (e.g.: tested and selected tubes, original turret board instead of PCB board, carbon composition resistors, orange drop capacitors\u2026). Anyway there are many companies out there that offer great amp clone kits.A few days after I ordered the 5E3 kit it was delivered to my home directly by DHL. The first step was to unpack everything and check if the shipment was complete.

Please consider that this documents are for private use only. Anyway, the documents are available online. Besides a lot of additional free material on the 5E3 that can be found on in the web.It shall be mentioned that building a tube amplifier kit like this, is not a beginner project because voltage levels inside a tube amp can exceed 500V and can cause serious damage or even kill. Take serious provisions for safe handling and working on the amp and always check the power line capacitors on their voltage levels (and drain them) before working on the amp.Based on the shipment documents and the bill of material list (BOM list) I checked if all parts have been delivered correctly.

At first I like to say that I really love the amp because it really sounds amazing when you plug in a Fender Stratocaster. The amp also rocks when I play my Les Paul but the amp sounds best with a stratocaster type guitar. The sounds are brillant and rich of harmonics. I am really fascinated because of this awesome sound that is generated just by some tubes, resistors and capacitors. This becomes even more interesting to me because I have built the amp myself and know each part of it.Nevertheless there are also some drawbacks that have to be mentioned. First of it: the amp is noisy. The tweed deluxe 5e3s are know for generating a lot of noise. The actual electric schematic takes already some noise canceling measures like to center tab the 6.3V heater power line to ground using 2 100Ohm resistors. This helps to eliminate the 50Hz/60Hz hum that comes from the AC voltage.Second: the amp is really loud, which is perfect when playing with your friends in the band. Anyway, if you want to dial in the special tweed deluxe sound it is too loud for playing in the living room. Your wife or your neighbors might become angry with you.I already did some research and have planned some updates on the amplifier that will be done in the weeks and month to come:Add a Master Volume Add a Switchable Cathode Bypass Capacitor Add a Switchable Negative Feedback Loop Add a Stand-By-Switch Shield the signal wires (especially from input jacks and tone stack potentiometers) to eliminate noise Experiment with different ground connections Possibly add a grid stopper resistorIf I find the time I will make some videos.CheersMarkus", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 18: Conclusion and Next Steps"}], "channel": "Kits"}, {"category": "technology", "description": "I bougt DIY Fuzz electric guitar effect form AliExpress and there was so modest information that i was desided to make an Instructables to other, less experienced users or buyers.

To wire it, you need to first mount the control boards.  The Arduino is the main control circuit for this project.  It converts the digital signals from the keyboard into different pulses that are sent to the L298N motor driver to play different tones on the stepper.  The arduino is mounted to the spine near the stepper.  The L298N is mounted right next to the arduino, but perpendicular to it.  There is also a fan that is placed at the end of the electronics section to keep everything cool.To wire this, first connect the 2 power wires to the 12 volt input and ground terminals of the L298N module.  You will also need to connect the 2 fan wires to these terminals.  The 5 volt out and common ground of the L298N module will need to be connected to the Arduino's VIN and GRD pins respectively.  After this, find where the 2 coils on the stepper motor are.  There will be 4 wired, and each pair will have a resistance of about 4 ohms.  Each pair will need to go to a different output of the L298N.  The Arduino's pins 10, 11, 12, and 13 will need to be connected to the L298N's IN1 through IN4 pins(Refer to diagram above).  The two PWM motor enable pins need to have jumpers to 5 volts.All that is left is to wire the keyboard.  There will be 4 wires that we need to use from the keyboard.  Refer to the pinout of a PS/2 cable.  The 5 volt and ground wires need to go to the 5 volt and ground pins of the Arduino.  The Clock pin of the keyboard will need to go to Arduino pin 3 and the Data pin will need to go to Arduino pin 8.

First of all, the PS2Keyboard.h library decodes the signals sent by the keyboard into the ASCII characters that they represent.  It then saves each keystroke as a char variable.  There is then a series of variable assignments that assign stepper motor RPM to different piano notes based on the stepper RPM at 200 steps per rotation.  This means that the stepper motor will move a certain number of steps per second equivalent to the frequency.  For example, 200 steps per second will equal 200hz.  The code will then figure out what key was pressed and assign the stepper to turn at the frequency associated with that key.  I have changed the code to make the keys on the keyboard correlate to the keys on a piano when the keyboard is upside down.  After the not plays, the program shuts down the motor.  I have even hid a special piece of code in the program, press the up arrow key to find out what this hidden program does. Hint: Listen to one of my YouTube videos.To upload this code, you will first need to download the ps2 library and import it into the library folder in arduino.

One channel routes the audio to the output jack of the guitar. The other channel goes towards the preamp stage.\nThe preamp stage is needed to boost the signal from the pickups to a useable level, and consists of an LM741 using a virtual ground created by the voltage divider on pin 3. It was important to me to keep the circuit simple and not to have to mess around with an opamp that required a true split rail supply.\nFrom the preamp, the output then goes to another stage which both clips the wave and constrains it to a voltage between 0 and 5.1 (in theory). However, because I am using a zener diode to clip the waveform and due to the diode's voltage drop, the wave can actually drop a little below 0. This is less than ideal, but I can live with it and it does not seem to bother the Arduino much. That said, it is good to keep in mind that over time this could potentially damage the Arduino pin that is receiving the signal.\nSpeaking of which, the only place left for the audio to go in this circuit is into analog pin 0 on the Arduino.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FAB/L74N/HLJUSQ0K/FABL74NHLJUSQ0K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFY/7UO0/HLJUSQ0I/FFY7UO0HLJUSQ0I.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0P/NR3M/HLJUSQ0J/F0PNR3MHLJUSQ0J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUM/AGSI/HLJUSQ0L/FUMAGSIHLJUSQ0L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZV/ACEB/HLJUSQ0H/FZVACEBHLJUSQ0H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE6/JP9L/HLJUSQ0G/FE6JP9LHLJUSQ0G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHQ/ZOSH/HO2369VN/FHQZOSHHO2369VN.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 32: Build the Circuit"}, {"step": 33, "steps_text": "Take the stereo audio cable and clip off the connectors on each end.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F7P/JFJ6/HLJUSZHY/F7PJFJ6HLJUSZHY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZG/PYQ5/HLJUSZHX/FZGPYQ5HLJUSZHX.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 33: Trim"}, {"step": 34, "steps_text": "This circuit uses a 3PDT switch.

After months of pleading, my mother stood her ground and refused to allow me to use her vacuum cleaner in this manner.  Fortunately, only a few years later the \"Johnny Astro\" toy was introduced and she presented me with one for my birthday. I really enjoyed this toy, and I had fun designing, printing, building and testing this version.  Even with the availability of miniature helicopters and quad copters, the kids and grandkids truly enjoy the take off, flight and landing of their own pumpkin balloons.  And, unlike the helicopters and quad copters, you simply can't \"crash\" a pumpkin balloon!As usual, I probably forgot a file or two or who knows what else, so if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask as I do make mistakes in plenty.

I found my online.  You will also need a 6-9 VDC power supply, appropriate connector, 18 gauge red and black stranded wire, and maybe a 120mm diameter 2mm center hole \"press on\" propeller (see \"Regarding the propeller\" below).I have attached a PDF file containing the list of printed parts which includes the part names, part counts, print settings and colors I used.Regarding the propeller, as can be seen in the photograph, I printed mine on an Ultimaker 3 using dual extrusion with orange PLA and natural PVA.  The propeller in this design spins at a high rate of speed and as such needs to be strong.  If you have any doubt whatsoever regarding your printers ability to print the propeller, do not print it; purchase one from your local hobby supply store or online.  I've attached a photograph of the results of 2 of 5 destructive tests of the 2 bladed propeller.  These tests consisting of running the propeller and high speed then slipping a screw driver through the vanes at various distances and into the propeller path.  In all cases the propeller separated into two pieces as shown, struck the vane outer wall, and dropped out of the fan assembly.  However, even with the vane outer wall, I strongly urge that you wear safety glasses or a face shield when operating this model.  I've included both a 2 and 3 bladed propeller. While the 3 bladed propeller was a little quieter, the 2 bladed propeller seemed to perform better.  Again, make absolutely certain your printer is able to print a solid, strong propeller.I've also included two vane files, one with .8mm vanes and one with 1.2mm vanes.   If your printer has difficulty printing the .8mm thick vanes, then try the 1.2mm version.Prior to assembly, test fit and trim, file, sand, etc. all parts as necessary for smooth movement of moving surfaces, and tight fit for non moving surfaces. Depending on the colors you chose and your printer settings, more or less trimming, filing and/or sanding may be required. Carefully file all edges that contacted the build plate to make absolutely sure that all build plate \"ooze\" is removed and that all edges are smooth. I used small jewelers files and plenty of patience to perform this step.This model uses M8 by1 threaded assembly and may require a M8 by 1 tap and/or die to clean the threaded components.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FEV/CRC0/J7MFMEFS/FEVCRC0J7MFMEFS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKI/OP9G/J7MFMJ4O/FKIOP9GJ7MFMJ4O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU7/YMXO/J7MFMGUP/FU7YMXOJ7MFMGUP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F71/9PWY/J7MFMEFT/F719PWYJ7MFMEFT.LARGE.jpg", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png"], "step_title": "Step 1: Purchase, Print and Prepare the Parts."}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Press the motor into \"Motor Frame.stl\" as shown noting the orientation of the motor vents.Flip the assembly over then press the motor wiring tabs flat against the motor.

Once you have done that grab a 9V battery connector, peel the extremes of positive (red) and negative (black) cables, weld the positive cable to the free pin of the switch, and now weld the negative cable with the negative line that you peeled before, cover this connetion with tape or shrink tube, i recommend you to use shrink tube instead of tape.Finally, connect a 9V battery to the connector, and put the switch on the ON position and your fretboard should be shinning with beatiful led's hehe.

I myself drooled on them without having the slightest idea about how they worked. For this project it will help if you have some idea how pickups work.  Electric guitar pickups convert the mechanical energy of vibrating guitar strings into electrical energy. This weak electrical current can be amplified and then pumped through speakers.  In their simplest form, they consist of a coil of copper wire wrapped around a permanent magnet(s). Traditional pickups use thousands of turns of very fine (usually 42 gauge) wire that is wrapped around a plastic bobbin. Six permanent magnets, called pole pieces, are then slid up inside of the bobbin.  Because your guitar\u2019s strings are made of magnetic metals (usually steel or steel wrapped in nickel), the parts of your strings above the pickup become slightly magnetized. When you pluck a string, the string and the magnetic field surrounding it vibrate. This induces an electrical current in your pickup\u2019s coil. This is due to the fact that the magnetic field surrounding the moving string drags electrons in the coil with it as it moves. The current generated is alternating current, because the electrons move one way, then the other (just as the string does), creating a voltage that changes polarity.There are several reasons why I did not try to replicate a factory made pickup: First, 42 gauge copper wire is hard to work with. It\u2019s about as thick as human hair. Winding thousands of turns on a bobbin is tedious and time consuming. A slight deviation in tension while winding your pickup and it breaks, creating a major setback. It is difficult to solder. It is hard to scrounge enough of it from junk(though if you want to try, the best sources I found are AC synchronous motors, like the kind used in the electromechanical timers of some, usually older, analog appliances).  Secondly, the magnets of pickups are usually super magnets, which are expensive for a cheapskate like me. I had no luck scrounging any in the right shape. My solution is to simply use thicker wire. Not a lot thicker, but a gauge somewhere in the mid to upper 30s. I wound it around ceramic (ferrite) refrigerator magnets.

For me that meant having a compass to check polarity, placing the magnets so that their north poles were down and south poles were up. Which pole is up or down doesn\u2019t matter. The magnets will fight you, and generally try to stress you out, but stick them to the tape and then fold the tape up onto their sides.

There's going to be a load of extra bits and pieces squeezed in there and you will need to make some extra space. So if you have a strat style guitar like mine whip the strings off, remove the scratchplate by undoing all the little screws and desolder the pickups and pots from the jack plug. Also remove the neck by taking out the 4 screws and plate on the back of the neck.Pick a nice spot for the strumming bar to go clear of obstructions and avoiding body contours where possible (because these are a pain for routing) and draw a straight line in Sharpie to work to. Use a straight edge with a router to cut out a slot in the body, making sure it is wide enough for whatever you are going to use as a strumming bar ( I used a carpenters pencil) plus fixings either side. You should plan your bar to be long enough to go under all the strings and leave space for the mechanism at either end. In my original design my strumming bar was driven by a powered cog at one end connected to a free turning cog at the other end however I ended up replacing the free turning cog with a captive bolt. You need to allow room for all these components and fixings so it is a good idea to have sourced your parts before starting to cut.To mount your cog you will most likely need to cut all the way through the body yet your router might not be long enough to plunge all the way through. To get around this I routed my slot on top and drilled a hole at either end, flipped the guitar over and connected the drill holes underneath with the router.

I mounted the cog on a roll pin followed by a washer, a small plastic spacer, and another washer that had a flat edge cut into it so it could rest on a flat surface. I then used my bench vice to force a pair of nuts onto the other end of the roll pin far enough so that all the parts sat snugly together but not so tight as to stop the large cog turning freely. This assembly fitted into a special cavity I routed out (see pictures) which would eventually be filled in with a mixture of wood glue and sawdust to lock the cog firmly into position.Onto the cog was bolted a carpenters pencil aka the strumming bar, and at the other end of the strumming bar was fitted a bolt with a long piece of thread exposed which would later run back and forth in a slot created between two pieces of wood fixed together and glued into the cavity.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWC/POXM/J0X500IM/FWCPOXMJ0X500IM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F42/0UW4/J0X500US/F420UW4J0X500US.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUW/5WX0/J0X500UX/FUW5WX0J0X500UX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUL/A5VM/J0X500VY/FULA5VMJ0X500VY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLL/SN62/J0X500YP/FLLSN62J0X500YP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDJ/74VL/J0X500ZS/FDJ74VLJ0X500ZS.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Constructing the Strumming Bar"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Once I had cut enough chunks out of the body to allow me to fit in all the extra bits I had, there was a large hole cut all the way through the guitar and almost its entire width and I was concerned that it was likely to break in two once I restrung it and brought it up to tension.

Due to space requirements I reduced this circuit to a single pickup and volume control which is a very simple circuit to construct. Essentially it is a pickup and volume control wired in series, the only pitfalls to watch for are making sure you get the polarity of pickup and jack the right way around and grounding. With all the electromagnetic noise thrown out by the motor it is essential to get the grounding right, all metal parts need to connect to the ground side of the jack which in this case meant the ground side of the pickup connects to the ground side of the jack via the metal casing of the volume pot. The bridge is already pre wired to the jack so nothing additional to do there but worth mentioning in case you have to take the bridge off during the build for any reason.2.

We'll need to extend the input and ground pins, which are the leftmost and rightmost pin, respectively, to our new mono jack.We'll solder two pieces of loose wires to those pins, and cut a hole through the back plate, so that the mono jack can sit on top, with it's panel connections exposed through the hole.We'll glue the jack in place, then solder the signal and ground wires to the respective terminals of the mono jack.Afterwards, we'll just screw it back together and we're done with the dry signal jack.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQV/YSMP/IH9GXPGC/FQVYSMPIH9GXPGC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU4/INP5/IH9GXPTN/FU4INP5IH9GXPTN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS4/RWVG/IH9GXOCG/FS4RWVGIH9GXOCG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPA/TXZP/IH9GXQTQ/FPATXZPIH9GXQTQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDO/JPQX/IH9GXQ5I/FDOJPQXIH9GXQ5I.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXX/T3G8/IH9GXR19/FXXT3G8IH9GXR19.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEY/RHTL/IH9GXR60/FEYRHTLIH9GXR60.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 11: Add a Dry Signal Jack"}, {"step": 12, "steps_text": "Now to hold the tin can amplifier in place, we'll use two strips of velcro.Attach the soft side of the velcro to the guitar and the hard side to the tin can amplifier (we do this because the hard side of velcro will stick to clothing and we wouldn't want that on the back of our guitar when the tin can amplifier is not in place).And we're done!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FCJ/FVN2/IH9GXS1A/FCJFVN2IH9GXS1A.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 12: Secure the Tin Can Amplifier"}, {"step": 13, "steps_text": "For self-sustain mode (does not require dry signal jack, but produces weaker sustain), one sustainer jack goes in the input of the tin can amplifier while the other goes in the output.And for the dry-signal mode (requires dry signal jack, but produces louder sustain), we'll join both sustainer jacks with an adapter and plug that into the output of the tin can amplifier.

First I spent some time working out what was going where and how to do it etc etc. I wanted mixed LEDs of various colours mounted all round the guitar at first, but I didn't want unsightly wires all over it, on top of that, different spec LEDs can be troublesome when wiring them up with limiting resistors in parallel and all that malarkey... The best solution I considered was to mount very bright LEDS in roughly the four corners, and angle them into the guitar body for impressive refraction effects.   I also made the decision to lose the neck pickup for battery space, this simplifies the wiring in the control cavity greatly.. The guitar sounds nasty anyway, so the FX I chose for Part Two is a real NOISE maker... I doubt I'll miss the neck pickup, and this way it will only cost me once to replace the bridge pickup with something that doesn't sound like a 1950's transistor radio.

I drilled a similar angle of hole on the other side from the empty neck pickup compartment. One went in the bottom control cavity.In the bottom left area there was no compartment to run a route into. After much deliberation I decided to drill a slightly over sized hole in from the bottom to allow me to angle the led from below. This resulted in only a single set of wires routed outside the guitar body. I ran this behind where the bridge would sit to the control cavity, and attached to the back of the guitar with some clear sellotape. It turned out to be quite an elegant solution, however If I want a more professional finish in the future I will have to grind a shallow furrow somehow (some sort of router?), and recess the wires inside, maybe covering with something like clear epoxy. All the LEDs were fixed in place by applying a dollop of hot glue to the LED and mounting to the required angle.

In the switch compartment I attached my battery negative to the switch through my limiting resistor. The led negatives wire was soldered to negative lead of the LED in the switch compartment and the collective positive wire was soldered to the positive lead of the same. The combined negatives were then connected to the other side of the switch. Voila and Done.   Well roughly done anyway.

When the nut is in place it will probably help to file in six evenly spaced notches for the strings.\nI bonded the headstock to the neck first and then once the joint had set I attached them both to the body. The process is much simpler than the layup process. Simply apply liberal amounts of wood glue to both surfaces and press them in tight.

Before we start applying pressure there is a little ground work to lay.\nI started by unpackaging the strings and feeding the free ends through the tailpiece/bridge. You can do this after attaching the bridge but it just seemed easier when it wasn't bolted down. Next I measured to mark the point where I wanted the strings cross the bridge, setting the scale length. Once you know the bridge's position, bolt it down. Screws seem to work well in the cardboard, threading and holding like normal. Of course they will pull out easier but they are not the weak point in the system.\nWith the bridge secured now comes the real test. Start by trimming the strings to about 1.5\"-2\" past their respective peg. Feed each string, from the center of the headstock, through their pegs, turning the pegs just enough so that the string doesn't slip out. Now begin to slowly apply tension to the strings, starting with the middle two and working out and back and forth. Don't fully tighten on string, work up to the correct tuning. As you apply tension watch the weak points: screws holding the bridge, the joint between the neck and the body, and my shortcoming, the joint between the neck and the headstock (In reality it was entirely the headstock's fault but more on that later). To be honest I wore safety glasses through this part as I've seen a cello string fail catastrophically and I value my depth perception. I recommend you wear some too. When the strings seem to be getting to the proper tension it's time to break out the tuner. With the guitar tuned look at the pickup in relation to the strings. You want it to be close but not close enough that it could touch. Adjust it's height using the two screws that hold it in, the springs should keep it tight to the heads off the screws.\nAt this point there was going to be a video showing that I did indeed manage to get enough tension on the strings for the amp to pick them up and to show it does indeed sound like a guitar but a sudden and inexplicable SD card corruption wiped them so you'll just have to trust me (thankfully the images were already backed up).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F0M/K0IC/HDYZ6GHC/F0MK0ICHDYZ6GHC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL0/V0JE/HDYZJCCS/FL0V0JEHDYZJCCS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP3/HYU3/HDYZDYFJ/FP3HYU3HDYZDYFJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJC/WQBT/HDYZ84SC/FJCWQBTHDYZ84SC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9B/OG8K/HE081KDW/F9BOG8KHE081KDW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC5/JBEJ/HE081KDV/FC5JBEJHE081KDV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4W/W2ZW/HE081KDX/F4WW2ZWHE081KDX.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 10: Stringing"}, {"step": 11, "steps_text": "I did not actually make it to this point but the guitar still needs a couple things. The two must haves (unless you play slide, then just one) are a fingerboard and frets. The fingerboard is simply a flat strip of cardboard glued to the neck. The corrugation should be running perpendicular to the length of the neck. This allows us to use eplunkett's cotter pin frets. Simply slide neck-width cotter pins around the top layer of the fingerboard at each fret position and glue in place. The eyes of the pins should be on the thumb side of the neck.\nTo determine fret positions measure from where the strings touch the nut to where they touch the bridge. This is the scale length. Take that number and the number of frets you want, 22-24 is pretty standard, and plug them in HERE.\nAt this point you could also attach a strap if you would like. You may also want to attach knobs to the volume and tone pots as well as mark off some increments. I've chosen not to paint or otherwise cover the cardboard because I set out, not to create a replica of a normal guitar, but to create a unique guitar and I feel showing the raw cardboard is definitely unique.

If something collapsed while stringing then hopefully most of it is salvageable.\nFor me my oversight was in the ply design of the headstock. For some reason I didn't feel it was necessary to strengthen it against the pull of the strings like I did with the neck. This resulted in it bending while I tried to tension the strings. It just kept detuning to a certain tension that it could handle. In the profile picture you can see it bend towards the strings. There was also an issue with my machine head placements. I didn't give them any angle so the strings were touching as they passed.\nI'm working on designing and building a new headstock that will address these issues. It will be a little wider and thicker, have on edge plies, and angled machine heads.\nA second minor issue is that due to a bad assumption of ply thickness in 123D Make I had to remove a few plies from the neck which meant the width of the strings, set by the bridge spacing, was greater than that of the neck. (I also dropped a few plies in the body and headstock but those were truly redundant.) I've solved this by adding some plies to the outsides of the neck. Since they are bonded directly to the face of the body this has reduced some of the minor torsion in the neck, especially near the top.\nWith any luck these will be quick fixes and I'll be able to learn guitar. :D Thanks for reading, please leave a comment or shoot me a PM if you have any questions or comments.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FS3/PHZO/HDYZ6GHE/FS3PHZOHDYZ6GHE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDE/KRPV/HDYZ84SA/FDEKRPVHDYZ84SA.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 12: Play!

What is this?Despite all the hate it gets, personally I love the tone of my Marshall JCM900 Dual Reverb 4100 \"all tube\" (I'll get to that later) guitar amplifier, but I cant take it to the small apartment where I am mostly living, so I searched for a way to get the most similar sound possible into the smallest possible housing. Now, my modified version of the original hi-gain channel of the pre-amp, using TL072 op-amps, powered by a PC-PSU on its +12V, GND & -12V cables. The brand rename might seem a little... yeah... forced, but to me it has at least a double-meaning, as I got most of my musical inspiration from wading through the marshlands close to where I was born. Also it has of course some shameless recognition value and even more shamelessly contains the ending of my own first name. Not that my designing part on this was huge, but it still required a lot of experimentation work. In addition, I love it, when palm muted power-chords give thick, creamy and bubbly \"FLATCH-FLATCH-FLATCH\"-sounds on the high end and \"WRAMM-WROMM-WRUMM\"-ones on the low end, I dont know why, but it reminds me of wading some sludgy marshland with totally soaked skater shoes, or walking some asphalt thereafterWhat it can doThis pocket - or actually desktop - version of the JCM900 DR 4500 has no tubes and slightly reduced op-amp powering voltages, hence a lot of components are changed in order to sound as good and as original as possible. Obviously, it can't sound the same, as mimicking \"done right\"-tube-sounds with analog electronics is almost impossible. Still, personally I am very pleased with the outcome. To say: It somewhat can mimic the sound of an original JCM900 with additional pre-gain, as in my opinion, the original needs some signal boosting before hitting the input jack in order for it to really roar and scream the way i want it to (see Step 13: Testing!). An all-tube amp without tubes - you kidding me?Well... you see, when an amp is sold as \"all-tube\", that just means: there are tubes in the pre-amp AND tubes in the power-amp. It doesn't mean there are no transistors, diodes or op-amps in the signal path and the 4100 & 4500 versions of the JCM900 do have them. In fact these amps use a series of op-amps and diodes to create its unique wave shape, that is then smoothly rounded off and \"warmed\" by the tubes. Now... if you are a 100% tube puritan and still kept reading this far, then feel free to hate me in the comments section.What it cannot doI said I copied the pre-amp... and I left it being a pre amp, so don't expect this thing to be loud with high impedance headphones, and even more importantly, don't try to drive low-impedance speakers as you most likely will burn some chips! I originally planned to replace the pre-amp tubes with mosfets, but that was in no way listenable, now all the power output relies on what the TL072 can deliver.Also included in the pre-amp-only-fact: it does not include speaker+mik'ing simulation, thus don't compare it to a VST that does include such features, but see it more as a distortion effect. Anyways, along with raw output listening samples, I also included 2 samples that  were processed with a speaker & mik'ing simulation! Just scroll down all the way to access it.And... they say Marshall amps are there to be played with the volume knob full up, and they say it for a reason: the the soft clipping of the power-amp is one major component of what makes sound so sweet and creamy. I tried that with my 100W head once, but then I couldn't hear the drummer and I was so focused on my head not to be blown off that I couldn't really enjoy the \"sweet cream\". Yes I know, there are special devices that attenuate the signal after the raging stormblast that roars through the output jack, but... In the end, this tiny remake can't of course create super smooth tube sounds.

Never have the PSU-casing open when it is connected to the mains - high voltage!(!) Make sure you wait a while after disconnecting the PSU from the mains cable and before opening the case, as high voltage may still be carried by the big capacitors!Knowing that, the green cable needs to be connected to a black one for the PSU to spin up the fan and start to supply the voltages we need, as shown in the picture and explained in the mentioned Instructables.(!) If your PSU is not running smoothly, stops after some minutes or does other things it's not supposed to, then please refer to  the mentioned Instructables for help!When your PSU is running and does supply the voltages we need, you can cut all the non-needed wires (the ones not ending in the fat ATX-connector) inside the casing. (!) Make sure that cut cable ends will not accidently connect to each other or the casing! Heatshrinks, hot glue or other means of insulation should be applied!Now it is purposeful to rearrange the +12V (yellow) calble on the ATX-connector as shown in the picture, as this step brings all the needed supply voltages together so you can make a small plug for easy connection.(!)

I recommend looking at those, but if you are new to, yet interested in guitar amplifier technology and schematics, then please take it easy, go slow and first read about op-amps and tube amplification principles. In any case I recommend reading some of Rob Robinette's super educative amp sites (but be warned, he is totally what I like to call a \"tube puritan\", just watch the solid state memes)!Now... The JCM900 4100/4500 pre-amp schematics appear rather frightening at the first glance, as they are super packed with stuff. The original features switchable \"clean-to-slightly-overdriven\" and \"rock-to-metal-distorted\" channels. The switching is done by the switchable M5201 op-amps, and they are fed with +15V/-15V. In my remake, there is only the more distorted channel, thus it uses the non-switchable but equivalent, easier to get and cheaper TL072 op-amps, powered with +12V/-12V, as mentioned before. Also, my version does neither feature tubes nor a spring hall effect, further narrowing down the important region of the schematic.The actually relevant parts  and signal path of the original schematics are highlighted in green in the picture above, plus it states replacement and adjustment components. Further added parts and the full schematic of the Pocket version will be presented in the subsequent steps. Other than the JCM800, the early \"Master Volume\" versions of the JCM900 featured diodes in the signal path, which makes these amps very unpopular among tube puritans, at least today. Then, with extensive use of op-amp amplification and diode-clipping in the 4100 & 4500 models, although very popular in the 90's, these  are now even less favored ones. People complain about their \"scratchy\"  and \"cold\" sound, still I do like it and I know many others do as well.Tube amplification - or shall I say \"the tube cult\" - is actually a very polarizing topic among guitarists; while it is definitely true that tubes are capable of producing soft, warm overdrive and clean sounds that cannot be properly mimicked by semiconductor technology, there is also excessive hate for any semiconductors appearing in circuits at least among the puritans. Especially \"solid state\" amps (these have tube pre-amps but transistor power stages) are hated by many who never turn their amp up such as to experience the actual advantages of tube power stages. My personal \"favorites\" are those who feed their full-tube amps only after a \"tube screamer\" pedal just for the cult of the name, which in fact actually has op amps and diodes to mimic tube distortion! Further, blind tests have shown even audiophile guitarists usually can't tell solid state amps from their 100% tube counterparts. My advice: Be open minded, try everything for yourself and trust your ears, not people who want to tell you who's best.And... if you are used to DIY-approaches like \"op-amp-overstressing\"-kind of distortions, then you will be amazed by how well balanced and \"sweet and creamy\" this preamp can sound even without tubes!

The full schematic will be shown in Step 7: Wholesale Schematic.Still, if you are - like me - a little clumsy and easily losing track when prototyping bigger schematics, I recommend trying everything out on a stick board and only then solder everything onto a perf board. Things become more familiar and intuitive after experimenting with the sticking pattern! Unluckily, I did not photograph the stick board prototype and now I miss some components to make a second one, so I can only show you the soldered version of the pre-amp.Take your time, compare the original schematics with my own drawn ones if you are unsure how and where to stick the components, and be cautious about the power supply terminals! Shorting them will stop the PSU, which is short-circuit protected and it will start up again after removing and re-applying the \"power-on-connector\" (green-to-black-bridge), but reverse voltage to the chips and over-voltage to the LEDs can do some damage!I can recommend to begin the building of the circuit at the input and test it for the first time as soon as you have sticked the first amplification stage, keeping in mind the following steps of hazard-minimization. Repeat the testing after each amplification step: (!) Make sure you always have a series of a coupling capacitor and a resistor of few kOhm between the op-amp output and the speaker/headphones. The cap prevents DC-offset, which would drain power from the op-amp and can lead to quick production of heat and burning of the chip, while the resistor keeps the impedance up and prevents over-loading of the chip that could occur even without DC offset, plus protecting your ears in case of low-impedance headphones!(!) Also, always disconnect the PSU completely and measure the resistance between the power supply rails on the stickboard before applying the voltage. (Should be at least a few kOhm)(!) Next, make sure the output of the op-amp is not connected to GND by resistors smaller than a few kOhm, as again, over-loading the output can lead to heat and destruction. Then you can connect and turn on the PSU while carefully monitoring the chips' temperature with a finger.(!) remove your finger instantly if you feel heat to prevent burning your skin! Only then try to quickly turn off or remove the PSU-power.If you hear something like 50/60 Hz mains humming, or strange noises if you touch the input pin, thats great, that part of the schematic seems to work then!If your phones are silent, just have another temperature check of the chips, just in case! If negative, the resistor before the phones might be too large, carefully proceed to smaller-Ohm-rated ones, but stay in the kOhm region unless you really know what you are doing!Watch the 1N4007-diode clipper well! It is basically a rectifier bridge with a 5th diode connected such that the rectified current can flow through it. However, some smart guy in a forum wrote this circuit was actually less of a rectifier than a frequency-doubler!For the interest of how it would sound, I made the 5th diode exchangeable (you can see this in one of the pictures above) to try the sound of different diode types like shottky, zener, LEDs, small signal, fast recovery and unknown ones, but I can tell you to spare the parts and effort, as nothing sounded anything close, basically all of the non-1N4007 types sounded crappy. Maybe someone wants to change all 5 diodes and report the experience, but I have the feeling that it won't get better.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FMS/OJQ3/JM6KZTZC/FMSOJQ3JM6KZTZC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ6/NN70/JM6KZSJC/FJ6NN70JM6KZSJC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F61/17GY/JM6KZWXV/F6117GYJM6KZWXV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZE/3Q46/JM6KZV19/FZE3Q46JM6KZV19.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: The Pre-Amp of the \"Pocket\"-Version"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "If you watch the original schematics well, you see the signal after the last M5201 Op-amp is subjected to high-Ohm resistors and tube amplification steps. I have tried replacements to mimic the tube sound:MOSFETs directly replacing the tubes, but powered by +12V/-12V instead of high voltage DC. Result: extremely fizzy and saw-tooth like. nowhere tube-like at all, no matter what the resistor values were.      MOSFET clipping - using the MOSFET transistor as a clipping diodeResult: just as fizzy and saw-toothy as before      The op-amp clipping circuit used by the world famous Tube Screamer pedal.Result: so smooth that any of the much-appreciated distortion from before seems to disappear.       LEDs are said to have smoother clipping characteristics than power rectifier or even small signal diodes, also they have higher forward voltages, resulting in smoother tone and higher output volume.Result: Indeed, there is a rounding-off-effect to the spiky peaks of the waveform, but it is nowhere close to being tube-like. Probably you would still rather call it a cutting-off-effect.Single LEDs would cut off too much of the wave, making it basically a square wave - and you could hear that. Also, I feared the LEDs would burn at so much peak voltage without pre-resistors. Thus, I put 2 LEDs in series for each direction, leaving just the portion of the wave that i felt was purposeful. Excessive \"fizz\" produced from the LED clipping can be controlled by a capacitor in parallel that eats away the high frequency noise.Despite failing the initial target, I still kept the LED-clipper, as it added just that little bit of distortion that I had missed when playing palm muted power chords of more extreme styles such as Death Metal or Grind, where you expect a thick and heavy wall of sound roaring and vibrating from under your muting palm and only then, the pinch harmonics cut through at full power.However the LED-clipper is totally detrimental when playing softer styles such as blues or rock, as with less saturated gain levels, the LEDs cut off the peaks when exceeding a certain amplitude level, thus only affecting louder notes and shattering them in very unpleasant noise.So decide for yourself from my description or better from your own experience whether you would like to have such a post clipper or not! Just please be nice, some like more extreme levels of distortion others don't. No one needs to like the one or the other, but everyone is best off accepting that different people have different needs even if some of them might appear odd to others.To stay flexible, it would be best to make the clipper switchable (like depicted in the schematic) or stick-able with exchangable \"Fizz-Limitation\" caps. This is what I did, using a broken IC-socket to stick or unstick the clipper and/or various sized caps (as depicted in the photos).(!)

The wholesale schematics in the next step are drawn featuring all the  components that I actually used.Apart from that, please watch the schematic well and bring it on your stick board and/or perf board. Be careful with the capacitor values, they can have a big impact on both, frequency roll-off and overall loudness. If you don't have cap's with the correct values, you can try the closest ones you have, or put smaller capacitors in parallel so they sum up in capacitance (Cresult = C1+C2) or put larger ones in series, then the reciprocal of the total capacitance is the sum of the reciprocals of the individual caps (1/Cresult = 1/C1 + 1/C2)You can, of course, put the EQ on the same board as the pre-amp (and LED-clipper); in this case, you find the complete schematic in the next step!The equalizer you see in the original schematic seems to be solely applicable for high voltage signals as encountered after the pre-amp tubes. To be honest, I dont have too much of an idea how the original EQ should work (please leave a comment if you do!), but I experienced it did not work with the signal that came from the no-tube design. Hence, I designed my own passive EQ, one that I understand and where I can explain the basic workings to you:Every capacitor that is placed parallel to the load (eg. headphones) - or in other words: that leads from the signal directly to the ground - eats away the treble content above its threshhold frequency. As you dont want your treble to disapear when you turn up the bass, all such parallel capacitors must have un-coupling-resistors before and after its position, so neither the input nor the output signal is deprived of its treble content. This is why the \"BASS\" lane hase those resistors at both sides and the the \"MID\" lane only after the paralell cap.Every capacitor that is placed in series with the load allows only the treble content above its threshhold frequency to pass, but this does not affect the other lanes, hence un-coupling is not necessary. As there is plenty of high frequency noise in the signal, the \"TREBLE\" lane needs a resistor in series to be controllable in a similar range of loudness as the other lanes.The \"MID\" lane has both, series and parallel capacitors, thus the treble is cut above its range, and the bass is cut below.The dimensioning of all the parts is a tricky thing to do in a passive EQ, as too much un-coupling leads to substantial loss of signal strength, but too little un-coupling makes the bass knob eat away the higher frequencies. I think the one I built is a bit on the \"too-little\"-side. But I think the bass is enough even if not 11'ed and the loudness is already pretty low.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F33/J05K/JM6KZTTQ/F33J05KJM6KZTTQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FES/73ZR/JM6KZURR/FES73ZRJM6KZURR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV1/9KLQ/JM6KZUUY/FV19KLQJM6KZUUY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ9/AV1K/JM6KZURP/FQ9AV1KJM6KZURP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: The Equalizer"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "Now finally, the whole thing!Try to solder that to a perf board, refer to the previous steps whenever needed and check the function before preparing the housing!Pay attention to the pin usage of the headphone jack: use a stereo jack (or you will hear only with one ear, highly unpleasant!) and connect the tip and ring pins both to the output signal.

Spin it fast but do not press down the tip (avoid axial pressure)!    When the cutting edges at the perimeter of the drill start to cut into the plastic, finger-spinning the drill will get tough and dangerous, don't slice your skin!.    Mount the drill to a chuck tool for increased torsion force. I would discourage the use of heavy (in terms of weight) electric equipment, as you crack the plastic easily even if super cautious.    Continue the drilling with increased torsion force, but stay on a minimum axial force!

Re-fit and glue the leather cover    Find the holes that need to pass through the leather and cut an X-shape into the leather. if needed, pry open the X-shape and remove the 4 triangular parts that now cover the holeThe lid will be covered completely with leather, so no painting needs to be applied, hence you can follow the procedure shown in the pictures and described in the following:Roll the lid over the leather and mark the edges as shown in the pictures    Repeat for all 4 sides    Extend the markings until you have a full rectangle (if a missing corner happens to you as in the pictures, make sure it will be one of the further back corners ;)    Cut out the rectangular sheet    Place the lid on its center    Fit and glue the sheet on 2 opposite edges, leaving gaps at the corners    Glue the remaining edges, again leaving the corners    Fold the edges of the sheet to form a triangular latch, apply glue to fix their shape    Glue the latches down onto the lid such that the round corner can be seen    Keep an eye on the direction of the latching, probably it is the best practice to let them all face back", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F39/1YRT/JM6KZV49/F391YRTJM6KZV49.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7X/LR81/JM6KZWGM/F7XLR81JM6KZWGM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEP/XGCP/JM6KZWKC/FEPXGCPJM6KZWKC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1N/ZZ5U/JM6KZWM8/F1NZZ5UJM6KZWM8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F58/93WS/JM6KZWO4/F5893WSJM6KZWO4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F70/QG4U/JM6KZWIH/F70QG4UJM6KZWIH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXB/J33C/JM8ABAGR/FXBJ33CJM8ABAGR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0A/NJZN/JM6KZWER/F0ANJZNJM6KZWER.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNA/TZLI/JM6KZWAA/FNATZLIJM6KZWAA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFW/5QAY/JM6KZWC5/FFW5QAYJM6KZWC5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLR/DHHZ/JM6KZW5T/FLRDHHZJM6KZW5T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB0/ACJ8/JM6KZW39/FB0ACJ8JM6KZW39.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD7/IUKX/JM6KZVAE/FD7IUKXJM6KZVAE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPN/PLH4/JM6KZV4A/FPNPLH4JM6KZV4A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBU/96TG/JM6KZVE7/FBU96TGJM6KZVE7.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Housing: Paintjob & the Faux Leather Cover"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "Now, hopefully your housing has proper sized holes for all the components that need to cross the housing wall.The best would be if all your interface components would be screw-able at the interface.

They get all twisted while coiling them, then in the spring, uncoiling them usually turns each coil into a knotted pile.Of course you can buy carts with a drum and crank which I'm sure work well but each costs at least $40 and holds one hose.

What this hack allows you to do is to tap into the radio\u2019s amplifier so you can play guitar through it.  You may be thinking why in hell would I want to do that!  Well hacking a radio (especially a vintage radio) gives you the most amazing vintage tone.  The distinct \u201cLo-fidelity\u201d sounds that come out of these vintage radio\u2019s will really surprise you.  It\u2019s a real raw and dirty sound which is perfect for playing some bluesy riffs.   There is also the added bonus of creating your very own sound as no 2 radios are ever alike.  When you get your hands on a radio that you want to hack, there is a good change that it would have seen some miles.  You\u2019ll probably find that the speaker hisses or rattles, the volume jumps around or it has some other left-of-centre feature which is what makes these amps so cool.

The second radio was a little more older but I found that this was even easier to hack!  The back just clipped off and there as some cardboard hiding all of the electronics!Types of radio'sThere isn't really many radio's that can't be modified into an amp.  The trick is to find one that has some style and is large enough to pump out some decent sound.  You can modify small transistor radios but you'll probably find that they aren't very loud or have any distortion.  Reason being that they are too compact.   If the radio has no handle and a wrist strap or is in a little leather case it will be a bit too small to waste you time with.  This is due to the small, crappy speaker that they come with. Look for a radio that's at least 5 by 5 inches or so with at least a 3 inch speaker that will ensure the speaker is big enough to have an effect on the tone.BatteriesThe size and quantity of the batteries that the radio takes will effect the tone!!  The bigger the size of battery the fuller the tone and the more volume the radio will have.  Try and find a radio which takes \"C\" or \"D\" batteries as these will give you the best result.  Radios which take a 9v or AA batteries won't give you the best sound.  It is definitely worth though experimenting and seeing what type of sound you can get out of the small \"transistor\" type radio's.

I'll go through how I wired this one up first and then let you know what I did on the second. Steps:1.  One of the wires needs to be soldered to a negative point on the radio.  The easiest place to solder the wire is on the negative terminal inside the battery case.  There's already solder there (you'll have to add more though) and it's easy to identify. 2.  So which wire on the input jack do you solder on to the negative terminal? Well on a jack the tip is the \"hot\" section meaning its positive and the side is the negative section.  In the pictures I have attached a yellow wire to the negative solder point on the jack.  Just solder the end of the wire to the negative battery terminal.3.  Now with your guitar plugged into the input jack, test each of the solder pads on the volume pot.  Place the wire on one, strum the guitar and if nothing happens try the next until you can hear the guitar come out of the radio.4.  solder the wire into place and your done with the wiring.Notes on my second attempt. On my second attempt on making one of these (documented inthe Youtube clip below) I messed-up the wiring.

I bet if you showed someone the radio after the hack they wouldn\u2019t even know what you did.In Australia it is quite hard to find real vintage radio\u2019s.  Virtually all of the second hand and thrift stores I visited had nothing.  My first was found down the tip and the second one was purchased at a small county op shop.  It seems that one brand really dominated in Australia in the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s and this was AWA.  Other brands like Silvertone or Motorola seem to have not really been distributed here.The US on the other hand has an abundance of very cool vintage radio\u2019s available.  A quick look on eBay  will show a huge variety available.  The great thing is, most are available to anyone in the world as long as they are willing to pay the shipment costs which can be more than the actual radio.For anyone interested in going further with their hacks or want more credible info then my ramblings, then check out the below websitesRadio-Guitar-AmpsCigar Box NationLonesoulsurfer", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FN5/HLBH/I0TVHWTW/FN5HLBHI0TVHWTW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVK/1KTR/I0TVHWTT/FVK1KTRI0TVHWTT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWP/B4KP/I0TVHWTZ/FWPB4KPI0TVHWTZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Notes."}], "channel": "No channel to show"}, {"category": "technology", "description": "The silicon transistor was invented in 1954 and has been considered one of the greatest inventions in the history of technology.  Its invention practically spawned the field of electronics and contributed to all of our modern computers, iPods, phones, etc.  If you've ever asked what a transistor is or does, you probably were told that it is like a switch.  However, it is a bit more complicated than that.This Instructable will detail a basic transistor and what it can be used for.  I am making this because I have had a box of assorted transistors for a while and never really knew how to use them in circuits.  After reading some tutorials online I combined some ideas together and figured out how to use transistors in basic circuits.I will demonstrate the use of transistors by controlling PC fans from a computer's LPT (parallel) port.  Then I will implement a simple form of PWM (pulse-width modulation) to control the fan's speed.  This demonstrates the ability of transistors to use low-voltage, low-current signal lines (such as a parallel port or microcontroller IO line) to control higher voltage, higher current devices like motors (in this case, PC fans).", "title": "A Simple Introduction to Transistors and PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation)", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/A-Simple-Introduction-to-Transistors-and-PWM-Puls/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "In this instructable I will be focusing on NPN transistors.  A transistor has three terminals: Base, Emitter, and Collector.  The base terminal is connected to the signal voltage, the collector is connected to the load, and the emitter is connected to negative (ground).  Whenever the base voltage is zero, the collector voltage is also zero.  Applying a small current to the base causes a proportionately larger current to flow through the collector.  By doing this, a tiny amount of current from a signal can be used to drive larger currents to power heavier loads such as relays and motors.Note that the load and the signaling devices must share a common ground.  In the case of a fan (running from an external power supply) and a computer's LPT port, you can connect the ground terminal of the power supply to the ground pin on the LPT port to achieve this.  For a microcontroller you can use the same ground for the chip and the load.For my examples I soldered three NPN transistors to a small PCB and wired all of the emitters together to form a common ground.  I did this to make connecting things easier.  In the following examples I am only using one of the transistors.  The other two are not affecting anything and can be disregarded entirely.  The transistors are \"MPS A06\" labeled.  According to the datasheet they can control up to 300mA and have a voltage limit at 80V.  On my PCB, the brown wires are common ground, blue is collector (load), and white is base (signal).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F7V/E9N1/FZQ1GEJE/F7VE9N1FZQ1GEJE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDP/Z4QL/FZQ1GEV1/FDPZ4QLFZQ1GEV1.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: How a Transistor Works"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "To generate the signal current for this experiment, I used the easiest thing that I already had access to.  Since I don't have any microcontrollers or other cool devices, I resorted to my old laptop's LPT port.  If you're using Windows you can try programs that are designed to flash LED's connected to the LPT port.  However, I wanted to have a little more control so I wrote a little program in C++.  I'm running Ubuntu Linux 9.04 on my laptop.  Windows has an annoying restriction that prevents programs from directly using the legacy ports (LPT and serial) and having to use drivers to get around it is confusing and annoying, so I just used Linux, where it is easy to access the LPT port if you have root access.The input and output functions are in a header called sys/io.h (some sites say asm/io.h, this is outdated and doesn't work in 9.04).  The function ioperm() gives you access to the LPT port and the function outb() outputs binary to the port.  The base address for the port is 0x378 and we are going to control all the outputs together, so writing a 255 to the port turns on all 8 output pins, writing a 0 turns them all off.  Other combinations involve converting the number to binary which isn't going to be described in this Instructable.Here is a sample program that will turn on the signal lines for 10 seconds and then turn them off.  Compile it with g++ in the form \"g++ lptfan.cpp -o lptfan.o\" replacing lptfan with whatever you save it as.//lpt controlled fan#include #include #define base 0x378using namespace std;int main(){ioperm(base,1,1);outb(255,base);sleep(10);outb(0,base);return 0;}", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FPV/RQ9X/FYTCM7GX/FPVRQ9XFYTCM7GX.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Programming for the Parallel Port"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Be careful!

I have the base (white wire) connected to pin 2 on the LPT port, the collector (blue wire) connected to the fan's negative wire, the fan's positive wire connected to the power supply's positive wire, the brown wire to one of the LPT port's ground pins, and the other brown wire to the power supply's negative wire.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FBZ/ZSG3/FYTCM79S/FBZZSG3FYTCM79S.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FT4/CNIL/FYTCM79R/FT4CNILFYTCM79R.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGY/AJW9/FYTCM79Q/FGYAJW9FYTCM79Q.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Connecting the Transistor, Fan, and Computer"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "After double checking your connections to make sure that the LPT port is connected ONLY to the base of the transistor and ground, you can plug in the transformer or turn on the power supply to the circuit.

The fan should stop if you remove the white signal wire from the LPT port.With everything connected, run the program you wrote in step 2.

Probably the most useful thing you can do at this point is write a PWM generator so that you can change the fan's speed.  For this example, I am going to use a percentage to change the speed.  For instance, inputting 10 percent makes the fan run at 10 percent speed and (if done right) approximately 10 percent of the input voltage.

This depends on the fan itself as well as the power supply.  You will probably notice that the fan makes a buzzing sound even if it is stopped.  This is because PWM uses high frequency pulses to create lower voltages and these pulses cause the coils in the motor to vibrate (similar to how speakers work) and produce sound.  Adding a small capacitor across the fan's positive and negative wires will reduce this buzzing sound because the capacitor absorbs and smooths the pulses.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F48/K17F/FYTCM7EJ/F48K17FFYTCM7EJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGV/C269/FYTCM7EZ/FGVC269FYTCM7EZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPD/7CLC/FYTCM7DX/FPD7CLCFYTCM7DX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F74/JAYM/FYTCM7E1/F74JAYMFYTCM7E1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4K/MQAA/FYTCM7FJ/F4KMQAAFYTCM7FJ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: "}], "channel": "Science"}, {"category": "technology", "description": "This was one of the first circuits that got me into making.

The transformer and resistor you're attached to won't present much of a load so the voltage will be higher than the wall wart is quoted for.

I used them because they had the highest resistance, which hinted at the highest ratio. This way, I could be fairly confident that the voltages formed on the other windings would be lower.\n\u00a0 Take note first of the exact voltage the wall wart is giving out. The transformer and resistor you're attached to won't present much of a load so the voltage will be higher than the wall wart is quoted for. In my case, the wall wart rated for 9vAC was giving out 10.27vAC.\n\u00a0 Let this be a lesson in transformers! They are not a load; they transform loads. This is why tube amps need to have a speaker plugged into them when turned on. A load must be presented to the output valves, or they trip over themselves.\u00a0 It's like expecting one more step at the top of a dark staircase; only several thousand times a second.\n\u00a0 With 10.27vAC on black-green I found 317.2mvAC on yellow-red. Blue-black/white had 2.273vAC and green/yellow-black/yellow had 1.760vAC.\u00a0 This confirmed that black-green had the highest ratio, which suggested that it was the primary winding.\u00a0\n\u00a0 I first turned my math to the yellow-red winding.\u00a0 An impedance ratio is the voltage ratio squared, or, (VoltageIn / VoltageOut)^2.\u00a0 10.27vAC (the voltage on one winding) divided by 0.3172vAC (the voltage on the other), squared, equals 1048.\u00a0 My goal is to hook it up to an 8 Ohm speaker-- so 8 Ohm times 1048 equals 8384 Ohms.\u00a0 This is a push-pull Output Transformer so each output tube will see half of that, or 4192 Ohms (we'll call it 4k2 Ohms).\u00a0 This is a pretty good load for most valves, with a bonus of having that red/yellow tap which would allow us a 4 Ohm load.\n\u00a0 If a 16 Ohm speaker was the goal, then the primary would have a 2k1 Ohm winding per tube, with the red/yellow tap offering an 8 Ohm speaker connection.\n\u00a0 The blue-black/white and green/yellow-black/yellow windings we'll keep in mind for feedback, or simply keep unconnected.\u00a0 With a typical speaker cabinet they offer loads far too low or too high to be feasible.\u00a0 For instance, with an 8 Ohm speaker on the blue - black/white winding we'd have a\u00a0 ~163 Ohm load for the valve.\n\u00a0 Most valves would have a hard time driving anything that low.\u00a0 It would be possible, but not without what I'd call unreasonable sacrifices--superfluous and complicated, etc.\u00a0 I won't be unkind tho-- it might have some interesting sounds to it, or allow an unusual valve-- please post what you find.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FH2/B68E/GHZ75DGT/FH2B68EGHZ75DGT.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Impedance Ratio on Output Transformer"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "The output transformer is a back of the envelope kind of formula, and a power transformer is even easier to work out.\u00a0 Just plug the known quantity (utility voltage, 120vAC in the US) into the voltage ratios we worked out (10.18 : 41.7 : 0.617 = 120 : 492 : 7.27).\nWith fullwave rectification we'd attach one high voltage secondary to each anode (492/2 = 246) giving us 344vDC (246*1.4 = 344), not counting losses like rectifier drop and any filtering.\nWe know that the heater voltage should be 6.3v, but here it is at 7.27v.\u00a0 A couple of things contribute to this: Using a low voltage wall wart on a possibly fluctuating wall outlet, testing with an old multimeter, and extrapolating upwards quite a bit with those divulged numbers would let some gremlins in.\u00a0 Finally, utility voltage in the US has been slowly creeping upwards.\u00a0 The transformer might be expecting a lower voltage.\nNo matter.\u00a0 There are plenty of ways to fix the heater supply once I know how it'll act in situ.\nI know now what wires go where and the approximate voltages.\u00a0 Looking at the amp the transformers came from I know the amp they will become could have a valve rectifier, two preamp valves and a low wattage push-pull power amp.\u00a0 I could reshuffle a bit, remove the valve rectifier to free up some heater current, or use lower-current power amp valves and and apply that to additional preamp valves--I'll go over some of that in future instructables.\nThis is the first step in a series on building a guitar tube amp from found transformers.

Ask to try out the basses, and they will try to talk you into a bass. Just ignore it, and try out any bass that looks good to you. What you should look for in a bass is whether you will be playing only rock, only jazz, or a little of each. If you only plan on playing rock, I suggest a precision bass, they have a deeper tone. A jazz bass is the opposite, it has a brighter tone. Personally, even though i play mostly rock I love my Jazz bass, it seems more... well... customizable. You will be able to tell the difference even if it is not in the name like Fender. A jazz bass has a narrow neck towards the tuning parts, but it gets wider towards the body of the bass, therefore the strings spread apart. A precision  bass is different in that the strings stay more or less the same length apart down the whole neck.When you are looking at basses, don't look at the price tag, that comes next. If you fell in love with a bass, tell the workers there why and they might have a cheaper version. Also, ask for someone who can play the bass, people who don't will not know much about a bass.Fretted over Fretless: For a first bass, get a fretted. They are easier and you can slap them and such. For a secondary bass get a fretless if you want. That does not mean don't try a fretless out, they are really fun to play.Full sized over 3/4: Get a full size, even if you are young. You will grow into it. It will also get your fingers used to reaching. 4 String over 5 or 6 string: For your first bass, get a 4 string. Until you feel you need another string (most of the time the string is lower) stay with a 4 string bass.24 Fret over 21 Fret: Actually don't worry about that. Any of the two will do. The 24th fret is just another octave.Active over Passive: Active electronics means you get better sound quality from your bass, mostly more bass. It also takes a battery. However, you can usually shut it off so you can play it like its passive if you want that sound.Solid over Semi-Hollow/Hollow: GET A SOLID! Although the hollow ones may look cool, once you crank up the volume the air inside will resonate giving it a muddy tone. Unless you are planning on always playing softly, get a solid bass.Of course, you can go against all those if you truley fall in love with a bass. Just i suggest you pass the bass with someone who plays the bass. They will hopefully tell you if they like it. Also, before you buy it, go to a different music store if you can and try a few basses there, and compare prices.Strings: Don't worry, unless you are really good at the bass you probably will not notice the difference.Some other tips: Unless you think you are good at the bass, I suggest you don't crank up the volume on the amp at the store, it is pretty embarrassing to have no idea what to do and just hit random notes, most people will know that you have no idea what you are doing.Looks are a lot in a bass, only try the basses out you like the looks of. It is no fun having an ugly bass.Get a hardcase, they are sturdier than softcases and more protective.Get an bass amp, not a guitar amp.Used basses ARE good, they will not lose sound quality. They may even gain it. You can also get a great deal on a used bass, I saved more then $500 on my Fender Jazz Bass, (the first picture in the intro)My suggested price ranges when you do end up buying a new bass:100-300-Beginner. Keep this bass for a few years until you get good and decide to stick with the bass300-500-Intermediate. Keep this bass for a while, until you feel the instrument is holding you back.Above-Good. The store just made some cash, and you have a bass thats really good. You probably don't need a bass that good until you are good.My suggested price ranges when you do end up buying a used bass:This is harder, but I suggest 300-500I got mine for 400, it's a $900 bass. I also got a really good deal on it though, they were having a sale.Amps: The bigger the better, don't get a used one. The more watts the more punch you will feel when you hit a note as well. As a beginner, you probably only need 20-30. As you get better, trade it in for a bigger amp. You really shouldn't need anything fancy in an amp, no effects or anything, however they are fun sometimes. You're bass should have enough knobs built in to get the sound you want. You could also look into tube amps, or even build one! Build a Tube AmpFor the case, depending on how good your bass is, any old hardcase will do, they range from 90 to a lot more. I got mine for $90Strings: Your bass will come with strings! Once you get good enough read the Strings step in this instructable.Also, get a tuner if your amp does not have one built in, and a cord.

If there is no curve at all, look for the manual for your bass. Make sure it is recommended to change that setting, and also where it is located. The rod is called the truss rodIf your bass still buzzes, you will see a place where the strings attach to the body of the bass. There will be a place to put an Allen wrench in.

Same as the 24th fret if you have it. They are usually marked with two dots in between the frets instead of one. If you have the 24th fret, between the 12th and 24th is just the same as the open string to the 12th. If you have 21 frets, it is just 3 frets away from that.Another way to get the octave is two strings over, two frets down.

An eighth note with the line connecting the two notes being hollow in the center is a 16th note, or 1/4 a beat.Two dots at the end of a measure means to repeat from the beginning/where a previous two dots facing the other way are.the44 means there are 4 beats in a measure, if it is34 there are 3 beats in a measure.C also means 4 beats in a measure. C means common, because 4 beats in a measure is common.A whole step means another note, for instance a whole step could be from G to A (on the E string). That is two frets in almost every occasion but the notes B C E F. They are only a half step, or 1 fret. For instance, from E to F you would have the open string, and then to get to F that is the first fret on the E string. That is why a G is 3 frets up from an E, there is a note in between. Remembering that, on your A string what is the first whole note you would hit? B. Notes go by the alphebet, A B C D E F G then they start over again.

Start playing around with the bass, finding all the sounds you can get from it. Remember, there is no right way to play, there is just your way.Third week-Warm up, practice the scales and walking bass lines, but start learning music. I suggest you start with sheet music and improve your bass clef reading skills. Keep messing around with the sounds. You could also buy a bass sheet music book for beginners. That will be useful.After that:-Just keep repeating, everything, working out your fingers. Once you feel that you need a greater challenge, start slapping and plucking the strings. Once you feel you can read bass clef very well, move on to tabs. Perhaps start a band! It is always alot more fun to play with a guitarist and drummer!Like I said before, always practice a lot, your skills will begin to shape into a bass player. Good luck and have fun!", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 11: How Much and What to Practice"}], "channel": "Audio"}, {"category": "technology", "description": "Background Information:\r\nFor starters, your car amplifier is meant to receive its voltage from a 12 volt DC source which is your car battery. Common households use approximately 120 volts AC. So you can see that we two problems. The first is that we need 12v and not 120v, if this was the only problem it wouldn't too hard to solve. However the real problem is that we need DC electricity instead of AC. So why not use a simple transformer, like a cheap laptop charger that supplies 12v DC?\r\nThe problem with using some type of transformer is not that it puts out 12v but its the amperage. A typical car amplifier requires anywhere from 10-30 amps. (You can check how much amperage you need by looking at the fuses usually located close to the inputs on your amplifier.) So if you were to use a simple transformer that delivered 12v DV, it would most likely work at very low volume but it would get destroyed by the power needs once the volume starts to get louder and the amplifier requires more amperage. So, do they make transfers at a high amperage at 12v DC?\r\nYes, but they are often very expensive, easily on the upwards of a few hundred bucks for a quality one. So what's the best solution thats also more economical?\r\nThe best solution is to convert a computer power supply (CPS) to work at 12v DC and deliver high amounts of amperage. This is the most effective and possibly also the simplest way to get your amplifier working at full capacity. The process isn't too complex, it would be beneficial to have some knowledge of basic electronics and circuitry, and also be able to solder.Tutorial:\r\nTo begin, first know how many amps your amplifier needs. Do this by looking online or checking the fuses on your amp. Ideally you would want to exceed the amperage on the fuse so that your not constantly working the CPS too hard. This is the one i used, its rated at 24 amps for the 12v output. (http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2475867&CatId=1078) Once you have your CPS, search the serial number with additional words such as pinout to locate your models pinout sheet. Its typically not too hard to find pinouts of a CPS. Once located, you want to find the pin that says something like \"PS_ON\" or \"PS_OK\", typically located on the \"Main Power Connector\" plug. Most of the time the wire will be green but I have seen a few that have been purple or other different colors (typically older power supplies don't use green). Once you've located that wire, connect it to any of the black ground wires. What this does is allows the CPS to turn on properly. So once you've connected these two wires, try to turn on your CPSband it should work.\r\nNow that you have your CPS working, unplug it and take the cover off. The orange wires usually supply 3.3v (good for wiring any LEDs if you want) and the red wires usually supply the 5v source, both in DC voltage of course. If your only using the CPS to power your amplifier, then trim all the orange and red wires. KEEP the Yellow and Black wires, those are the ones used to supply the voltage and ground the amplifier. Once down, group all the yellow and black together separately. I used zip ties so they weren't a mess.\r\nI STRESS that it is needed to wire all the yellow wires and all the black wires to the amplifier. When running this high of voltage, just one or a few wires going to the amp may work great at first but it will lead to problems. Think about the wire thats used to connect the amplifier to your car battery, those wires are thick. Its not only a strong fire hazard but also keeps the voltage flow more open and puts less stress on the amplifier by wiring them all together.\r\nNow you need to find a way to attach a bundle of wires to a small terminal on your amp. The best solution i found was to use a fork wire terminal for two reasons. (1) it makes a great connection. (2) it doesn't look sloppy. You can buy these at your local hardware store, automotive store and just about anywhere that has a hardware section. I would encourage you to solder the wires together into a bundle before crimping to terminal on. This ensures that every wire is connected and makes it hard to pull the wires out from the terminal. For extra precaution i heat shrinked the connection as well.\r\nAdditionally, you will want to bridge a wire from the 12v source on your amp to the \"REM\" or \"REMOTE\" terminal on your amplifier as well. This bridge allows the amplifier to turn on.\r\nSo connect the 12v, ground and REM wires to your amp and it should be good to turn on. Don't connect it to your subwoofer right away though.\r\nLastly, im sure you know how to connect your amplifier to your subwoofer but you need to know how to connect it to your stereo. This is a little complicated because of the amount of ohms your amplifier receives and the amount of ohms your stereo puts out. It almost all cases, your home stereo receiver will put out a 8ohm signal and your amplifier will require a 4ohm signal. This problemcan be easily solved by using the speaker level inputs on your car amplifier. Simply connect both channels of the speaker level inputs on your amplifier to just one pair of terminals on the back of your receiver. This splits one 8ohm signal into two even 4ohm signals for your amplifier. Double check your ohm ratings to be sure though.\r\nNow, give it a try.Additional Information:\r\nBe careful, electronics can be fragile in the right environment and you don't want to damage something and spend hours or maybe days trouble shooting or having to re-buy something. There's no shame in posting a comment if your unclear about something and need help.\r\nI have had offers to build the CPS unit already converted and ready to hook up. I have no problem doing this for a bit extra than what it costs for materials and shipping.

So I opted for this prototype version that would be about the same volume, but out of 1/2\" birch plywood.  After roughly measuring the location where the speakers needed to fit (using some tape and paper because I forgot my tape measure at home), I used the Makercase website to help me get started with a basic plan for a wood box.Using Adobe Illustrator, I edited the bottom to change the box joint seams to a clean base with just a piece of plywood that would sit inset the bottom.  I designed an internal frame with the same dimensions, but the whole center cut out, so it could be glued in place and leave a nice flat lip for the above shown screws to attach to, which wouldn't be visible from the outside when the speakers were sitting normally upright.  This is where I go in the box to install everything, and can get access later as I make changes.I cut all the pieces on a 130w CO2 laser cutter from 1/2\" 5ply birch plywood.

Having the USB charge ports right on the speakers assures the source of the music (my phone) isn't going to run out of juice unexpectedly either.I also lined the interior of the box with some synthetic insulation scraps I had left from another project.

I have a 2.1mm female power jack run to the exterior of the case from the internals, and I soldered together a cable to convert the XT60 connector on my balance charger to a 2.1mm power plug.  This isn't the best solution, since it doesn't keep the cells balanced, but rather shuts the pack off if they get too far out of whack.  I'll still open the case periodically to attach the XT60 connector and balance cable directly to my charger so I can see how quickly it loses balance.  In initial tests, it didn't seem to get out of balance any noticeable amount, but that could drift over time.In my next version, in addition to the external power input, I'll add a connection for the balance leads on the exterior.  I haven't found a good BMS board for the internal pack that provides the protection like the current one does, AND balances during charging.  I know they are out there, but I'm just new to building my own lithium packs, so feel free to suggest better options with URLs for buying for USA shipping.

At three dollars a pound I get to take home the shiny stuff. Exhibit A: three transformers taken from a tube amp of some sort. When reusing parts there are three useful circumstances to take note of:\nI: Model numbers of the amp you are dismantling:\nA: This lets you look up schematics. Just about any tube amp is halfway to being a guitar amp; usually fiddling with the gain structure will get you something musical so the chassis, sockets, and components can be reused.\nB: In this case the amp had at some point made someone feel sad and impulsive, so most of the chassis was no longer usable or recognizable. Remember kids: the gear's not the @#%#, you're the @#%#.\nII: Model number on the transformers:\nA: Lacking a schematic, one can always search for the transformers. The internet is just one big pile of information. And cat pictures . Even a scan of an eighty year-old electronics catalog could have the info you need. Why is there a scan of an eighty year-old electronics catalog online? Who knows? It's the internet.\nB: My Google-fu was no match for this iron. No matter: I have one final refuge.\nIII: What valves the chassis was populated with. This lets you know:\nA: Roughly how many watts the Output Transformer can handle\nB: How much heater current the Power Transformer can supply\nC: Roughly how much high voltage (B+) the Power Transformer can supply. Different configurations and biases will use up different amounts of current, but this should get you quite close. On Hi-Fis the Choke will likely be able to handle whatever B+ the Power Transformer can dish, but not always. For our little demonstration the Choke will be downstream of the output stage, so if they came from the same amp the Choke should be hardy enough.\nD: It can get complicated.

And the combination of 12AX7 and 6DG6GT tubes, though unusual, works quite well...\nOh, and this is a fairly hi-gain amp--i.e., it has a good amount of natural tube clipping and distortion, and a decently \"dirty\" sound. However, hi-gain and high volume are not the same....this amp is loud for it's wattage, but it's not a Marshall stack.

I wanted to retain the feel and budget of the radio-amateurs and home-builders of the past.

Although weaker than many common types (6V6, 6L6, etc.), nearly 80% of the output of a 6V6 can be achieved with a 50L6 (~4 watts for a 50L6 vs. 5 watts for a single-ended 6V6 tube.) And I have several spare 50L6's on hand... There's a long history of small practice amps with these tubes, yet they are generally ignored today.\nSecondly, this build has always intrigued me: Super SE 6V6, a parallel single-ended (two output tubes together in parallel) 6V6 amp. Perhaps the same approach would work with two 50L6's, probably wringing 7+ watts from the pair--that would be a true test of their suitablilty.... A parallel SE design would be a true Class A amp, too, with all the of the richness and aural mystique of the class (and more punch than my Kay.)Lucky Find\nThirdly, when gutting an old TV set I found a decent (and massive) power transformer appropriate for this build. A bit of explanation:\nThe 50L6 and it's variants (25L6, 12L6) are power pentodes with a maximum operating voltage of 200V. That's significantly lower voltage than most power tubes, which run at 300+ volts. Consequently, the majority of power transformers supply 250V or greater. A medium-voltage power tranny is actually tougher to find than the higher-voltage variety.\nThe TV transformer tested out with secondaries of ~140V and ~7V. AC voltage is RMS--essentially the average voltage for the wave form. Once it's rectified and filtered, it's higher. Depending on the rectifier, the DC output voltage will approach the \"peak voltage\" of the waveform. Immediately, I rejected the use of a tube rectifier--what I had on hand wouldn't be as efficient as a solid state rectifier. A 140V RMS transformer is nearly ideal. With luck, I could get very close to the 200V max using a SS bridge rectifier!\nSo finding the transformer first was the real motivating force behind the build...\nNext, I chose the preamp tube, a 12AX7. That was easy--they're the most common preamp tubes, and the majority of guitar amps include one or more. 12AX7 tubes pack two triodes into a single tube--double the fun.Enter the 6DG6GT as output tubes...\nSo I started planning how to supply the filament voltage for two 50V and one 12V (or 6V, the 12AX7 can be 6.3V filaments, also) tubes. A chance discussion with instructable member Ohm led to the 6DG6GT. While I was aware of the other variants, I hadn't heard of this one. Bravo, Ohm!\nSure enough, the 6DG6GT specs were identical to the 50L6, except for the 6.3V filaments. Now I could plan on three tubes that would run with 6V heaters, and the TV transformer included a 6.3V secondary...Well, I just HAD to build this! And I couldn't find any builds of this type (6DG6GT in parallel SE) on the web, at all. It couldn't be the first, but it looks pretty rare for guitar amps, anyway...", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F4K/7XHN/FHAVXU7Q/F4K7XHNFHAVXU7Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC7/JTNP/FHEJ02UM/FC7JTNPFHEJ02UM.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: How Did This Project Get Started?"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Availability\nIf we still wanted 50L6 tubes, they are fairly plentiful--lots of radios used these tubes. Same with 12AX7's, they're still being manufactured today and are plentiful (although not cheap.) I already had three for my Ampeg...\nBut choosing the 6DG6GT for a power tube was truly a pleasant surprise. The tube was standard in many TV sets, and they're cheap and easy to find. I bought 4 from ebay, at a cost of only $3.50 each! (shipping included!) Contrast that with 6V6's--good ones run $20+ per tube, minimum...\nAnd availability is always a concern. No point in building an amp if you can't buy any replacement tubes.\nThe 6DG6GT tubes are RCA NOS. The 12AX7 is a NOS Raytheon, which I \"borrowed\" from my Ampeg Gemini II amp (it needs work, anyway--a future project.)Heater Voltage and Current Requirements\nThe big concern with all 50L6 variants is the large amount of current required for the tube filaments.

I've tried to fix it the best I can...)\nBut if the 6DG6GT is to have the same electrical characteristics as the 50L6, the heaters must perform in a nearly identical fashion. The filament wire itself must be designed to compensate -- using more current, at the lower voltage:\nVolts X Amps == Power consumption\n50L6\t: 50V * .15A  = 7.5 watts \n6DG6GT\t: 6.3V * 1.2A = 7.56 watts \nObviously, the heater power requirements are practically identical; of course that follows since the electrical characteristics of the tube also match. But 2.4 amps (two 1.2A tubes, and not counting the preamp tube) is a fairly high amount of heater current @ 6V for a small amp...

Typically, they supply a range of voltages for different purposes--a current source for the output transformer, voltages for the preamp tube plates, and sometimes (in this case) a separate voltage for the pentode screens.\nUnlike regulated supplies, the different supply voltages are created with current-limiting resistors. These are often called \"voltage-dropping resistors,\" but their operation depends on the current draw of each stage. Designing a power supply\nThe first step is choosing the right power transformer (see the \"How did this project get started?\" section.) To pick the right transformer, look at the data sheets for the power tubes.\nThe 6DG6GT tubes have a max plate voltage of 200V. Theoretically, an AC RMS voltage is ~0.7 of the peak voltage, and the peak is approx 1.414 * the RMS. In practice it's lower--the transformer is under load, there are losses in the caps, etc. So something less than 1.4 is more realistic. (Gotta dig that crazy square root of 2...that 1.414 number pops up in so many places!)\nI'm not certain about the availability of PTs with secondaries in the 125-150V range. But maybe the 6DG6GT can handle somewhat more than 200V. Another alternative is to use a \"choke input\" power supply--that's connecting the choke FIRST, before any filtering cap. A choke input should drop the secondary voltage to 0.9 of the RMS (vs the 1.414 for a standard filter), so a 225V RMS AC secondary yields 202.5 VDC, also excellent. \nMy \"recycled\" transformer was ~140V (142) RMS AC, which, when rectified, (in an ideal world) becomes 200.788 peak (VDC)--perfect! (in practice--rectified, filtered and loaded, it's about 190V, still excellent.)  \nThe solid-state rectifying bridge was chosen over a tube rectifier to retain as much of that voltage as possible. That's OK--the much vaunted \"sag\" effect of tube amps doesn't apply to single-ended, Class A amps. They draw the same amount of current whether there's an input signal or not... Also, the PT doesn't have a centertap, so unless I used two tube rectifiers (or went with a half-wave design), solid-state was the best solution.\nThese voltages were needed by the circuitry:B.1  : 190V -- Max voltage for the power tube plates/output transformersB.2  : 180V -- A tap for the preamp tubes (Added during build)B.3  : 120V -- Screen voltage for the 6DG6GT power tubes (between 115-125V, depending on the data sheet)\nI did the initial design using an excellent (free) design tool: Duncan Amps PSUD2 Designer\nThe final result varied quite a bit from the simulation in PSU designer, however. That could be related to the unknown current-suppling potential of the TV transformer--but I'm beginning to suspect that the 6DG6GT screens draw much less current than noted noted on the data sheets... A Redesign Partway Through the Project...\nThe design evolved. Initially the first filter stage was an RC (Resistance-Capacitance) filter, but that changed quickly. To get a clean signal, I'd need to insert something like a 50 ohm, 20 watt resistor. But when I saw the amount of current wasted, I balked, and changed to an LC (Inductance-Capacitance) filter design.\nAlso a significant change--there was no B.2 supply at all, originally. I had planned that the preamp would run from the lower screen voltage (120V.) For the 12AX7, that's a pretty low operating voltage. So the preamp supply was added.The Inductor for the LC Filter\nIt helped that the gutted TV also included a (mighty big) inductor. It's an unknown value (inductors are measured in Henries), but it was matched with the TV power trannie, so I was sure it would work--and it did. And honestly, an LC filter does a much more efficient job of smoothing out the supply ripples in a single stage than an RC filter does.\nIncidentally, it was the addition of the the LC filter (pi filter) that prompted me to add the standby switch--the initial inductance spike exceeds the 200V max of the 6DG6GT's, by a fair amount. But during the testing phase the switch wasn't wired. There have been no negative consequences and I'm not sure the standby will be wired in. It's kind of silly, really--NOS tubes were often run at 150% of their rated voltage, so a short spike at startup wouldn't amount to much...\nAlso changed--originally, the preamp plate supply was slated to run on the same voltage as the screens. But it made sense to run the preamp at a higher voltage. So an additional RC stage (B.2) was added:Preamp Supply\nPreamp supply (B.2): As noted, this section was inserted AFTER the first version was built. I started with a 220 ohm resistor for the RC filter, but settled on a 1K value for a smoother supply. 1K didn't drop the voltage much at all (which had become obvious before when building the screen supply.) It would be nice to run the preamp tube directly off the B.1 supply, but preamps need something less noisy...Screen Supply\nScreen supply (B.3): Originally the second section of a two section PSU; in real operation it didn't match the Duncan PSUD2 software very closely. The simulator estimated the resistor for the last RC filter at 2.7K - 3.3K. But during the build the screen voltage was much too high--over 170V. with substitution, the eventual 15k value was chosen, which placed the screens at a nice 120V. A 20K resistor would probably work just as well... Surprisingly, the amp still functioned (poorly) with the initial high screen voltages, and the tubes weren't damaged. Vacuum tubes are amazingly forgiving of abuse...Misc\nThe PS voltage-dropping resistors are all 5 watt, although a 3 watt type would have been fine for the B.3 section (15k.) \nRegarding capacitance values, perhaps four 100uf caps are overkill, but they do the job. 100uF would be too high for a tube rectifier, but isn't a problem with the SS bridge.\nNo \"bleed resistor\" has been installed. One quirk of this amp--the PS caps seem to drain  through (cathodes to screens) the 6DG6GT tubes, possibly due to the very hot filaments. They keep the tube internals warm enough after power-down that the tube keeps functioning for a second or two. I don't know this for sure, but when I was experimenting with \"triode mode\" for the power tubes (screens not connected to main B.3), the caps were NOT draining.\nRegardless, ALWAYS check the filter caps before touching the internals.\nLike the whole build, the power supply's appearance is a bit inelegant, but it was modified several times during the project... Eventually it should be disassembled and reassembled in a sensible fashion.\nI've included a PDF on toroid transformer construction, for the adventurous...", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FMS/VTHX/FHEZC9KL/FMSVTHXFHEZC9KL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDO/OYJG/FHEJ15CM/FDOOYJGFHEJ15CM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6G/ESZ2/FHEZC7NL/F6GESZ2FHEZC7NL.LARGE.jpg", "/assets/img/pixel.png"], "step_title": "Step 6: The Power Supply"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "Unfortunately, the filament secondary for my power transformer isn't a separate winding, and doesn't have a center tap. Maybe I could disassemble the trannie and see if the coils could be separated...but it's a \"potted\" transformer (dipped in resin), and I didn't want to ruin it.\nThe trannie also powered about 12 tubes, and the filament voltage is ~7v, and doesn't drop enough under load to get near 6.3V (load isn't big enough.) In fact, one 12AX7 \"went nuclear\" and burned out (~$25 \"down the tubes\".)\nPlacing two large diodes in parallel but opposite directions in an AC supply limits the voltage by the voltage-drop amount (.5 to .7V), just the same as one diode in a DC supply. That dropped the filament voltage right to 6.3V, and the tubes were happy.\nThe two-diode trick works only for AC--current flows through one diode at a time, dropping that half of the waveform by the diode's voltage drop amount. One diode would do the trick for DC.Plan B\nHowever, they weren't quiet. You really need separate windings to setup a false center tap, which can be used to quiet the heaters.\nAfter trying various solutions, I decided to light just the power tubes with the main transformer, and use a cheap \"wallwart\" for the 12AX7 preamp. Now the preamp has it's own, \"dedicated,\" DC supply This was very quiet, indeed. The wallwart was already on hand.\nA ground reference (false center tap) was provided by bridging the 6V by a pair of 180 ohm resistors, tied to the chassis ground. It does make a difference.\nFor some power transformers, the required 2.7A @ 6.3V is a little much. Many are rated for 2.5A max. Of course, an extra 200 MA might be fine, depending on the transformer. But a separate DC supply for the preamp isn't a bad option. \nOK, this is a little, ehem, unconventional, perhaps even ghetto.

But I really did design it from scratch. If it sounds good, it will likely be similar to other designs, of course. There's nothing new under the sun for (simple) 12AX7 preamps.\nThis is a standard two-stage preamp. In theory, more stages equals a thicker, smoother type of distortion--without the \"hard\" breakup common to transistor circuits. Two stages is generally considered minimum for a \"modern\" preamp (some older amps had a single pentode preamp stage.) Of course, that's one advantage of the 12AX7--it's two triodes in a single tube.\nIt was modified, too, during building. As I raised the coupling cap values (from .01 to .02), the amount of gain, \"fatness\" and distortion increased dramatically. Most of the modifications since have involved REDUCING gain from the original design. I had very high gain settings initially, as the preamp tube was running with a lower voltage than most production amps. However, the extra gain was unnecessary.\nIn fact, I might still reduce some of the gain for the preamp stage...But the sound is pretty edgy for a small amp.\nOne starting point for preamp design is the data sheets. Most include a helpful chart (see first image.) With this chart alone, a very workable triode stage can be constructed.\nSome important concepts/components:\n--The Plate Resistor (Rp)\nVacuum tubes are controlled by voltage, but amplify current. To make them output a voltage change, we must add a plate resistor. Good old \"Ohms Law\": I*R=E (Current * Resistance = Voltage.) So a larger value plate resistor increases the amplification (you can verify this on the chart.)\nThe value of the plate resistor also has a profound effect on the amount of 2nd order harmonic distortion the amp produces. A tube amplifier has an inherent peak-to-peak asymmetry, which can be lessened or increased by varying the slope of the \"loadline.\" In preamp stages, the plate resistor determines the loadline slope. \n2nd order harmonic distortion is a positive--and is considered one of the characteristics of a good guitar tube amp.\n--The Cathode bias resistor (Rk)\nAll tubes require the grid (signal input) to be negative in respect to the cathode. A negative charged grid repels electrons, so no current flows. The simplest way to achieve this \"negative bias\" is to raise the cathode voltage sightly--that's the job of the cathode-bias resistor. Raising the cathode bias (increasing the resistance, or \"cold bias\") makes the grid more negative.\nTogether, these two resistors largely determine the gain (there are other considerations, also.) There are \"sweet spots\" for each, and poorly chosen, either the plate load or the bias resistors can result in some nasty (bad nasty) effects.Rules of thumb\nMore gain: increase Plate Resistor\nLess gain: decrease Plate Resistor \nMore harmonic content (2f): lower plate resistor\nLess harmonic content (2f): higher plate resistor\nThe effect the Cathode Bias Resistor has on gain is a little more subtle. There's a maximum gain sweet spot for bias, which may or may not be the desired sound. Both raising and lowering the bias will cause clipping, but in different ways. Some clipping is often a good thing in the context of guitar amps.\nAs a general rule, a higher (cooler) bias voltage results in a harsher distortion. The amplified signal is clipping hard against the \"rails\" (the supply voltage.)  But a hotter, lower bias can still clip. At this bias level, some clipping occurs (allegedly) due to \"grid current limiting,\" which is somewhat softer. However, there's usually a range between high and low bias extremes that results in the most \"natural\" amplified guitar sound.\nAlthough the rational for multi-stage preamps usually is that they create smoother distortion by only gently clipping in each stage, clearly another fundamental reason is that using lower plate resistors (lower gain) greatly increases the percentage of 2nd order distortion. More stages compensates for any gain losses. More components\n--Cathode Bypass Capacitor\nThis has a real effect on the overall output of the stage, and increasing capacitance will tend to boost the bass response.\n--Coupling capacitors (and the grid-leak resistors following which constitute an RC filter.)\nLabeled C and Rs, on the table below, together they have a huge effect on the frequency response of each stage.\nThe grid-leak resistors (in a cathode bias amp) are usually in the range of 220K - 470K. Oddly enough, the best-sounding value for the first stage was 120K. Surprising, since lower resistance here attenuates the signal somewhat. The specific frequency response overshadowed any signal loss. The second stage grid-leak resistor is a more typical 220K.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FDF/2W2C/FHLB1HK4/FDF2W2CFHLB1HK4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJP/R2NC/FHPVYHCF/FJPR2NCFHPVYHCF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5T/ORMI/FHPVYHCB/F5TORMIFHPVYHCB.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: The Preamp Stages"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "I intended to include a section here on using loadlines to design a preamp stage. I think I'll hold off, and keep it general.\nThere first preamp stage uses very typical guitar-amp values for the plate resistor and cathode resistor. Much of the tone is formed here.\nThe second preamp stage is \"goosed\" quite a bit. More conservative values might still be inserted here. This amp will feedback at some settings, and squeezes a fairly aggressive tone from only two preamp stages. Since it's controllable, I'm OK with that, for now.\nFor both preamp stages, smaller cathode bypass caps will shape the tone in a brighter direction.\nOne, or both of the coupling caps could be changed to 0.01 (vs. 0.02) for more treble.\n--On repeated playing, this amp is a little \"bottom heavy\"; yet it never gets muddy. It just doesn't have stinging highs, except from distortion. It's more a Marshall-ish rather than a Fender-ish sound (actually, it's really more Supro-ish or Magnatone-ish than Marshall...)\nBut note the input section. This is pretty typical wiring to create a input variation with only three resistors. The bottom input, which is a ground reference followed by a grid stopper resistor, has a more \"bassy\" sound. The top input jack uses the 56K resistor together with the other two to form a voltage divider, attenuating the signal. This is a a standard Fender-style \"pad\" input scheme. The divider input looses some \"omph,\" but seems to retain a bit more high-end.\nI rather prefer the Fender tone. At some time in the future, I might change the coupling and a couple of the bypass caps to enhance it....\nOr I might just leave it alone--jangly, harsh, high-treble amps are a dime-a-dozen. Might be fun to keep it as-is.Other Possible Mods\n--Rather than change any values on the the second preamp stage, a negative feedback loop could be added. This would tone down the \"ballsy-ness\" a bit.\nNegative feedback could also be adjustable.

Instead of a more conventional tone circuit, I chose to modify the \"Big Muff\" filter schematic instead. Why? For one thing, there's very little insertion loss with this tone circuit.\nOK--it's a little \"experimental,\" but that's good, right? \nI tried using the Duncanamps \"Tone Stack Calc\" designer, but it's useful as a starting point only. Simulations which yield nearly identical frequency responses sound VERY different when actually implemented. Lots of substituting caps, etc. was done before I was happy with it. And the \"presence\" pot was added after the simulation, since \"Tone Stack Calc\" doesn't let you change the circuit (just component values.)Download the Tone Stack Calculator here...\nConventional design would have replaced the caps with smaller values. I didn't feel the tone had quite the body as with these values. To be honest, there really isn't much treble, even with the tone control at max... but it's big fat tone, and kinda fun... \nThe 1M volume control mirrors a 1M fixed resistor in the \"Big Muff\" filter. There's probably some interaction with the tone settings.The \"Presence\" Control\nThe circuit is essentially a \"notch\" filter. I've set this up so that the notch is adjustable. The \"presence\" pot controls the depth of the notch, from maximum cut to almost a flat response.\nSince a large notch attenuates the signal, the maximum volume and punch comes from the flat setting. That's what I'm calling \"max presence.\" When the \"presence\" knob is turned down all the way, the volume is quite attenuated--because a large chunk of the sound was sliced from the middle! So there can be quite a bit of interaction with the volume control.\nThe 50K POT is a little large for this one. Substitute a 20K or 25K and it might be an improvement.HMMmmmm\nIf there's one part of this build worth replacing, it's probably the tone control. Other (more conventional) types would probably make the build sound more like a typical Fender (and reduce some of the thick tones.)\nThere's far too much interaction between the controls, too.

Without going into too much detail, Class A amps are considered to be the richest, warmest sounding type of audio amplifier. By their very nature, they tend to emphasize even-order harmonics, one reason why they sound so good.\n\"Single-ended\" means to drive the output transformer from one side only--contrasted with a \"Push-Pull\" configuration, in which power tubes are driving the transformer from both ends (with current flowing from a center tap.) Push-pull is more efficient, but is more complex--the audio signal supplied to one tube must have a twin \"mirrored,\" or inverted signal for the other tube. Hence the \"push-pull\" name. That requires a \"phase inverter\" stage, a necessary complication. \nAnd there are limitations to Class A. It's a bit harder to get max volume from a \"classic Class A\" design (single-ended, cathode bias, etc.) than a Class AB or Class B amp, however.\nOne way to increase volume, but keep the simple single-ended topology is to add a second tube in parallel with the first. Again, this isn't as loud as a two-tube PP setup, but it's simpler. It's also easier to keep a single-ended amp in \"Class A territory.\"\nHistorically, there are some commercial amps which used the parallel SE configuration--the Gibson GA9, and the \"Gibsonette,\" to name two. These, plus the Angela link (see: How did this project get started?) were inspirational.\nNote that the plates are simply connected together at the output transformer primary. It's that easy.\nGrid stopper resistors were added, simply because they are on the Angela project, and the old Gibson schematics, too. Although the Gibson plans usually had only one (I wonder if some additional asymmetry results?) Is the source of oscillation interaction between the two power tubes, so only one grid stopper is needed?\nThere's more cathode bypass capacitance that I normally care for. I wanted a pretty fat sound. I certainly got what I wished for.\nNote the cathode bypass cap switch. An attractive alternative: change the hard-wired caps from 40uF and 15uF to 10uF for each. Then switch in an extra 15uF on both with a DPST switch.\nThe cathode-bias resistors MUST be rated for 5 watts.Biasing\nThis is a standard cathode-biased Class A setup. My biasing voltage is slightly less (\"hot\" bias) than is noted on the datasheets. Here it's a 150 ohm bias resistor.\nThe datasheets recommend 180 ohm for 200V, although one datasheet used 160 ohms. We'll stick with 150 ohm for now. There's no sign of red plating or any other problems. If it lessens the life of the power tubes considerably, I'll change it to 180 ohms... Load Resistance Based on the Datasheet\nPower tubes have a characteristic called \"load resistance,\" which specifies a recommended  output transformer impedance. The load resistance is listed on the datasheet:\nVoltage of 6DG6GT : load resistance\n110V :  2000  (ohms)\n200V :  4000     (Again, sorry for the lost formatting.)\nWith B.1 voltage close to 190V, a load resistance around 3666 ohms is recommended. However, this value is for one tube. \nLoad resistance for two tubes is half the value of one, or about 1833 ohms. This is the theoretical value of the primary impedance for our output transformer. Note:this is a guesstimate, based on the datasheet. In the next step, we'll actually find the load resistance mathematically...Maximum Power Output\n(The load resistances discussed here are for one tube--since this project uses two, then 1/2 these values are equivalent within the circuit.)\nI originally estimated the power output from the datasheets as approx 7+ watts. But the example values in the datasheets are for polite amplifiers, where accurate sound fidelity is more important than volume. But guitar amps need distortion, so we push this one pretty hard.\nSo lets look at the load resistance vs. power output chart. The red line represents our load resistance, somewhere near 3500 ohms (remember, for two tubes, that's 1700 ohms.) Where the red line crosses the Po curve is our power output.\nFor a \"driven\" amp, the max output is close to 4.4 watts. In fact, any load resistance values between 2600 and 6000 ohms exceed 4 watts per tube. These values depend on a high p-p signal, a decent bias and a plate voltage of 200v.\nWe're at 190V, so it'll be slightly less than the chart. We don't really know the p-to-p output of the preamp stage, but the preamp is definitely hi-gain. And we are running the power stage with a \"hot\" bias.... \nWe'll never know for sure unless it's bench-tested, but I suspect this amp is running above 4 watts per tube, over 8 watts total.

Tube characteristics probably vary by AT LEAST that much, any of the three figures is fine.\nOK, first--I bought an 8 inch Weber 4 ohm speaker for the amp (although I wish I'd gotten at 10 instead.)\nImportant when choosing an output transformer: The speaker's impedance has a definite impact on the output transformer's impedance.  As you can see from the chart below, twice the speaker impedance (4 ohms to 8 ohms, for instance) will also double the input impedance for any transformer. As mentioned in the last step, the target primary impedance of the output transformer is 1711 ohms.\nIn fact, output transformers by themselves don't have a set impedance, but instead possess a turns ratio (10:1, 20:1, etc.) Rather, the impedance of the speaker(s) is reflected backwards from the secondary to the primary. It's that reflected impedance that actually forms the primary impedance.\nThis isn't an ideal value when searching for off-the-shelf guitar output transformers--they tend to be higher impedance. It's reasonable, however, and there are options. Bigger, higher-wattage amps will use \"iron\" with lower input impedance, but they are generally PP transformers.Some OT options for this project:\n1) --Hammond single-ended output transformers (125SE Series)\nThese are great transformer for SE amps, but don't have an official \"spec'ed\" input inpedance below 2500 ohms. But they have multi-tap output coils, and they could be wired for an appropriate value. For instance, connecting a 2500 ohm primary OT with an 8 ohm secondary to a 4 ohm speaker (halving the load) also halves the primary impedance--to 1250 ohms. Now, 1250 ohms is a little low for two tubes (but probably not for three ;-)...time to plan V2 of this project!)\nAlso, the transformers would be out-of-spec; a larger-wattage transformer would probably made it a safe choice. Still...\n2) --Edcor GXSE Series\nEdcor makes some great guitar amp transformers, many of which would be excellent for this project!\nThese are a nearly perfect match to our requirements:\nGXSE10-4-1.7K\u00a0 (10W\t1,700\t4 ohms)\nGXSE15-4-1.7K\u00a0 (15W\t1,700\t4 ohms)\n3) --Hammond \"universal\" SE/PP output transformers (125 Series)\nAlthough touted as having both SE and PP capabilities, perhaps not the best choice. Single-ended and Push-Pull transformers have other differences beside wire--the cores are different. This prevents SE transformers in Class A amps (which are always drawing current) from reaching saturation.\nThe Hammond universals have multiple output taps, so they have many different input impedances. And they come pretty close to our target value:------\n(Due to the fact that many formatting features at Instructables have been revoked for non-pro members, this text-based chart has been removed. It was unreadable. \nRefer to the Hammond chart in the images below.)\n------\nFor a 4 ohm speaker, either 2100 or 1500 ohms are close to the target of 1711 ohms.\nThe 125 series is supposed to be usable in both SE and PP configurations. But in reality, they couldn't possibly do both well. I expect it's the single-ended performance that suffers, since it's so easy to saturate an output trannie in SE mode. So, they aren't the best choice, but they are a choice...EDIT: Hammond no longer claims these are usable as SE transformers, and are now marketed as push-pull only...", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FPC/IWIG/FHEJ147E/FPCIWIGFHEJ147E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXP/Y0EQ/FHEJ147D/FXPY0EQFHEJ147D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7Z/XVDW/FHEJ1484/F7ZXVDWFHEJ1484.LARGE.gif"], "step_title": "Step 12: Output Transformer, Part 1"}, {"step": 13, "steps_text": "Ok, so I already had a Hammond 125C, which is an 8 watt, \"universal\" OT.\nMuch of the testing with this amp was done with the Hammond. But it's not ideal--it's better used in the push-pull configuration, especially this close to it's rating. Single-ended transformers generally reach core saturation quicker than PP OTs--SE (Class A) amps draw current throughout the operating cycle. That has a reactive effect on the inductor. consequently, SE and PP output transformers are designed slightly differently (so the validity of a \"universal\" OT is in the eye, er, ear of the beholder...)Technically, the 125C is big enough, since this amp is approximately 8 watts....but in practice this was not so... (Is this really less than 8 watts? Ignoring the \"typical\" example on the datasheet, the charts indicate that a single 6DG6GT can produce upto 4.4 watts..this is probably an 8 watt amp...)\nSome general notes about the Hammond 125C :\n--I tried both 1500 and 2100 ohm primaries. The lower impedance was definitely more musical, bluesy and overall the better tone. But the 2100 primary gave the amp a more gravelly, overdriven sound. Some might prefer it.\n--At both hookups, the Hammond OT was definitely getting warm. Not really hot, but I didn't play power chords for three hours straight, either. Probably too small for the amp, especially as a SE OT.\n--Since the transformer was right at it's limit, the core (over) saturation gave it a very \"Cream\" sounding distortion...unfortunately, chords and comping leads pushed it over the edge, and there was no definition, just muddy, nasty distortion. \nSo I sprung for the Edcor GXSE15-4-1.7K, with a 1700 ohm primary. This thing is MASSIVE compared to the Hammond; easily 3 or 4 times as heavy. The 10 watt version probably would have worked as well, but many people are putting Hammond 15 watters in \"Champ\" projects, and those are only 5 watts (vs. 7 or 8 for this one.)\nPlus, as noted on the previous page, 1700 ohms is an almost exact match to the theoretical output impedance of two 6DG6GT tubes at our supply voltage (yay!)\nThe Edcor has specified inputs for the B+ and Plate, as well as Screen (Not sure \"screen\" would work with the 6DG6GT's, but I already had the screen voltage tap on the power supply.) And there was a discernible tonal difference between the two secondary / speaker wiring options (swapping the order of the speaker wires.)\nAlso, the GXSE15-4-1.7K is too large to mount on the chassis, OR the speaker! But it fits fine in the cabinet. Doesn't seem to cause any noise issues.\nThe difference between the two transformers is marked! The amp now handles chords and multi-note leads just fine. Single notes are fat; the overall tone is warm and full. The Edcor was right choice....\nThe Edcor GXSE15-4-1.7K lists for $30 USD, and shipping was $9. The 10-watt version (GXSE10-4-1.7K) costs $10 less... Either price is very reasonable, for such excellent output transformers.  Find them at Edcor Class X Guitar Single-Ended Audio Output Transformers...\nSept. 2008\nNote: I've been using this amp almost daily for 4 months. The chassis gets a little hot. The power transformer gets a little hot....the Edcor output transformer is always as cool as cucumber.

If you're in the US, connect the primary to standard US 117V mains, and you've got a 150-0-150V secondary--perfect! However, any filament taps will be halved, so a separate 6V transformer is needed.-- Try a \"universal\" isolation transformer--one that has 117 and 230 primaries, and a 117 secondary.

I still switch to the internal speaker when I want to drive the amp to the edge of instability (feedback, etc.), but it's a more vintage sound with the cab.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FCG/UHUO/FHY0HDCB/FCGUHUOFHY0HDCB.LARGE.jpg", "/assets/img/pixel.png"], "step_title": "Step 23: Update, V0.2"}, {"step": 24, "steps_text": "Sept, 2008I continue to refine the amp. It's been several months since the initial build, and it's still going strong. Any concerns I had-- for instance the power tube cathode bias being too \"hot\"-- are gone... Here are the next round of changes (see the new schematic):(***there's another change I won't be adding to the schematic yet...we'll see if I like it first..***)1) Added a screen-grid stopper resistor to the ultra-linear tap of the output transformer. It's there to prevent too much current from frying the screen.It's added only in series with the tap, not with the main screen supply. The main supply already has the current dropping resistors in the power supply.If anything, it's addition has brightened and added gain to that option of the screen supply (there are two options available.)2) Removed the extra cathode bypass cap on the second power tube. It just didn't make a large difference.It's still not a bad idea--only have a double pole switch add / remove capacitance from both 6DG6GT's at the same time. That would make a noticeable difference. Maybe start with two 10uF, and switch in another pair of 30uF caps....3) Added an external speaker jack. I've been experimenting with two cabs.-- a 2X12 cab with two old CTS organ speakers (with the \"whizzer cones.\") It's an old bass cab.-- a 4x12 cab with two Eminence speakers (and the other two holes empty.)It's pretty freaking amazing how loud this amp is with a 2x12 cab. I literally can't hear myself shouting...Of the two cabs, the Eminence speakers have a harder, more aggressive sound. Which you would expect. What I didn't expect is how much I like the old CTS speakers--especially when the amp isn't cranked. It's hard to describe--but a very full, vintage sound that loves single-coil pickups....", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FNW/XLK6/FKLD2T7D/FNWXLK6FKLD2T7D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY6/VWU8/FLLZY4QT/FY6VWU8FLLZY4QT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR8/0FVG/FLLZY4QS/FR80FVGFLLZY4QS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRG/E6HY/FJ2W8LYV/FRGE6HYFJ2W8LYV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQM/FRWU/FJ2W8LYW/FQMFRWUFJ2W8LYW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 24: Update, V0.3"}, {"step": 25, "steps_text": "Late Sept., 2008While reading about the weird additions to the Fender Bassman (Ver AB165), I noticed a comment about a local Negative FeedBack loop on one of the gain stages. In theory, this should add some compression to the amp. NFB will also extend the frequency response of the amp.NOTE: Just so we're clear:Negative Feedback results in less of the high frequency feedback squeal usually associated with guitar amps (that's \"positive feedback.\") Negative is good, in this case.So I tried it on the second preamp stage. I really like it! Of course, a NFB (negative feedback) loop will subtract a bit of gain from the amp--hence it's \"optional\" nature.For a bit of a twist, I ran the feedback signal back through the tone stack. Note that the \"presence\" control still works with the NFB, but has less effect on the sound.Any value from 100K to 680K will probably yield results...pick one that suits you. Rule-of-thumb:the lower the resistance in the loop, the more feedback and the more signal loss. So lower values like100K will have more effect on the tone, but make the amp quieter and less overdriven. it's certain possible to have a switching option, also.NOTE:I did add a switch for the NFB loop, and it works great. Switched in, the sound is definitely sweet and lush. Switched out, the punchy, raw sound returns.The cab back photo shows the switch, along side the screen supply switch. The switch has now been reassigned for different uses--twice. Maybe a relay / footpedal setup in the future?", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWP/Q35C/FLJ5KU85/FWPQ35CFLJ5KU85.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1Z/00FB/FLJ5KU86/F1Z00FBFLJ5KU86.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY6/VWU8/FLLZY4QT/FY6VWU8FLLZY4QT.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 25: Local NFB Option, V0.4"}], "channel": "Electronics"}, {"category": "technology", "description": "This fairly simple instructable will show you how to make a simple guitar lead.\nP.S im only 13 so no bad comments please :)\nSo lets get started", "title": "How to Make a Guitar Lead", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-make-a-great-guitar-lead/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The equipment you need are\u00a0general.
