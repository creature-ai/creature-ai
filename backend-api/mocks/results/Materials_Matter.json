Think again! Powder coating is a great way to give a professional looking finish to metals and also to other surfaces that can safely be baked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. You may need to finesse the process to get the glass to take the powder, but once you do, it's worth it! In this Instructable, you'll learn how to powder coat a glass jar as a finished piece, or as a surface for laser etching, hand-painting or other techniques.

Then clean it with soapy water, and let it dry thoroughly.\nYou'll probably want to work with several (3-8?) pieces when you first start because there's a learning curve to the process and it also saves time to work in batches. Further, if you're going to LASER or paint your coated pieces later, you'll need extra pieces for test strips and continued runs. You DON'T need to work only with jars: any kind of glass should work as long as the foil will attract the powder through the glass and you can work with the pieces throughout the process of coating and moving in and out of the oven.\nWhat you'll need:\n> Several Glass pieces between 4\" and 20\" in diameter. (rough estimates. it just has to fit your machines and be movable.)\n> Hot soapy water and sponge or rag to clean materials.\n> Powder coating materials, supplies, equipment, including powder oven.\n> Heat resistant tape- Have about 5-30 feet for a project because you want to use it liberally.\n> Aluminum foil. have at least a quarter of a roll to a whole roll for each project just so you don't run out.\n> Conductive work-holding device, either hanging or resting, able to be transported to the oven and back.\n> Gloves to transport the hot materials\n> A clean rack or surface to cool the materials once out of the oven.\n> optional: Wrapping paper or something to transport your piece out of the shop after you've coated it.

the tool box choose the icon of a paint can tipping over.\u00a0 Set the color to white and try clicking on a color section where there is no black.\u00a0 By increasing the threshold you will increase the areas chosen to white out.\u00a0 I would bring it up to 125 for most areas, but where there is fair bit of detail you will have to scale it back a bit.\u00a0 If you white out to much just use the \u201cback\u201d button.Go back to your tool box and select the magic wand button, increase your threshold again click on the white sections.\u00a0 To select multiple areas hold the shift button down

Just go back with the wand and select these areas.\u00a0 You wont have to go through the step of adding the alpha channel again, just select and use the clear button.At this point you can save it and

frustrating!\u00a0 It has been covered in countless instructables regarding etching on metal using the ironing method.\u00a0 Regardless of what etching solution you use the process is the same.\u00a0 Sadly I don't really think my methods improve much on others methods other then perhaps I skip parts of the process they use.\u00a0 The biggest tip I can offer however may seem like a bit of redundancy and is learned from messing up this very instructable, it will be covered in step 6 once you have applied the toner to the metal.\u00a0 Always learning I guess.\u00a0\nChoosing your medium\n\t\tFind some \"cheap\" high gloss paper.\u00a0 This is actually trickier then it sounds as the whole point behind most high gloss papers is to provide a surface that produces excellent photo reproduction.\u00a0 So, its designed to absorb and hold the ink on the paper.\u00a0 In reality you are wanting a high gloss paper that does not absorb and or hold the ink.\u00a0 Now of course I am not really talking about ink at all, here we are using toner.\u00a0 But I digress, paper... I have tried a variety of papers with mixed results.\u00a0 All of the high end gloss photo papers worked somewhat ok.\u00a0 Sections of toner would transfer, but some sections no matter how much heat or pressure applied would transfer the toner.\u00a0 This resulted in splotchy transfers.\u00a0 I then tried using the coated paper found under sticker sheets.\u00a0 This worked well for the transfer, but the initial printing due to its ultra slickness left lateral tracking lines of toner.\u00a0 Lastly I tried something similar to magazine print.\u00a0 It was the cover sheet advertising loose leaf paper from staples.\u00a0 Found when you buy small packs of loose leaf paper, its the top colour sheet advertising staples brand paper that is vacuum sealed in the plastic pack.\u00a0 The only trouble is you get one sheet per pack.\u00a0 This is what I used for the photo.\u00a0 When I went through the process it left an icky white fuzz of dissolved paper, later I discovered this actually a good thing.\u00a0 I used another brand for the Daves name.\u00a0 The toner transferred awesome and left no paper residue.\u00a0 i thought it would turn out even better, boy was I wrong.\u00a0 The additional paper helped resist the etching solution.\u00a0 Suffice to say the photos pure black sections are ultra smooth.\u00a0 Where as Dave's name is actually quite mottled.\u00a0 Of course most people think this is intentional and I let them think that...\n\t\tThe kind of toner used varies just as much as the paper.\u00a0 I have found the best toner is always just the old school black kind found in old photocopiers.\u00a0 I have a colour laser printer at work that prints beautifully and transfers toner well for the ironing method.\u00a0 But it doesn't resist the etching solution all that well.\u00a0 Unfortunately i discovered this while doing this very instructable.\u00a0 Both the photo and the wording degraded more then I liked.\u00a0 If this is the only toner you have available, limit your time in the dip tank later on, and or check it often = which is what I should have done - doh!\u00a0 In my initial etch of the tattoo pedal I used toner printed from a old photo copier found at my local Shoppers Drug mart.\u00a0 It was looked and felt layered on, this is what you want.\u00a0 The script on the tattoo plate held up amazingly well, to actually feel the depth of the etch just can be expressed in a photo.\u00a0 Anyway enough prattle, lets begin.\n\t\tInsert paper into printing machine of choice\n\t\tSend image to printing machine, ensuring it is a reverse image\n\t\tRetrieve image and look for irregularities in the print job\n\t\tRepeat at nausea.... Why?\u00a0 I don't care if you are new to this or have done it a hundred times, errors will occur.\u00a0 It is much better to have a couple extra sheets lying around if the first one magically goes on perfectly, then to have to go back in the middle of the game to print out more sheets.\n\t\tAt this point your tonerized is susceptible to smearing, treat it gently.\u00a0 Of course this make the next step tricky, but worth it.\u00a0 Flip your image over and lightly trace in PENCIL the perimeter of the image.\u00a0 You will use this tracing when you line up the image on you plate as the toner will be facing down.\u00a0 You will not regret this step!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2Y/04RU/GWF6EK2J/F2Y04RUGWF6EK2J.LARGE.jpg",

is nice and smooth and your ready to apply the toner?\u00a0 Lets get started\n\n\t\tHeat up your iron, I set mine between cotton and linen - ensure you are not using steam.\u00a0 If your iron doesn't let you turn off steam, make sure to drain it first of any water\n\t\tlay out a towel on your work surface\n\t\tlay your plate on the towel - the towel helps the plate from moving around\n\t\tCarefully lay your image toner side down on the plate, lining up the image where you want it.\u00a0 Aren't you thankful you traced in pencil on the backside now?\n\t\tOthers usually put something over the image at this point.\u00a0 I don't bother.\u00a0 Just lay your iron over the image gently, try not to move your image.\u00a0 Let the iron just sit there for 4-5 minutes.\u00a0 This will cause some of the toner to stick to the plate effectively gluing it on.\u00a0 Gently begin to move the iron all over the image in lazy circles for several minutes with light pressure.\n\t\tNow increase the pressure moving laterally back and forth and side to side for several minutes,\u00a0 Always keeping mind you could shift the paper which is not good!\u00a0 Doesn't hurt to hold down the edge of the paper with a gloved hand to keep it from shifting.\u00a0 Your essentially burnished at this point, soon you will begin to see your image through the paper, but not always.\n\t\tIts patience time.\u00a0 Turn off your iron and walk away for 1/2 hour to let it cool.\u00a0 Do not plunge it into cold water to speed up the cooling process.\u00a0 You can develop steam jackets that can lift your toner you just worked so hard to apply right off the plate.\n\t\tOnce its cool enough to handle comfortably toss it in a bucket/sink of room temperature water.\u00a0 Resist the urge to use hot water to speed it up.\u00a0 Once again, walk away for 1/2 hour.\n\t\tBy now your paper should be nice and soggy but dont just try to peel the whole paper off.\u00a0 Instead using just your finger tips rub the paper.\u00a0 After a minute or so, the paper should begin to ball up under your fingers.\u00a0 Keep going, abrading the paper on with your finger tips.\u00a0 After 5 minutes or so the paper should be disintegrated and your image now right side up will be revealed.\u00a0 It will most likely be nice and dark with the odd speck missing.\u00a0 Those missing speck can be touched up easily enough with some paint.\u00a0 however if large portions are missing or lots if intricate detail will have to be painted on, I hate to say you may have to start over.\u00a0 Re-sand and start

though.\u00a0 You can use a variety of touch up methods at this point.\nOptionsIron another image.\u00a0 I decided to iron on the picture first, then go back and apply my lettering.\u00a0 In the pictures you will notice the image and the words are of a different colour, this is because I used a different kind of paper that left no fuzz.\u00a0 In theory you could iron in small sections as well, though I think this may prove problematic.\u00a0Paint.\u00a0 This is the method of choice for touch ups, in addition to reinforcing your toner.\u00a0 This is what i should have done for the image and Dave's name.\u00a0 It is what I did on the tattoo pedal, and the results were clear at the end.\u00a0 Now you may ask yourself if this is redundant, or why bother using toner at all?\u00a0 Well, if you are that good of a painter be my guest.\u00a0 Myself, I have found over the years I have fell out of practice of painting free hand with any level of quality.\u00a0 However painting over the existing black toner is simple with a nice thin enamel and a quality fine tipped paint brush.\u00a0 You can use model paint or even nail polish just as long as it is an enamel paint that has been thinned a little.\u00a0 Model paint and nail polish especially are to thick to paint with any fine detail.\u00a0 So paint in any missing parts and while your at it, go over your toner sections as well.\n\t\tWax or Vinyl.\u00a0 I have seen others paint on wax or even use sections of sticky vinyl cut out and applied.\u00a0 I really can't judge it as I have not tried it.\u00a0 I don't know if I would use though as the solution literally boils with a exothermic reaction.\u00a0 Quite a bit of heat is generated so it has the potentially to melt off the wax or break down the glues holding the vinyl on.\nLastly, perhaps you have a section of toner applied that now you wish you hadn't.\u00a0 No problem.\u00a0 Either use a small file, you own nail or even a small piece of sand paper to scratch off the toner.\u00a0 Don't worry if you muck up the plate with scratches as that whole section will be eaten smooth later on in the dip process.\n        ", "step_imgs":

cast effect that can only be appreciated in real life, pictures just don't do it justice.\u00a0 But each to his own.\u00a0 Either way you will have to apply paint to the edge of the metal and the entire backside of the plate to protect it from being eaten away.\u00a0 In theory you could apply the frame using the toner method, but that seems like a lot of extra work that take minutes with paint, and you would still need to paint the edges at least.\u00a0 I found the easiest method was to have my plate raised on something that would allow my fingers the space to grab the plate from top and bottom of the middle to flip it after.\u00a0 First I painted the frame.\u00a0 The carefully flipped it over resting it on the middle of the plate.\u00a0 Then i painted the edges and

pedal\n\t\tMuriatic acid all though not the strongest acid out there should be treated with respect.\u00a0 When I bought it, it came in a 1.5 litre bottle that was wrapped in a second layer in the form of a heat sealed plastic bag.\u00a0 I decided to open the bag with just bare hands thinking it was all sealed.\u00a0 Whoops, a tiny trace amount of the acid got on the side of my thumb and I immediately felt it going to work.\u00a0 The pain was incredible as it quickly dissolved a few milometers of my epidermis about the size of a pencil eraser head, with odd looking striations edging out from the initial wound.\u00a0 The wound took about a week to heal and hurt almost the whole time.\u00a0 USE SAFETY GEAR!!!, just imagine what that would have done to my eyes - very scary shit indeed - sorry for the potty mouth\n\t\tMistake No.2 - When you mix up your chemicals, never walk away from it.\u00a0 I mixed my solution, dropped in my plate and watched as nothing much happened.\u00a0 Sure, some little bubbles started to form on the bare aluminum and rise up like weak club soda, but not the reaction I was looking for.\u00a0 I was expecting a flurry of activity where none was taking place, so I left the detached garage where I was working and went back inside to look at the formula thinking I had done something wrong.\u00a0 I thought at this rate it will take hours! That's when I read the exothermic reaction takes a minute or two get started.\u00a0 It hadn't been 5 minutes when I walked back out side and promptly heard a continuous whooshing sound coming from the garage, and noticed a copious amount of yellow tinged gas streaming out of the open garage door - which leads to my next mistake.\n\t\tMistake No.3 - When someone says to do a certain type of work with plenty of ventilation, really you should be doing it outside! Not in a small shed with one small door open as your source of ventilation.\u00a0\u00a0 I was lucky as I had taken my full face gas mask with me inside.\u00a0 I used to work in a paper mill where you are exposed to all sorts of lethal gases.\u00a0 I ran into the garage, plucked the way to shallow tub of boiling acid up with some tongs and took it outside where I promptly dumped a bucket full of snow in it to dilute the reaction.\u00a0 After much cleanup and fanning out of my garage the dangers were over.Aside from that, etching the family portrait went off with out a hitch!\n\t\tEnsure your tub is wide enough to just hold your plate laying down, but ensure it is at least 5 inches deep to contain splashing boiling acid!\n\t\tPlan where you are going to do the dip, the chemicals when mixed produce toxic fumes but its when you introduce the aluminum that the real nasty gases are produced.\u00a0 Make sure your area is extremely well ventilated - ideal is outside, which is where I did it.\u00a0 This time...\n\t\tGet your safety gear on prior to starting, its not going to help you when you are on the ground with your melting out of your sockets and your lungs have withered away like deflated balloons!\u00a0 At the absolute minimum be wearing splash goggles and rubber gloves.\u00a0 Really though, a full face gas mask with appropriate filters is best.\u00a0 Your face is protected, and you can breath still - breathing, that's a nice perk\n\t\tOnce you are all Darth Vader-ed up you can mix your chemicals.\u00a0 The ratio is 2 parts 3% Hydrogen peroxide to 1 part muriatic acid - in that order!\u00a0 Never add the peroxide to the acid as it can cause an unstable reaction", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F03/AR4U/GWF5U4BI/F03AR4UGWF5U4BI.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Mix"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "\n          Ready to dip your plate?HEY, WHY NO PHOTOS OF THIS STEP?

times to flush off the acid.\u00a0 Check your progress, the toner and or paint will still be present but the exposed aluminum should now be etched away evenly and will look dull grey.\u00a0 If you

(You can mess around with bottles of different sizes).  Then fill about one-sixth of the bottle with Hydrogen Peroxide.  Then, take a pinch of Potassium Permanganate and add it to the Peroxide.  The moment you put the crystals in the bottle, you closed the cap of the bottle and screw it tightly. (This takes a longer time to read than actually doing it). MUST BE DONE EXTREMELY FAST. AVOID ANY TIME LAG.  The moment you close the lid, give the bottle a shake. An intense reaction between the two will occur:   Reaction: KMnO4 + H2O2  --> K2O2 + MnO2 + H2O + O2 (unbalanced) The H2O and O2 released in the bottle will increase the pressure because the volume remaining constant, the moles keep on increasing.  After that, you'll see that the bottle has stiffened up to its fullest. If you've taken a tough bottle, don't worry, it won't burst. Keep the bottle on the ground.  Now, with your left foot, pin the middle of the bottle to the ground. Place your right foot on the neck of the bottle.  With a sharp pull, pull your right leg towards yourself, in order to open the bottle with your foot.Now, with a BANG!, at a supersonic speed, the bottle cap will hurl ahead!

First of all, let me adress the fact that this, like most coloured fires, involves some chemicals that are not very good for the enviroment. So only small quantities were used (and only small quantities are needed, it's quite strong stuff) That said the substances used are not th\u00e1t dangerous or poisonous. More like a 'maybe-you-should-wear-gloves' or a 'try-not-to-get-it-in-your-eyes' kind of poisonous. The main problem is that they are quite corrosive. (see later) I know green fire has been done before, but mostly with Heet and Boric acid. Not much people have used Copper Chloride. Besides, it is mainly blue fire (see last step). This instructable is mainly a response to The Green Gentleman's\u00a0\u00a0 'Spirit Lantern'\u00a0 since it provides an alternative fuel that doesn't produce the white smoke that settles onto everything. I made the candle with a test tube so it fits in a candle holder, but of course it can be used in his lantern. However, the main additives and combustion products are a bit corrosive and that perhaps requires some modifications. And perhapse also a response to The Real Elliot 's 'Better etching solution' instructable since this is the etching method I used. However it is not a way of getting rid of the waste. Since I used very, very small quantities. Besides some complications and restrictions because of the corrosivity it is pretty basic and the result is a nice colourful flame.", "title": "Etching Waste Green/blue Candle", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Etching-waste-greenblue-candle/", "section": "workshop", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "This is a list of all things used for the candle.

And some Cu, but most of that stays on the wick. Yes, these are a bit corrosive but in small quantities they don't do very much. Don't burn this candle in a small room or area. Also, those CuCl , CuCl2 like attacking other metals. Try to avoid contact from e.g. Iron with the solution. Also keep it away from alluminium it just gets eaten. Just type it in google, it is quite interesting stuff. Basicly think 'fungicide' for the copper compounds (because they are (sort of) ) and treat them as a 'cide' and you'll be fine. HCl is HCl, just don't breath that in too much.\u00a0 (think puke, it smells anyway) HOCl look at wikipedia, it pretty much decays into H2O andn Cl2\u00a0 Just don't breath that in too.

The way Mr Real Elliot explained it, because this in way is that you can produce it in small quantities which is great for just trying it out. (the Ferrous Chloride comes in bags of 2 kg in a shop nearby) It never really worked for me because I probably did something wrong with the photoresist. But this copper chloride is very potent stuff. It just ate away all the copper. But anyway. After that, it was just standing there for a long time. And I once read that Copper(I) Chloride (the reacted product of this etchant) was used as a pyrotechnic colorant, so I had to try it out. I kept adding copper wire in order to maximise the amount of Copper(I)Chloride. But the etchant was constantly regenerating (to Copper(II)Chloride)\u00a0 with the atmosphere and the copper slowly kept dissolving. (It is actually very surprising how much copper ~2 dL of this stuff could eat. ) The liquid became very heavy and blue. I dried some of it, and in fact yes, a sniff of those crystals onto a fire turns the fire into a bright blue. Then later I saw The Green Gentleman's candle and thought, this blue fire would fit well inside this lantern.\u00a0 So basicly what you have to do for this is to follow Mr Real Elliot's instructions (for a small amount of liquid a couple of tens of cL is perhaps enough) keep adding more and more copper till it takes days to dissolve. Keep the lid open so it can regenerate with oxygen from the atmosphere. Perhaps keep it outside because some of the HCL likes to evaporate and it smells.\u00a0 (in my case a lot of snow fell in, so it was somewhat dilluted) The solution should be thick, blue and heavy. It now should be a mixture of dissolved Copper(II)Chloride and Copper(I)Chloride. I don't think it is possible or easy to turn all of it in Copper(I) Chloride. \u00a0 There also will be impurities due to other metals depending on the the copper alloys you have used and of course the amount of bugs that managed to get in.\u00a0 So this is in no way a precise project. Then simply evaporate it out and collect the crystals. (see the pictures) But know this isn't the most pedagogical substance because it constantly changes colour depending on the concentration in the liquid or amount of moisture in the crystals.\u00a0 It ranges from blue green, yellowish green to brown in it's dehydrated form. Pure Copper(I)Chloride should be colourless. Also, notice that I placed a copper wire inside of the liquid this was an effort to again minimise the amount of Copper(II)Chloride. Again with all the contact to the air the liquid regenerated a bit again and started eating the wire.\u00a0 However it was only a very small amount yet it is visually very dramatic since it turns the liquid very dark brown.\u00a0 This doesn't do anything with the substance, they will turn green later on. This evaporated out in the sun on the roof and the sides touching the hot black metal were so hot they dehydrated and became brown. This brown has nothing to do with the previous brown.\u00a0 After a couple of minutes inside they were green again. The end result should be bright blue /green crystals.\u00a0 (Ideally it should be colourless) Again, the pictures show way too large quantities! Only a very small fraction of this is needed.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F21/QH5O/HIW83RUN/F21QH5OHIW83RUN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJK/K54Q/HIW896W3/FJKK54QHIW896W3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLA/AYXT/HIWOQC1E/FLAAYXTHIWOQC1E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVC/IOJW/HIW8MVT2/FVCIOJWHIW8MVT2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9V/S0QO/HIW896W4/F9VS0QOHIW896W4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVY/OIDY/HIWOUFEC/FVYOIDYHIWOUFEC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNH/ZRBP/HIWDJVGX/FNHZRBPHIWDJVGX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEU/4H5P/HIW8MVT8/FEU4H5PHIW8MVT8.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: The Copper Chloride"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "As mentioned in the part list, the holder of the liquid is just a glass test tube. I don't know if it is a real one out of pyrex. It just came with some advertisment (I don't know about what anymore). But anyway, this tube is the most convenient small glass flask available. The small jars are occupied. As you can see, the tube is sealed with a cork which is pretty useless and it does not have a screw-on cap. So, some sort of cap is required to hold a wick. For this cap the lid of a pickeled onion jar is used. A square is cut out of the middle. Onto this square the test tube is placed and with a pencil the contours of the tube are traced. A Union-Jack-ish pattern is added, these will be the extensions grabbing on to the tube preventing the cap from sliding off easily. I did not measure anything, perhaps it would look a bit tidier but I mainly wanted to test this out. The pattern is cut out with tin snips and the extensions are trimmed to an equal size. The corners of those extensions are trimmed because they will be bent inwards so they won't be in each other's way. The sides are filed off a bit to reduce the sharpness and serratedness.\u00a0 Then the red and grey paint coating is removed with some sand paper exposing the bare metal.\u00a0 (But maybe it isn't a bad Idea to leave it on, because of the corrosiveness of the CuCl) The tips of the extensions are bent inward a bit. After that, the complete extensions are bent in so that they look like arms that grab on the test tube. Notice that this isn't airtight. Surely a flask with a screw on cap is way better.

The test tube is a container for a flammable liquid (in this case 85% alcohol, there are probably better substances). The flammable liquid travels up the wick by capillary action. Where it then is exposed to the flame and air. A hole is cut in the cap trough which the wick will be inserted.\u00a0 The hole is made using an old, dull (already broken) X-acto knife and a nail because I don't have a drill and it is the easiest way to cut trough the cap without damaging the extensions. The first thing I tried was simply putting a wick trough that hole and lighting it. This had two problems. First I tried it with the 85% alcohol and the fire was too wild. The cap heated up which evaporated more alcohol resulting in a bigger flame. This was not good for a candle. Then I added some water with dissolved Copper Chloride.\u00a0 Hoping this would result in a cooler flame which it did. However, it was per haps too much water because the wick barely lit anymore. The second problem was severe corrosion of the iron cap where there was contact with the wick.\u00a0 Namely the iron was reacting and replacing copper in the solution. So, it is clear that this would not work. So, the flame must be removed at bit from the container containing all the alcohol AND contact from iron with the wik must be reduced. The solution was putting a copper tube trough the cap trough which the wick went.\u00a0 The tube extends a bit thus increasing the distance of the flame. Secondly since it is copper, it barely interacts with the solution in the wick. (And if it does, it doesn't matter). However, since I did not find a copper tube this small, some coppr wire was wound up around the nail. 9 turns. The hole in the cap is increased so that the copper spiral just fits.\u00a0 1-2 turns are inserted into the cap, the rest stick out. Try to do this as precise as possible. As a wick, a piece of cotton cloth is used from about 2 x 6 cm.\u00a0 In one end, this wick is wound up tightly and pushed trough the copper spiral tube. The other end is wound loosely around the other non- trimmed end of the copper wire so it can fastly be inserted into the test tube. A small amount of copper chloride powder is put in the tube, some water is added.\u00a0 (how much depends on the flame you want, but I don't know what's the best ratio alcohol/Water/Copper Chloride. ) Put some Copper chloride powder on the tip of the wick, it helps. Then add some alcohol, put on the cap, wait till the fluid reaches the top and then light it. Problem! It still is not stable enough, the main problem is perhaps the non-air tightness of the cap.\u00a0 And the copper spiral. The flame still likes to creep down slowly along the spiral.\u00a0 This increases the size of the flame till it is a bit unconfortably large. The solution is to close the gaps.\u00a0 I have simply put a nut around the copper spiral and it worked great. After playing and moisturizing the wick with alchohol, the flame stayed stable and of a constant size till only about 20% fuel was left.

(Note that if you're building effects for Burning Man, the emergency shut-off valve is a requirement.)If you want to get fancy, you can use an adjustable LP regulator and experiment with different pressures.  For this, having a pressure gauge helps, so you can see what pressure you're dialing up.Safety tips:Wrap all connections in yellow teflon tape or pipe dope to prevent leaks.

Note that you probably actually want to avoid using galvanized pipe, as zinc is pretty toxic when it's heated.  But, for small prototype projects, it's not going to kill you in the short term, if used outside.  (However, never weld galvanized pipe.  Welding gives off a lot of gas and particulate.)A drill press or upright mill will allow you to do this with great precision, but it's hardly necessary.  For this project, we'll use a cordless drill and a 1/16\" carbide bit.  You can use larger sizes, which will create differing flame effects.Start by marking out where you want to drill at 1/4\" to 1/2\" spacing, and then drilling a quick divot with a center bit.  This is critical for using small-diameter drill bits.Next, use your 1/16\" bit to drill the holes.  The key to drilling steel by hand with a 1/16\" bit (or with a drill press for that matter) is patience.  Drill at low speed, and apply very little force.  Use cutting oil if you have it.  If you drill too fast, or apply too much force, you can easily bend and break the bit.  A good indicator that you're drilling at the right speed is that you're getting nice long chips.

The hose should have a 3/8\" male flare fitting.  Flare fittings are great because they're self-sealing and don't require any teflon.  We need a couple of adapters to attach this to our effect.  See the image for details.The gas in the effect is actually at atmospheric pressure, because it's venting through the holes, by design.  As such, teflon on the fittings isn't actually required.  But it's good practice to teflon wrap all your connections.  Tips for teflon wrapping the joints:Use plenty of tape, 3 - 4\" per connection.  It should wrap around a couple of times at least.Wrap the tape against the direction of rotation of the male part.  In other words, think about the direction you'll be rotating the male part to screw it in, and wrap the teflon in the opposite direction, so that when you're done wrapping the \"tail\" of the tape is pointing away from the direction of the rotation.  This will ensure that when you start screwing it in, the tape will tighten with the threads, instead of being loosened by them.Wrap the tape with about 1/8\" overlapping the end of the joint, and smooth it out with your fingers a bit before screwing in the joint.If you've done it properly, you can screw in the joints hand tight and not have an leaks.Once you're done assembling the effect, wrap it in steel wool, and tie it around with wire.

Steps:1.        As mentioned previously, all of these alarms have a test switch.  Usually these are quite basic.  Mine worked by making a connection with the ionization chamber.  As I had removed this I had to come up with another way.   The best way to figure out which solder mounts will turn your smoke detector on and off is to do some testing.  Start with the test on/off switch.  Touch a wire to this and any part that the ionization chamber was connected to.  Does it turn on and off when you remove the wire?  If so, you can just use this as your switch.  Unfortunately mine didn\u2019t so I had to do some experimentation.2.       With a piece of wire, I connected different parts of the circuit board to see what would turn on and off the fire alarm.  Below is how I did mine but as I mentioned previously, you probably have a different one to me so experiment until you come up with a way.  It took me about 5 minutes to work out one and it isn\u2019t hard.  3.  So what I did was attach a wire from the solder mount of the test switch to one of the legs on the IC.  there was a hole in the circuit board where one of the legs from the IC was sticking out.  that was the one I soldered the wire to. 4.

Keep in mind that, while we can purify by distillation with a simple apparatus like this, that a fraction of the impurities will still remain. Many hobbyists who construct devices for distillation, however, are doing so with alcohol in mind. When working with alcohol, though, there are more complicated factors that I, being one who doesn't drink, am unfamiliar with. If you do want to distill alcohol, check whether or not it's legal where you are and then consult an experienced guide.

In short, we're using the facts that different liquids will boil at different temperatures to separate liquids, or to separate them from dissolved solids. It's not quite that simple, but the approximation works well enough for our purposes - if the purity isn't high enough after one distillation, we can simply do it again. Anyway, once the distillate has evaporated and most of the other components of your mixture are left behind, it's forced through the distillate tube into the condenser, as that's the only path available. While there it is cooled by the condenser bath and returns to its liquid state, and gravity then pulls it down through the tube into a its new container, separate from the other solutes.In reality, each liquid is independently competing against its own gaseous phase. In a pot of water at room temperature, through Brownian motion molecules are constantly flying free from the liquid into the gaseous atmosphere, but just as many water molecules are diving back in. Overall, there is no change, and we say that the system is in dynamic equilibrium. However, if we put the pot of water on a lit stove, the additional thermal kinetic energy of the water molecules means more are able to break free. Eventually, enough are in the atmosphere that as many come back in as are let loose and we reach equilibrium again. We quantify this in terms of vapor pressure, which is the pressure a vapor exerts when in equilibrium with its condensed (usually liquid) state. The boiling point is simply when the vapor pressure reaches the pressure actually exerted by the surroundings (atmospheric pressure, unless the container is sealed). For that reason, above the boiling point equilibrium no longer involves any liquid - it would all be gaseous. Imagine we're trying to distill isopropyl alcohol (boiling at 180.7\u00b0F) and water (212\u00b0F) - at 180.7\u00b0F, when all the isopropyl alcohol has evaporated, much of the water should also have evaporated at equilibrium - see this Wikipedia page. We can work the system, however, by repeating the distillation process to continue removing about the same proportion of the remaining water. I'm not sure if there's any benefit to trying to work quickly before equilibrium is reached since you'll have less of both fluids in the gas phase, not just less of the one with the higher boiling point, but that may also help.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 2: Scientific Explanation"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Now it's time for the list of materials and a little thought behind each:Distillation vessel - This is the container for your sample you want to distill. Size and shape may matter depending on your heat source - I wanted to keep it simple and use a stove, so the natural choice was a plain old pot. Other thrifty options are a fishbowl or vase if you want glass or a coffee or paint can if metal's your thing. Each has pros and cons. Glass is very inert, has low thermal conductivity, is transparent, and can crack if heated too quickly. Metal is usually stable but can be corroded more easily, has high thermal conductivity, is opaque and won't crack when quickly heated.Lid - I used a glass lid with a ventilation hole I found for $1 at Goodwill. This makes it easy to remove and return the lid if I want to add something to the distillation vessel, and I can see inside. The ventilation hole makes it extremely easy to add the condenser tube - if you can't find one, you could try unscrewing the handle and putting the tube through the screwhole. I wasn't worried about the lid cracking as I turned up the heat because it's not taking heat directly from the stove's flames. It will still be subjected to the high temperatures inside the vessel eventually, though, so it still needs to be able to withstand them.Distillate tube - I don't quite know what mine is made of since I picked it up at the Habitat for Humanity ReStore. I tested it and it seems to work fine, and in fact I was able to take advantage of the way it becomes formable under heat. If you have a metal tube, that would probably be even better since it could dissipate heat more quickly. Plastic and metal (if it's thin enough) can both be wound up inside the condenser too. If your sample is reactive, you may have to find a glass tube and pick a longer container for a condenser. Be warned that in my case the tube began to droop (i.e. it started to melt, but the fire wasn't hot enough for it to melt completely) near the distillation vessel, and some plastics may release undesirable chemicals when heated. I definitely will be improving this design with a metal tube.Condenser bath - I used a plastic jar from Costco's mixed nuts since that was the right size, on hand, and easy to work with. Since we'll be keeping this cool (in comparison to the distillate, at least) I'm not concerned with its stability under high heat.Drainage tube - This tube doesn't need to be anything special; it'll be used to let out warm water and only needs to be flexible and longer than the condenser is tall. That way, we can stop drainage by simply bending the tube upward so gravity holds it in. Alternatively, if you want to be fancy and happen to have a nice manually controlled valve, you could just use that instead.Caulk - I found a tube of kitchen and sink caulk already open in our workshop - lucky me! This is how we'll seal holes we drill in the condenser for the tube. All it needs to be is watertight, so if you don't have this and can find something else that prevents leakage, go for it.Distillate receptacle - When your distillate comes out of the condenser, it'll need somewhere to go. Your choice again depends on the distillate, for as usual, you don't want the distillate and container to react. You may need to think about other properties of the distillate as well - for example, will much evaporate at room temperature and pressure?", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 3: Materials List"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Let's get to building it! The first step is shaping our distillation tube. If yours is metal, bending it should be straightforward - you won't have to worry about it bouncing back into its original shape. If you're using plastic that can be repositioned when heated like I am, you can use some binder clips and twist-ties to wrap it up the way you want and then put it into a pot of boiling water. Mine kept its new shape after about two minutes in the water. This step may not be absolutely necessary, but it certainly makes the tube easier to work with, and it's convenient to do if you were already hardboiling eggs anyway. (I don't know where the tube has been, so I was sure to cook the eggs before the tube.)Afterward, I found that it would have been better to have more unwound tube on the ends so that I would be less restrained when positioning everything.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F7L/VG8Q/I7D5WVJY/F7LVG8QI7D5WVJY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH2/Z1XL/I7D5WVJX/FH2Z1XLI7D5WVJX.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Prepare the Distillation Tube"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Next it's time to secure the tubes inside the condenser bath.

Put the drainage tube somewhere low, since only water above the tube will be able to drain out. I wouldn't put it on the bottom, though, because that would be problematic when you want to set it down somewhere. I kept mine long enough that I could simply tuck it into the top when I'm not draining it.This was my first time working with caulk, so if you're new to it I encourage you to seek more experienced sources.

The boiling temperatures of the components of your sample will determine the temperatures you need to work with, which in turn may influence your choice of heat source and condenser bath fluid. You'll need your heat to reach the boiling points and you'll need your condenser to be at a temperature lower than that - in each case, the greater the difference, the more quickly you can do things, although you should keep the temperature of the distillation vessel under control so you can boil off one fluid and then another rather than just boiling everything off. To get an idea of some common flame temperatures, see Wikipedia. For my purposes right now, a stove flame and tap water (with some ice to keep the temperature lower for a longer time) are perfectly sufficient.Retrospectively, I'd like to have given it a longer distillation tube so my condenser wouldn't be as close to the heat source as it is. I also would like to add a thermometer so I can infer what should be boiling and what should be mostly liquid from the temperature. In keeping with the made-from-scratch spirit of this project, I'd go for a barbecue or oven thermometer that can read temperatures up to 500\u00b0F.There's more to be done and I plan to build another with the insights I've gained from this first try.

In general, it's good to be thinking of what sort of characteristics your fluid has. For example, is it acidic, or maybe a solvent? Plastic is a cheap and convenient material, and differents types of plastic will be affected by the fluids passed through them in different ways. It's not hard to find free solvent/plastic compatibility charts such as this one online.As I stated earlier, heating a liquid to vaporize it as is done in this apparatus won't separate the solution perfectly and you can always expect to have some contamination by other liquid. How much of a problem this is depends on your intended use.Depending on what materials you use, what chemicals you distill, and what temperatures you attain, contaminants may also leach from your apparatus. For example, many plastics are known to leach chemicals, and copper also is liable to leach.Even after being condensed, some distillates may have a tendency to evaporate if they're not properly contained. While in some cases this simply means you're losing some of the product, in others it could be worse. Some distillates can be hazardous to your health via inhalation. Others may be flammable, a risk which is amplified by our use of a heat source. If you're using a stovetop, propane torch, etc. this is especially important, but don't forget to watch out for other possible unintended ignition sources as well.Sometimes a bit of heat provides the necessary activation energy to initiate chemical reactions. If you're using chemicals for which this is a concern, you probably have enough knowledge or experience that you're already aware of the danger. Nonetheless, be sure you consider whether or not anything in the solution you wish to distill is reactive.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 3: Safety Considerations"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "As I usually do, I used whatever was available and would do the job. Below I list the parts and explian how they'll be used so you know how to make one with alternative parts.MaterialsSteel coffee can - This is the vessel that contains your solution you'd like to distill. It'll be heated directly, so I opted for steel; I needed to be able to drill through it and insert a nipple easily, so I chose a coffee can. Lid - The lid simply prevents the evaporated gas from escaping into the atmosphere, so I just found one that fit my can. This time, you don't want one with a hole.1/4\" nipple - This connects the can to the first segment of the condenser tube. If you find a condenser tube of a different size, then your nipple would need to be a different size to match. Only one end needs to fit the condenser tube; the other can be any size.1/4\" sink tubing - For the first part of the condenser tube, which will be attached to the heated distillation vessel and close to the heat source, I wanted something that I could be confident would stand up to the heat it would face. I'm fairly certain there's a plastic tube inside the steel braiding/covering/whatever-it's-called, but these things are made to transport hot water, so I wasn't worried about it melting. On account of the nut-like screw-on endings, its inner diameter is about half its outer diameter, which is important for the next segment.1/4\" tubing - This is the second segment of condenser tube. It will hold the small tube and the coolant, which will probably just be ice water. It needs to fit in the nut-like ending of the sink tube. The closer the fit, the better. Small flexible tube - Because this tube carries the distillate coming out from the sink tubing, it should fit into the smaller inner part of the  sink tube. Again, the tighter the fit, the better.1/4\" valve or spigot - This allows for easily controlled drainage of the coolant when it warms up and needs to be replaced.ToolsDrill bits - We need one size to make a hole in the can for the nipple and another that's the size of the small distillate tube.Caulk - The caulk will fill in gaps where connections are made with tubing, including where the nipple connects to the can, so it needs to be heat-resistant.Funnel - I only use a funnel to make filling the large tube with ice water easier.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 4: Materials and Tools"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Two problems were apparent in my last attempt - first, the tube began to droop and deform under the heat, and second, the tube's slope wasn't great enough for gravity to pull the condensed distillate out unless it was fairly full. The two-segment condenser is my solution to the first problem. As it stands, the first condenser tube (the sink tube) is only cooled by air, which could be improved with a simple heatsink from aluminum cans or foil or by simply wiping it with a cool wet cloth periodically. My main concern for this first tube, though, was just to put some distance between the plastic tubes and the heat source, and it does the job nicely.For the second problem, merely finding a taller condenser bath than the plastic nut jar  I used last time so I could give the distillate tube a steeper declination would mean I'd have a much larger apparatus. That could be somewhat inconvenient, and I had already had some trouble dealing with how everything must be positioned in my previous apparatus. As I thought about how to deal with this, I had a new idea: why not put one tube carrying the distillate inside another carrying the ice water?

A good way to store utensils is to separate them into materials, i.e. rubber, scrap metal, scrap glass, chemicals, etc. The more meticulous one is, the easier it will become to locate needed materials for a procedure. \u00a0Safety First!: There are certain safety rules you must follow, and these should be present within a given procedure. As a general rule, \u00a0ALWAYS Use chemical gloves, an old coat, and safety goggles. Do not drink or eat during a procedure. Use closed toe shoes (no sandals). Also, experiments producing gas should be done outside or under a ventilation directing device. Remember that a safety shower and wash station is readily available in the home in the form of a shower, sink, or hose. \u00a0Please watch this video, as it is very comprehensive on home chemistry safety: \u00a0Home Science Safety VideoAcids/Bases: An acid contributes hydrogen cations (protons) to a solution, whereas a base donates an electron pair (this is a simplified definition).

There must be two separate waste receptacles: one plastic pail for hazardous waste (i.e., broken glass,\u00a0flammable\u00a0substances ) and another for regular waste. For hazardous chemicals, methods of disposing are usually on the labels of bottles. If in doubt, do some research on local recycling and collecting centers.\u00a0Labeling: Make sure to always label chemicals stored in vials correctly. A rigorous approach would require that molar concentrations and safety information also be\u00a0labeled. \u00a0Also label storage compartments with their contents (see picture). These compartments would vary depending on the scope of each lab, though a good rule is to store tools and spare parts separately. \u00a0Environment: It is always a good idea to build your lab near a window or well ventilated area. Make sure that you save space by using organizers as depicted in my mini lab setup. Good lighting is important when carrying out experiments. It's also a good idea to have a designated area outside of your house for experiments which may require it. Always know what you are doing in an experiment, as it may not be stated explicitly that gas products may form.\u00a0Lab Aesthetics: A poorly conceived lab will just look like clutter.

Usually these include a large amount of small diameter, flexible copper refrigerator tubing. While these stills can be quite effective, there is just something a little hokey about them. Especially the part where you run a large amount of expensive copper tubing through a bucket of standing water to cool the condensate. Then there's the issue of a high surface area on the interior of the tubing, which makes small volume distillations difficult to impossible. Plus they're bulky, unwieldy, and they look like a meth lab. I do have to give the authors of these projects some credit however, since DIY is typically about getting the job done, form follows function, etc etc. BUT... I say there is a better way. By using a small amount of 1/2\" and 3/4\" copper pipe, it is possible to build a lightweight, compact, collapsible, interchangeable, universal distillation apparatus for anything you could possibly hope to distill. The apparatus featured here is capable of efficient low to medium volume distillations and could in principle be scaled for use in high volume applications. It is constructed from relatively inexpensive parts which are available at any hardware store. UPDATE 10/27/2011: If you find the start-up costs for this project to be prohibitive, I recommend this instructable. I was inspired to build a distillation apparatus during an organic chemistry lab where we were required to identify an unknown organic solvent by IR spectroscopy. The samples they gave use weren't pure and we had to distill them first so the IR machine could get a good spectrum. This apparatus is modeled after the one I used in that lab. In the lab the apparatus was made of lab quality glassware. Since I don't know how to work with glass, and I DO have experience remodeling houses, I decided to combine my experiences to make an affordable, clean, safe, glass alternative distillation apparatus. So. Now I've got your attention. Read on, my friend.&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;br /&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;", "title": "Build a Lab Quality (ish) Distillation Apparatus.", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Build-a-Lab-Quality-Distillation-Apparatus/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Ugh. I really hate this part. Can't I just ask you guys to be smart and leave it at that? Ok, here we go! SAFETY: This project requires the use of tools and equipment that may be HAZARDOUS if handled improperly. Soldering of copper pipe requires the use of an open propane flame that can cause severe burns and fires. Never point a propane jet at anyone or leave one unattended for any period of time. HOT metal looks like COLD metal. Distillation is a method of separating liquids that are in solution together, often as a form of purification. However, only proper, professional testing can positively identify the constituents of a given distillate. If you are purifying comestibles, DRINK AT YOUR OWN RISK. UPDATE 10/27/2011: DO NOT use lead solder. DO NOT use this to distill hydrogen peroxide or any other potentially explosive chemical. DO NOT allow blockages to form in the distillation pot outlets. DO NOT use radioactive materials as fractionating column filler. RESEARCH aluminum and decide for yourself whether it poses any danger. LEGALITY: In my own backwards country where the vestiges of prohibition are still rampant, it's illegal to manufacture certain distillates without a permit for the still in question. We'll just leave it at that. I don't think it's a problem to distill anything else, but I haven't checked so don't take my word for it. If you're in a country that allows it, then I highly suggest the HomeDistiller where you will find the finer points of ethanol production described in beautiful detail. The same principles apply to ethanol used for fuel, but as mentioned in the comments section, a still must still be registered to distill fuel. Still. UPDATE 10/28/2011: Please visit TTBgov for more information about US law regarding the use of a distillation apparatus. Basically, they make it impossible for a regular person to distill liquor. Producing fuel ethanol is somewhat do-able. All other distillations are ok.

ISBN 978-1429219563.Imagine you have a big stack of differently colored marbles. For whatever reason, you want to sort your marbles into different piles based on their color. So you begin to go though and pick out the colors one by one. If you have a small number of marbles this won't take long. But now imagine your marbles are about a billionth of a meter in diameter and there are so many of them it would make Avogadro, er, I mean your head spin. Well, it wouldn't be very practical to go through with a very small tweezers, picking out all the marbles that are the same color. Indeed, color loses its meaning at those scales anyway. So we have to use some other method to sort them, hopefully a method that doesn't involve much manual sorting. I'll return to the realm of not insulting your intelligence now. Distillation is a method of separating two or more liquids by taking advantage of their differences in vapor pressure. Vapor pressure is the pressure exerted by the gas above a compound. All compounds have vapor pressure, even solids. Granted, the vapor pressure of steel is much less than that of, say, water. Given this fact, it would be fairly easy to separate water from steel, yes? Vapor pressure is exerted by ice. This means ice can evaporate, and in fact this is what causes freezer burn. But what if we have two liquids that have relatively similar vapor pressures (but still different) and we can't just use some sort of filter to separate them? Let's say we have two liquids A and B. A and B have a vapor pressure at room temperature of 22Torr and 40Torr, respectively (Torr is a unit of pressure). Let's say we have exactly the same amounts of A and B in a container. This means that the composition of the liquid is 50%A and 50%B, but the vapor ABOVE the liquid has a composition of 22/(22+40)=35%A and 40/(22+40)=65%B. There is significantly more of compound B than compound A in the vapor! By the way, this is probably a horrendous oversimplification of the proportions, and I COULD flip though my O-chem book to find the correct relation, but I'm sure you get the general idea. Now, if we can collect this vapor and turn it into a liquid, we would have a liquid of composition 35%A and 65%B. We would be one step closer to separating our compounds. In fact, we CAN collect the vapor and turn it into a liquid by cooling the vapor down so that it condenses. And as luck would have it, as we remove vapor, it is replenished constantly by the liquid below. Unfortunately, this process will be EXTREMELY slow because the vapor pressures are so low and very little vapor can escape from the liquid in the container in a given amount of time. It could take days or weeks to separate them. If only there was a way to raise the vapor pressure... Well there is. And we do that by adding energy, in the form of heat, to the system. By adding heat, we can raise the total vapor pressure within the container to exactly 760Torr, but no further. This is because 760Torr is the pressure of the Earth's atmosphere, and it is at this point that the liquid in the container begins to boil. Now we can collect the vapor above the liquid and it will be replenished VERY quickly. The boiling will actually push the vapor out of the container, and as long as we channel the vapor through something cold, thereby reducing the vapor pressure once again, we can condense it and collect it as a liquid with a high concentration of compound B. This is what a distillation apparatus does, and one distillation step is referred to as a \"simple distillation\". A mixture of liquids is placed in a pot that is heated to boiling. The temperature of the vapor is measured by a thermometer at the top of a vapor column, as an indication of relative purity. Condensate (distillate) is usually collected over a certain temperature range, which is indicative of the purity of the result. The vapor travels through a condenser that cools the vapor, returning it to a liquid state that is a different composition from the starting liquid. If we do this over and over again, we'll eventually get a liquid that is nearly pure B, and almost no A. Note that purification actually takes many repetitions of distillation. Well, that's kind of a pain. What if we want to completely purify something very quickly? That's where fractional distillation comes in. A fractional distillation column is a device wherein MANY distillations occur in ONE step. The fractional column is a long tube that is packed with a material high in surface area but low in volume. Glass beads, chambers separated by plates, and various shredded materials work well as packing. As vapor travels up the column, a temperature gradient is created (higher temp on bottom, lower temp on top). This causes vapor to condense on the packing as it rises. The condensed material is higher in purity than the starting material. Then more vapor travels up the column, heating this condensed liquid to its new boiling point and vaporizing it, with the vapor being one step higher in purity than the last step. As the composition skews further toward B, the boiling point drops, reinforcing the temperature gradient as the material travels up the column. This occurs many times as vapor travels up the column, with the lower vapor pressure liquid separating out and dripping back down the column and flowing back to the original container. Fractional columns are often referred to as reflux tubes for this reason. The use of a perfect fractionating column would result in very sharp jumps in temperature readout on the thermometer. As each pure compound is exhausted in the container and the next lowest boiling compound climbs the column, the temperature will rise quickly, indicating the change in compound. Performing a distillation using a fractional column is referred to as \"fractional distillation\" and results in a highly purified liquid. This project allows for the use of both types of distillation, since many raw products to be distilled contain organic solids that can contaminate the packing of a fractional column, and MUST be simply distilled first to remove these impurities.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FRV/KL6C/GU2F3TJC/FRVKL6CGU2F3TJC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKU/SFZF/GU2QYP2C/FKUSFZFGU2QYP2C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWZ/4X9C/GU1UZ2SP/FWZ4X9CGU1UZ2SP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFI/S1V8/GU1I4IRG/FFIS1V8GU1I4IRG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZM/33BC/GU2F3THP/FZM33BCGU2F3THP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Distillation Theory."}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": " First of all, an apology: I really despise the British Imperial system of measurement.

You have a pile of raw materials sitting in front of you, patiently waiting for you to turn them into something amazing. Get to it. Cut the pipe to length.

One 12\" long 3/4\" pipe. You need to put a slight bend at one end of the 18\" long 1/2\" pipe. This is tricky, and it's what the 1/2\" couplings are for. Use the metal file to file away the pipe stops on the inside of one of the couplings so it can slide freely over the 1/2\" pipe. Place the slide coupling about 3\" from the end of the pipe. Place the other coupling on the end of the pipe. Now find some way of bending the pipe gradually WITHOUT KINKING IT. This is hard to do. Kinking it will result in liquid build-up behind this raised section. It's not the end of the world, but it represents a loss of distillate, which is bad for efficiency. Denting the pipe first with a brass hammer where you want it to bend helps. The couplings help prevent the circular diameter from distorting at those points so you won't have problems joining things to those points later. Alternatively, you could use the easily bendable 1/2\" pipe that comes in rolls that is made from soft copper, but this may make the whole apparatus weaker in the end. Using the file again, file away the stops on the 3/4\"x1/2\" adapter so it can slide freely over the 1/2\" pipe. Using the drill, drill two holes in the 3/4\" pipe section, 1\" from each end, on the same side of the pipe. The 1/4\" refer tube needs to fit into this hole snugly.

If you've done your prep work properly, this step is easily the most fun. If you've never soldered copper before, I suggest starting with the columns that will end up vertical, since these don't involve non-standard joints. Use the joint brushes to thoroughly clean the areas to be joined. The copper should be bright and lustrous before you solder. Use the flux brush to apply flux to all surfaces you want to bind together with solder. This means the inside of the fitting AND the outside of the pipe. Then place the pipe inside the fitting, make sure it goes in all the way. Place the part in a vice (wrap it in a towel to avoid marking the beautiful copper) or on the edge of a table. Remember, this copper is about to get VERY HOT. I've found that trying to flux and solder joints that are far from each other in one soldering run is a bad idea. When flux is heated and not soldered it loses is flux-iness. The joint will need to be re-fluxed or the solder won't flow correctly. If joints are literally right next to each other this isn't a problem. Fire up the torch and adjust the knob so that the bright blue cone of flame within the outer flame is about an inch long. Touch the tip of this inner flame to the joint, preferably near the lower surface (heat rises). Touch the solder to the OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE JOINT from the flame. The ENTIRE JOINT must be hot enough to melt the solder for the solder to flow, so this prevents making a bad joint. Slowly melt the solder into the joint until one drop of solder falls from beneath the joint. This ensures you have placed enough solder. If you want a clean-looking joint (no solder blobs), quickly (before the solder solidifies) brush the exterior of the joint with the flux brush AWAY FROM YOUR FACE.

I think it would be best for you to examine the pictures and figure this out for yourself. Most connections are self-explanatory, with a few exceptions. The condenser is the most complicated bit. The 18\" long 1/2\" pipe resides on the INSIDE of the 3/4\" pipe. The 1/2\" pipe is one continuous piece with the 3/4\" pipe sheathed around it concentrically and held in place by the 3/4\"x1/2\" adapters. There is very little space between the two pipe walls by design. It is ESSENTIAL that water be able to easily flow through this outer space between the two pipe walls. This outer sheath of flowing cooling fluid is what allows the whole apparatus to be so compact. Problems arise in assembly because the water is introduced to the chamber by the 1/4\" copper tubes. If the 1/4\" drilling burr or the 1/4\" tube itself protrude too far into the chamber, it will restrict the flow of cooling water by contacting the outer surface of the 1/2\" pipe. Use the file to reduce the size of the burr (you want a little bit there to help the soldering process) and make sure when you solder the tube in place it is just barely going past the inside wall of the 3/4\" pipe. Solder the 1/4\" tubes in place FIRST so you can see what you're doing. Then clean (with sandpaper on the 1/2\" pipe), flux and solder the two joints made by the 3/4\"x1/2\" adapter NEAREST to the the bend in the 1/2\" pipe. Fit the other adapter onto the opposite end but do not flux it. The second adapter is just there to keep the pipes aligned for now. ALIGN the 1/4\" tubes so that they will point UP (in-line and away from the 1/2\" bend). Solder the joints near the bend in the 1/2\" pipe. The 3/4\" and 1/2\" pipes are now bound concentrically by one soldered adapter. Now flux and solder the second adapter. When the assembly cools, make sure the cooling chamber is sealed except for the 1/4\" tubes by blocking one with your finger and trying to suck air out of the other. Then try to blow air though the chamber. If you've got a good seal and good air flow then congratulations, the rest of this is a piece of cake!

Somehow you will need to find a way to install a 1/2\" female adapter into the top of the distillation pot. What worked for me may not work for you. Here's what I did: I drilled a hole in the top of my pressure cooker with a 3/4\" hole saw, where the little pressure release nub is. I had to remove the nub first so I could center the drill in the resulting hole. Then I tried to solder the back end of the female adapter to the top of the pressure cooker. Apparently copper solder doesn't like to bond to aluminum. I thought about making some kind of escutcheon that I could solder to the female adapter on the inside of the pressure cooker. I gave up on that idea. I tried to use a big metal spike and a hammer to widen the back of the female adapter and that didn't work, I just ended up with a big spike stuck in there. Then I got frustrated so I beat the crap out of the female adapter with a big mallet and it flattened it. That gave me an idea. I got a new female adapter and put it though the hole in the lid (threads facing the outside of the lid) and rested the threaded end of the adapter on the anvil of my vice. Then I placed the ball end of a ball pean hammer on the soldering part of the adapter. Then I beat the ball pean hammer with the big mallet. This deformed the back end of the adapter so it had a lip. Then I beat the crap out of the adapter with the mallet directly and flattened the lip against the lid of the pressure cooker. The thing works beautifully.

This is especially important for the tube that will become the fractionating column, since that's supposed to be pure output. Right now your fractionating column is a lot of column and not a lot of fractionating. You need to pack it. The setup in my lab looked like it was packed with steel wool. I had my doubts about this but I went and got some coarse steel wool and tried it anyway. Don't do it. Bare steel doesn't like heat and organic compounds. Go to the grocery store. Go down the cleaning supplies aisle. Go to the dish scrubbing section. Look for the old fashioned metal mesh dish scrubbers. There are three kinds: Stainless steel, galvanized steel, and copper. Don't get the galvanized one. Zinc is good for you in small amounts, but I don't know what the solubility of zinc is in an environment like the one you're making. Go for copper. Then you can tell your homeopathic friend that it's all copper and has healing properties and therefore you should drink this. Remove the wire/staple that holds the scrubber together and unravel it. Kind of like a sock huh? Now get a wire/cord and feed it down your column and tie it to the end of the unraveled scrubber. Pull the scrubber though the column.

I'm sure you're anxious to try it out on something. One important caveat I've mentioned before: DON'T use your fractionating column on runs that have organic solids! This could contaminate the mesh. For these things you should perform a simple distillation first, then go for the fractional distillation afterwards. Save your fractionating column for the high purity runs. That being said, pot scrubbers are two for $1.50. It's not really a huge loss if one becomes contaminated, it's just something to be aware of if you're wanting something really pure. For any compound you have that you want to purify, you can look up the boiling point to get an idea of when to start collecting distillate. Look for MSDS information at places like Sigma-Aldrich. Say you have a mixture of compounds A, B and C, and you want only B. Look up boiling points for all three compounds. Lets say they are 65C, 78C, and 100C. After performing a simple distillation over the entire range and collecting distillate from 65C to 100C, do a fractional distillation. If there is much of compound A, the temperature readout will rise until it hits 65C, where it will plateau. Discard distillate that is produced at this temperature, it's almost pure A. When A has been exhausted, the temp will rise until it gets to 78C where it will plateau again. Collect distillate from range B. This distillate is almost pure B. Then discard from range C.

See if you can make it drinkable. This is where you'll need to play with coolant flow, since you can actually get slow coolant at boiling temperatures by the time it gets to the upper tube during water distillations. This only happens when you're distilling almost pure water, or in the situation where the main component of the distillation pot has a boiling temp above that of the coolant. Keep an eye on bubbles coming out of the upper tube, and check the temperature of the output coolant occasionally and adjust the flow as required. Distilling water lets you find out if there are any bad tasting residues remaining in your apparatus as well. Next up would be isopropyl alcohol. See if you can reduce the volume of 50% isopropyl by 50%. Note: Isopropyl alcohol has approximately the same boiling point as ethanol. So be very careful about contaminating your still before trying to distill something you want to drink. Isopropyl evaporates fairly quickly though. If you live in the US, don't do what I tell you to do in the four sentences after this one. Next would be wine. Try to make brandy. Experiment with the flavor of \"heads\" and \"tails\" with something you know to be methanol-free. Then go to the HomeDistiller to get more ideas. Try making perfumes or plant extracts. Many plant compounds boil at temperatures above 100C, but will azeotropically distill along with water in many cases.

I fermented malted barley and some added table sugar. Regular ale yeast. Then I put something that may or may not have been the fermented product into the distillation pot and performed two simple distillations. The results were not much better than before. I removed all heads from below 85C. After obtaining something resembling ever clear from hell I diluted it doubly and put a mint tea bag in there for a few minutes. I took that out and covered the jar with two layers of coffee filter for a few days. The result is drinkable, but just barely. 06/01/2013: Ok, ok, ok.

Use whatever beer/bread yeast you want and ferment 5 gallons of what looks like beer. Don't put hops in there.

I will probably be making things glow around my apartment in the coming days.The original paper at the bottom used baking soda and fructose over the course of an hour.

I spent an hour and a half to get QD's just using baking soda. The sucrose would only decompose to Glucose and Fructose at high temperatures for extended periods of time. When simple sugars are in a basic solution, they can form the quantum dots. So using the acid and heat, I made lots of free fructose and glucose, but then I had to make the solution basic again. So we added baking soda to neutralize the acid, but that isn't enough, when acetic acid and baking soda mix, they form sodium acetate which acts as a weakly acidic buffer solution. So i added plenty of sodium bicarbonate to the instructions to overcome the sodium acetate's buffering properties.All in all, it was a fascinating challenge and I hope I've satisfied everyone's curiosity today.Additional Reading and references https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/201...https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21691...Fascinating paper using Smartphones and carbon dots. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-11572-8Nitrogen doping CQD's. https://www.nature.com/articles/srep05294https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jnm/2015/787862/", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFP/84F4/JSYZ9A6H/FFP84F4JSYZ9A6H.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Discussion"}], "channel": "Science"}, {"category": "technology", "description": "I'll show you something cool.For the challenge \"Brave the Elements\".I use water, air and fires.

She lives in a small village far away from hospitals (60 km from our place, 30 km to the closest hospital, 10 km without any normal road in between), so we rushed to her and got there soon after the ambulance. She got hospitalized and in the morning she felt almost well, but doctors weren't able to find the cause of it. The next day we had an idea: it could have been CO poisoning, since she has gas water boiler (on the photo), and was sitting close to it for the whole evening when it happened.We recently bought MQ-7 CO sensor, but never had time to assemble a schematics for it, so this was the perfect time to do so. After an hour of searching internet for any instructions, I realized that I can't find any guide that at the same time follows sensor manufacturer's instructions provided in its datasheet and explains anything at all (one example seemed to have quite good code, but it wasn't clear how to apply it, others were oversimplified and wouldn't work well). So we spent about 12 hours for developing schematics, making and printing 3d case, testing and calibrating the sensor, and the next day went to the suspicious boiler. It turned out that CO levels there were extremely high, and could be fatal if CO exposure time were longer. So I believe anyone who has similar situation (like gas boiler or other combustion happening inside a living space) should get such sensor to prevent something bad from happening.All that happened two weeks ago, since then I improved schematics and program quite a lot, and now it seems to be reasonably good and relatively simple (not 3-lines-of-code simple, but still).

During low temperature phase, CO is absorbed on the plate, producing meaningful data. During high temperature phase, absorbed CO and other compounds evaporate from the sensor plate, cleaning it for the next measurement. So in general operation is simple:1. Apply 5V for 60 seconds, don't use these readings for CO measurement.2. Apply 1.4V for 90 seconds, use these readings for CO measurement.3. Go to step 1.But here's the problem: Arduino can't provide enough power to run this sensor from its pins - sensor's heater requires 150 mA, while Arduino pin can provide no more than 40 mA, so if attached directly, Arduino pin will burn and sensor still won't work. So we must use some kind of current amplifier that takes small input current to control large output current.Another problem is getting 1.4V. The only way to reliably get this value without introducing a lot of analog components is to use PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) approach with feedback that will control output voltage.NPN transistor solves both problems: when it is constantly turned on, voltage across the sensor is 5V and it is heating for high-temperature phase. When we apply PWM to its input, current is pulsing, then it is smoothed by the capacitor, and the average voltage is kept constant. If we use high frequency PWM (in the sketch it has frequency of 62.5KHz) and average a lot of analog readings (in the sketch we average over ~1000 readings), then the result is quite reliable.It is critical to add capacitors according to schematics.

Modification of a standard breakout module is required! Without modification module is useless. Modification is described in the second step.It is important to use pins D9 and D10 for LEDs, since there we have outputs of hardware Timer1, it will allow to smoothly change their colors. Pins D5 and D6 are used for buzzer, because D5 and D6 are outputs of hardware Timer0. We will configure them to be inverse one to another, so they will switch between (5V, 0V) and (0V, 5V) states, thus producing sound on buzzer. Warning: this affects Arduino's main timing interrupt, so all time-dependent functions (like millis() ) won't produce correct results in this sketch (more on this later).Pin D3 has hardware Timer2 output connected to it (as well as D11 - but it's less convenient to put wire on D11 than on D3) - so we are using it to provide PWM for voltage controlling transistor.Resistor R1 is used to control brightness of LEDs. It can be anywhere from 300 to 3000 Ohm, 1k is rather optimal in brightness/power consumption.Resistor R2 is used to limit transistor's base current. It shouldn't be lower than 300 Ohms (to not overload Arduino pin), and not higher than 1500 Ohms. 1k there is a safe choice.Resistor R3 is used in series with sensor's plate in order to create a voltage divider. Voltage on sensor's output is equal to R3 / (R3 + Rs) * 5V, where Rs is current sensor's resistance. Sensor resistance depends on CO concentration, so voltage changes accordingly.Capacitor C1 is used to smooth input PWM voltage on MQ-7 sensor, the higher is its capacitance the better, but also it has to have low ESR - so ceramic (or tantalum) capacitor is preferred here, electrolytic one won't perform well.Capacitor C2 is used to smooth sensor's analog output (output voltage depends on input voltage - and we have quite a high current PWM here, that affects all schematics, so we need C2). The simplest solution is to use the same capacitor as C1.NPN transistor either conducts current all the time to provide high current on sensor's heater, or works in PWM mode thus reducing heating current.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FNP/0HRA/IYLZQV2X/FNP0HRAIYLZQV2X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR9/W46N/IYLZQV38/FR9W46NIYLZQV38.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6M/JT1B/IYLZQXQO/F6MJT1BIYLZQXQO.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Schematics and Breadboard"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "WARNING: SENSOR REQUIRES MANUAL CALIBRATION FOR ANY PRACTICAL USE.

Rough calibration is very simple, precise is quite complex.On the general level, program is rather simple:First we calibrate our PWM in order to produce stable 1.4V required by sensor (proper PWM width depends on a lot of parameters like exact resistor values, this particular sensor's resistance, transistor's VA curve etc etc - so the best way is to try various values and use one that fits best).Then, we continuously run through cycle of 60 seconds heating and 90 seconds measurement.In implementation it gets somewhat complicated. We have to use hardware timers because everything that we have here needs high-frequency stable PWM in order to function properly.The code is attached here and can be downloaded from our github, as well as schematics source in Fritzing.In the program there are 3 functions that handle timers: setTimer0PWM, setTimer1PWM, setTimer2PWM.Each of them sets timer in PWM mode with given parameters (commented in the code), and sets pulse width according to input values.Measurement phases are switched using functions startMeasurementPhase and startHeatingPhase, they handle everything inside. and set proper timer values for switching between 5V and 1.4V heating.LEDs state is set by function setLEDs which accepts green and red brightness on its input (in linear 1-100 scale) and converts it into corresponding timer setting.Buzzer state is controlled using functions buzz_on, buzz_off, buzz_beep. On/off functions turn sound on and off, beep function produces specific beeping sequence with period of 1.5 seconds if it is periodically called (this function returns immediately so it doesn't pause the main program - but you have to call it again and again to produce beeping pattern).Program first runs function pwm_adjust that finds out proper PWM cycle width in order to achieve 1.4V during measurement phase. Then it beeps a few times to indicate that sensor is ready, switches into measurement phase, and starts the main loop.In the main loop, program checks if we spent enough time in current phase (90 seconds for measurement phase, 60 seconds for heating phase) and if yes, then changes current phase. Also it constantly updates sensor readings using exponential smoothing: new_value = 0.999*old_value + 0.001*new_reading. With such parameters and measuring cycle, it averages signal over approximately last 300 milliseconds.WARNING: SENSOR REQUIRES MANUAL CALIBRATION FOR ANY PRACTICAL USE.

If this process never ends or ends after a single step (resulting in width equal to 0 or 254) - then something is wrong. Check if your transistor is really NPN and is properly connected (make sure you used base, collector, emitter pins right - base goes to D3, collector to MQ-7 and emitter to ground, don't count on Fritzing breadboard view - it is wrong for some transistors) and make sure that you connected sensor's input to Arduino's A1 input.If everything is fine, you should see in Serial Plotter from Arduino IDE something similar to the image. Heating and measurement cycles of 60 and 90 seconds length are running one after another, with CO ppm measured and updated at the end of each cycle. You can take some open flame close to the sensor when measurement cycle is almost finished and see how it will affect readings (depending on flame type, it can produce up to 2000 ppm CO concentration in open air - so even though only a small portion of it actually goes into sensor, it still will turn on the alarm, and it won't go off until the end of the next cycle).

And you should do it if you intend to use it for a long time: in my case, sensor reading in clean air changed for about 30% over 10 hours. If you won't take this into account, you can get 0 ppm result where there is actually 100 ppm of CO. If you don't want to wait for 48 hours, you can monitor sensor output at the end of measurement cycle. When over an hour it won't change for more than 1-2 points - you can stop heating there.Rough calibration:After running sketch for at least 10 hours in clean air, take raw sensor value in the end of the measurement cycle, 2-3 seconds before heating phase starts, and write it into sensor_reading_clean_air variable (line 100). That's it. Program will estimate other sensor parameters, they won't be precise, but should be enough to distinguish between 10 and 100 ppm concentration.Precise calibration:I highly recommend to find a calibrated CO meter, make 100 ppm CO sample (this can be done by taking some flue gas into syringe - CO concentration there can easily be in the range of several thousands ppm - and slowly putting it into closed jar with calibrated meter and MQ-7 sensor), take raw sensor reading at this concentration and put it into sensor_reading_100_ppm_CO variable. Without this step, your ppm measurement can be wrong several times in either direction (still ok if you need alarm for dangerous CO concentration at home, where normally there should be no CO at all, but not good for any industrial application).As I didn't have any CO meter, I used a more sophisticated approach. First I prepared high concentration of CO using combustion in isolated volume (first photo). In this paper I found the most useful data, including CO yield for different flame types - it isn't in the photo, but the final experiment used propane gas combustion, with the same setup, resulting in ~5000 ppm CO concentration.

Sensor seems to slightly change its clean air resistance after exposure, but this effect is small. It doesn't seem to be able to clearly distinguish between 8 and 15, 15 and 26, 26 and 45 ppm concentrations - but the trend is very clear, so it can tell whether concentration is in 0-20 or 40-60 ppm range. For higher concentrations dependence is much more distinctive - when exposed to exhaust of an open flame, curve goes up from the start without going down at all, and its dynamics is totally different. So for high concentrations there is no doubt that it works reliably, although I can't confirm its precision since I don't have any rated CO meter.Also, this set of experiments was done using 20k load resistor - and after that I decided to recommend 10k as the default value, it should be more sensitive this way.That's it.

In this case it will split water into hydrogen and oxygen gas. A dry cell electrolyser is an electrolyser that is completely enclosed; the other type is a wet cell electrolyser which can be two metal plates in a bowl of water. The equipment is fairly simple but the theory behind it is a bit more complicated, if you\u2019re not interested in the theory then skip to step 1. Here\u2019s the theory: the electrolyser uses the different ionic charge on the different atoms in the molecule to split it into its respective charged atoms or molecules, for example, water gets split into Hydrogen and Oxygen because in the water molecule the hydrogen is slightly positively charged and the oxygen is slightly negatively charged. These charges are only very slight, +1 electron volt (ev) for each hydrogen and -2 ev on each oxygen atom. Just for comparison 1 electron volt is 1.6\u00d710\u221219 Coulombs (c) and 1 Coulomb is the charge transported by a steady current of one ampere in one second. The hydrogen is attracted to the negatively charged electrode or Cathode and the oxygen is attracted to the positively charged electrodes or Anodes. At the anodes the oxygen ions loose an electron and bond to form oxygen gas, at the cathodes the hydrogen ions get an electron from the cathode and then bond to form hydrogen gas.

You need four electrodes.\nAs you will find out, the carbon rods are brittle and break easily. So treat them gently.The easy way (pics 1 through 6):\n\t\tTake a 4,5 Volt \"flat battery\" (see pic 1).\n\t\tWith a small saw, cut off the plastic cap (where the poles of the battery stick through) and remove it (Pic 2 and 3).\n\t\tInside the plasic case, you'll find three zinc-carbon cells. They're connected with copper wire. Cut the wires and pull out the three cells.\n\t\tWith a fretsaw, carefully saw loose the very top of the cells. See pic 4.\n\t\tYou can now gently pull out the carbon core from the zinc-carbon cell (pic 5). If you're not gently enough, the carbon rod can break. See pic 6.\n\t\tWith cutting pliers, remove the zinc rim around the plastic cap on the rod's tip. Leave the plastic cap on top of the rod.The less easy way (pics 6 through 8):\n\t\tTake a AA (or C or D) sized zinc-carbon battery\n\t\tWith cutting pliers, cut loose the metal directly below the plus-pole of the battery (pic 6).\n\t\tIn the pile-batteries, the core is stuck into the shell. You'll have to break away the core's surrounding with the cutting pliers (pics 7 and 8). Not so easy, but it can be done.\nRepeat this until you have four carbon electrodes.\nTest the electrodes. With crocodile clamps, connect one electrode to the plus-side of a battery, and an other electrode to the minus-side of the same battery. Put the electrodes in salted water, but don't let them touch each other. You should see bubbles forming against the electrodes: Hydrogen and oxygen!More about electrodes...\nWhen choosing material for electrodes, you cannot use any conducting material you want, unfortunately. The ideal material for this use is platinum, and platinum electrodes are commonly used in labs. BUT... platinum is a very rare and valuable metal, and a set of lab-quality platinum electrodes will set you back at least $80,-. On eBay platinum electrodes that can be mounted on skin are sold for about $5 a set, but I haven't figured out a way to use them in an electrolyte (that is, in the salted water around the electrodes in the jar).\nSecond best choice for electrodes is Graphite / carbon, which is cheap and commonly available. Pencil-leads work fine as electrodes, but the cores of zinc-carbon batteries are much better suited for the job (the are made to act as an electrode, unlike the pencil leads).\n        ", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FKC/NBC5/GI0TGFX6/FKCNBC5GI0TGFX6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0O/YDPQ/GI0TGFX7/F0OYDPQGI0TGFX7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZT/OGHQ/GI0TGFX8/FZTOGHQGI0TGFX8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1U/ZAKU/GI0TGFX4/F1UZAKUGI0TGFX4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSM/D8R1/GI0TJBH4/FSMD8R1GI0TJBH4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPH/8EHR/GI0TGFX3/FPH8EHRGI0TGFX3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4Q/1F0B/GI0TGFXD/F4Q1F0BGI0TGFXD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNL/32M3/GI0TGFXC/FNL32M3GI0TGFXC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYG/VZ72/GI0TGFXA/FYGVZ72GI0TGFXA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUZ/93TA/GI0TGFXB/FUZ93TAGI0TGFXB.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Make the Electrodes"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "\n          The jar's cap is the vital part of the Ballistic Bubble Machine.

Oxyhydrogen is a very volatile gas and can escape through the smallest of slits. Sealing the tube and electrodes (with silicone gel) is vital to the working of the Ballistic Bubble Machine.\nSee picture 1 for a close-up on the lid.Preparing the cap (pics 2, 3 and 4):\n\t\tLay out the holes for the electrodes and the tube. I made a lay-out in Illustrator and stickes that on the cap.\n\t\tWith a nail or center-punch, mark the centers of the holes.\n\t\tDrill the holes in the cap. Use drills that match the size of the tube and the electrodes as close as possible. I used a 4 mm drill for the electrode-holes, and a 4.8 mm drill for the tube-hole.Place the tube (pics 5, 6 and 7):\n\t\tCut a piece of 30 cm from the tube.\n\t\tGive the tube a flange. I cut out a circle (diam. 15 mm) from a sheet of ABS, and drilled a 4.8 mm hole in it. The flange is glued to the tube using superglue.\n\t\tPut a nice layer of silicone kit onto the flange, and stick the other end of the tube through the appropriate hole in the cap.\n\t\tPull the tube through the cap, and push the flange firmly against the inner side of the cap. The silicone gel should bulge between the cap and the flange.\n\t\tWith a wet finger, smear the gel neatly against the rim of the flange and the cap.Place the electrodes (Pics 8, 9 and 10) (very similar to placing the tube):\nThe electrodes from the batteries have a ready made flange, which make them very easy to mount.\n\n\t\tPut a nice layer of silicone gel on the flanges, around the electrode.\n\t\tStick the electrodes through the cap (remember, the electrodes must go INTO the jar)\n\t\tPush the flange firmly against the lid.\n\t\tWith a wet finger, smear the silicone neatly against the flanges' rim and the cap.\nNote: If you're using a metal cap, it is possible that the electrodes will be shortcutted.

These elements will form H2 and O2 molecules, which escape from the water in bubbles.\nThe funny thing is, that when the hydrogen and oxygen-bubbles are put together again, they won\u2019t re-unite into water-molecules all by themselves. They must be given a little \u2018push\u2019 to do that. When 'pushed' (for instance with a spark or a flame), oxygen and hydrogen will bond again as water-molecules, with a loud crack and some heat as a thank you.Rocket fuel\nThe heat that is produced when hydrogen and oxygen are combined to water, makes rockets launch. The large clouds that appear when rockets launch, are made of pure and plain water. The large tanks that are mounted under the space shuttle contain hydrogen and oxygen seperately. So, somewhere at Nasa, there must be a BIG Ballistic Bubble Machine.Q's and A's, from the top down\nThere's a lot to tell about what's happening when cracking knalgas-bubbles. The questions and answers below are a sort of cascade: The answer to the first question gives rise to another question, and so on...Q: Where does the crack come from, when the bubbles are lighted?A: What happens during the crack is an extermely fast reaction between one oxygen (O2) molecule and two hydrogen (H2) molecules. During this reaction, two water-molecules (H2O) and energy are formed. The energy that \u201cemerges\u201d during the reaction causes the crack you hear.\nIn shorthand, the reaction looks like this:\n1 O2 + 2H2 \u2192 2 H2O + energy\nIn a picture, it looks like pic numer 3.Q: Why is the reaction so extremely fast, then?A: The reaction can happen so fast, because in the gasbubbles there is exactly one oxygen molecule present for every two hydrogen-molecules. So after the reaction, there will be no oxygen or hydrogen left. Such a mixture of gasses is called a stoichiometric mixture. In dutch, it's called an \"explosive mixture\".Q: So where does this \"explosive mixture\" of hydrogen and oxygen come from?A:\u00a0The oxygen and hydrogen come from the water inside the jar. Water is a \"compound\" of two atoms hydrogen and one atom oxygen: H2O. In the jar, the water-molecules are decomposed into hydrogen and oxygen.

It should be able to be found in any store that sells auto parts. (Comes in a yellow container.) Note: \"Iso-Heet\" is not the same thing as \"Heet.\" As it is instead Isopropanol (Isopropyl Alcohol), and this should not be used. Aside from clearly saying \"Iso-Heet\" on the bottle, it instead comes in a Red container so it should be easy to distinguish between the two. -The second ingredient is simple Sodium Borate, better know as Borax. This is used as a laundry booster, and as cleaning agent. As such, it should be able to be found anywhere those items are sold. Note: If by chance you have Boric Acid instead of Borax, you can use it instead in the same way.Other things you'll need, but probably have already laying around: -Scooping/Mixing Utensil (Spoon, Popsicle stick, Ect.) -Matches/Lighter/Fire Source -Fireproof Bowl, Preferably Metal   If you have all of these, we can move onto the next step.", "title": "How To: Ghastly Green Fire, at Home!

Next take some of your Borax (Also known as Sodium Borate, Sodium Tetraborate or Disodium Tetraborate) and also add it to your bowl (You could also instead use Boric acid if you have it.) I'm using a couple of spoonfuls, you should note that it doesn't take that much. You should then stir it for around for about 30 seconds. By mixing the Disodium Borate (Borax) with the Methanol (\"Heet\") what we are doing is synthesizing Trimethyl Borate, which burns distinctively Green due to the presence of the Element Boron. So after you have thoroughly mixed it up, all you have to do is light it with a Match or such. Remember, keep your hands away from where the flames will be to avoid accidentally burning yourself. If all is right, you should have some really cool green flames to look at. After awhile though you'll more than likely start getting some Golden Yellow highlights to the flames, and then eventually they'll turn yellow all together. This is simply from the flame burning down enough that it reaches the Sodium Borate. The Sodium Borate burns distinctively yellow due to the presence of the Element Sodium. This overpowers the Green color of the Boron fairly easily.  This is why using only a little Borax is better than using a whole bunch. If you use Boric acid however, this shouldn't happen seeing as it contains no Sodium. Welp that's it, just remember to have fun and be safe, this is playing with fire after all! On one last note, this doesn't produce any particularly harmful fumes while burning but it will produce CO2, and large amounts of this can be bad. So just to be safe, please do this in a well ventilated area or even outside. This can also cause certain fire alarms to trigger (Ionization Fire-Alarms in particular) so unless you want a sudden scare, it's best to once again do this in a well ventilated area or outside away from any of said alarms.

Many parts of the world suffer from lack of clean water to drink and heat to cook their food and get by from day to day. This instructable is designed to try and provide a cheap means of providing clean water and heat to cook with for a very low price tag. Hydrogen is very easily made by using electrolysis which can be driven from green technologies such as wind and solar power. Electrolysis will work with stagnant or dirty water to provide Hydrogen and Oxygen gas. This gas mixture is highly combustible and as such makes a great fuel source. The added benefit is that burning hydrogen and oxygen produces 100% pure water.There are probably lots of flaws with this design and essentially what you are making can be very dangerous if left powered and unattended so please be advised. I've since been  employed in the embedded industry for over 8 years and have learnt a  massive amount so please if you have any questions (about electronics /  microcontrollers / Arduino) then let me know.

So ok with these methods we have electricity being produced so now we need a method to use this electricity in our current technology. This is where electrolysis comes into the picture. Electrolysis was discovered in 1800 by an English man named William Nicholson. The reaction that occurs during electrolysis is simple, two electrodes are placed in parallel and submerged in a liquid, the electrodes can be made of stainless steel, aluminum or any other metal as long as it doesn\u2019t react with the liquid and has a high surface conductivity. When an electrical potential is placed between the electrodes in water the only path the current can flow is via the impurities in the water. At the electrodes electrons pass through the water from the cathode to the anode creating concentrations of oxygen and hydrogen at the anode and cathode respectively.Electrolysis may seem a simple and useless process to use for energy but when used on water a very unique reaction occurs, where there was a hydrogen oxide molecule there becomes two hydrogen molecules and a oxygen molecule (see Fig 2). As both of these new substances are gasses at room temperature they collect into bubbles and rise to the surface of the water as a mixture. This mixture then makes a readily available fuel source that can be used in an engine, cooker, boat, automobile, airplane, heating e.g. all of the products that run on fossil fuels today such as petrol or coal. One drawback to hydrolysis is when using salt water as this produces chlorine gas which is very harmful. This side effect can be easily avoided by removing any salt content through evaporating the water first. In this project tap water will be used as the means of fuel storage so this problem will not apply.Since the discovery in 1800 and first documentation in 1832 by Michael Faraday, hydrolysis has been used multiple times to try to produce a new form of energy. However none of the products made have ever been very useful due to problems such as lack of efficiency and speed of gas production. Recently though hydrogen technology and electrolysis has come back into the lime light as the fossil fuel industry starts to collapse. Honda\u2019s newest car for example employs a high pressure tank of hydrogen to power in its fuel cells to power the car.Unfortunately one of the electrolysis researchers called William Rhodes claimed the invention for himself and named the output gas \u2018Browns gas\u2019. He claimed to get more energy out of the hydrogen then was put into the water to create it in the first place. This is obviously against the laws of physics and thermodynamics but still he used his rouse to extort a great deal of money, claiming it was for further research. He then disappeared with the money and was never heard from again however his inventions (scams) still live on.Another Recent development that has helped the start of the hydrogen industry was the fairly new discovery of hydrogen fuel cells (see Fig 3). These are constructed from two chambers to hold hydrogen and oxygen with a PEM (Proton Exchange Membrane or Polymer Electrolyte Membrane) separating the gasses. When hydrogen and oxygen are present on either side of the material a current is generated, water and heat are given off. However there are difficulties with this technology as when the fuel cell is running one side of the PEM tries to dry out and will crack if not kept wet, the other side needs to be dry to conduct the current and is producing water. This makes it difficult to get the fuel cell to work at all or for any sustained period so it will not be included in the project as the budget and technology is limited.here is however hope for the hydrogen industry in sight, a company in Australia seem to have got it right, producing goods such as water fueled generators, fuel cells, electrolysis chambers, hydrogen boilers etc, proving that if used correctly hydrogen can be a very useful and versatile fuel medium.With all this information in mind a project was chosen to demonstrate this remarkable technology and the benefits that it would bring to the fuel and power industries. The aim of the project is to make a cooker to demonstrate how simple it is to manufacture the hydrogen and oxygen fuel mixture locally on site and as needed to prevent the need for storing excess. To demonstrate this technique and test its efficiency the project is going to be based on a hydrogen cooker with gas being produced locally in a sealed pressurized chamber. Figure 4 on the left shows this said system with a device between the input gas chamber and the output hob. This device allows combustion to be quenched if it manages to travel up the fuel pipe before it manages to reach the hydrogen production chamber.(Fig 5) is a picture of the first electrodes that was constructed to test the feasibility of the output gas as a fuel source. The electrodes were made by sanding down a steel can and shaping a steel metal plate around a bottle so it would fit around the can. Wire was then threaded around the can to insulate it from the metal sheet and act as a spacer to keep the distance between the plates constant. Using a 12 volt battery connected to the anode and cathode of my electrodes I submerged the device in tap water and waited for a result. The output was almost immediate and to my surprise the whole surface area of the steel plates was covered in bubbles of gas given off from the process.To provide power for my hydrogen cooker system it was decided that green energy should be used because if the system was just plugged into the mains then the process would be running mainly on fossil fuels and would defeat the purpose of this clean recyclable energy. The green energy chosen to power the cooker was primarily solar as this is a well established technology and it is generally always light for some time every day (see Fig 7). A second green energy was then included to complement the solar power and help to keep a trickle of charge running to the battery. This was chosen to be wind power as wind is present all day and night and it is also easy to implement with a simple motor and spinner assembly (see Fig 6).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FLQ/3LIL/I3OFOZR5/FLQ3LILI3OFOZR5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F58/J77R/I3OFOZS3/F58J77RI3OFOZS3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7S/5ZDO/I3OFOZSP/F7S5ZDOI3OFOZSP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI6/UGOZ/I3OFOZSQ/FI6UGOZI3OFOZSQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQA/DOJN/I3OFOZUD/FQADOJNI3OFOZUD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG8/B9XE/I3OFOZUE/FG8B9XEI3OFOZUE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYX/3FVQ/I3OFOZVG/FYX3FVQI3OFOZVG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Alternative Energy and the Hydrogen Industry"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The cooker system will be constructed as shown in Fig 8. It will consist of a solar cell and a wind turbine powering a rechargeable battery through a regulator. The battery will then power a microchip microcontroller connected to a L.C.D screen and the chamber electrodes. The production chamber will also be monitored by the microcontroller by means of water level, hydrogen pressure and temperature sensors. The sensors outputs will be displayed on the L.C.D and hydrogen production will be shut off after a certain pressure (around 5psi) to ensure safety.(Fig 9) The first chamber made and designed to produce the hydrogen for the project. After construction it was ascertained that although the chamber was water tight and pressure tight, it probably wouldn\u2019t be very hydrogen tight. Therefore another technique was employed to manufacture the production chamber. Instead of trying to make the whole chamber, bought components with seals would be obtained and used instead to guarantee hydrogen would not escape at least short term.After shopping around looking for the strongest and best sealed container, it was decided to use a heavy duty straight drain pipe connector and two heavy duty drain pipe end caps. These were chosen because they were strong and resilient and also came with a perfect seal ideal for trapping in hydrogen. These drain pipe pieces are to be connected into the designed system by means of using polycarbonate squares to grip the ends of the two caps (see Fig 10). The polycarbonate will then be squeezed together using strips of threaded metal studding. The controller electronics will then be attached to this studding and encapsulated inside a box to prevent any unwanted sparks getting near to the hydrogen.With the hydrogen and oxygen mix being produced there will have to be measures put in place to ensure the safety of surrounding population. The worst thing that could happen is if a flame or spark got into the production chamber and came into contact with the pressurized gas. Using a fish tank bubbler submerged in a separate water tank (Fig 11), there is no way for a combustion to travel from the hob to the production chamber.Rather then a propane or butane cooker which needs a large quench gap, primary and secondary air mixing to burn correctly, hydrogen needs a much smaller quench gap to prevent the combustion reaching the inside of the gas pipe. Also unlike propane or butane, hydrogen cannot have primary or secondary air mixing as oxygen is already inside the mixture. As the gas travels though this quench gap there is a maximum amount that can travel though the hole at any time. Therefore the bigger the quench gap is, the more gas that can come through, making it easier for the combustion to travel back through and along the stream of gas. For hydrogen this small quench gap (Approx 1mm) keeps the system from rapidly loosing pressure and also to help prevent the combustion reaction from traveling back past the gap and further up the pipe. (Fig 12) shows a hydrogen burner with steel wool covering the quench gaps in the piping. This steel wool is useful as it firstly reduces the temperature of the burning hydrogen by limiting the surrounding oxygen from reaching the reaction, and secondly useful by acting like a catalyst. Once the gas is ignited the wool will get heated up and then act to combust any further gas as it flows through helping to create a steady output temperature.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FDR/CR40/I3OFOZW2/FDRCR40I3OFOZW2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTD/95LQ/I3OFOZW3/FTD95LQI3OFOZW3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF3/JB9Q/I3OFOZXM/FF3JB9QI3OFOZXM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRD/JF50/I3OFOZXN/FRDJF50I3OFOZXN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKI/4PAS/I3OFOZYL/FKI4PASI3OFOZYL.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Design Concepts"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Firstly a second experiment was done by using several aluminum plates and separating them with various insulators to vary the width between the plates (see Fig 13).

Estimated output was decided on disturbance of water, quantity and size of gas bubbles. After testing lots of insulating sizes and recording the findings, the best result was when the plates were around 1mm apart.Now that a suitable insulating gap had been found more plates were added to maximize conductivity and spacers were glued to each plate in every corner (see Fig 14). The plates were then held together by means of two pieces of strong pieces of elastic. Each plate was tested for connectivity to its wire and that no connection was present to its surrounding plates.The wires were then cut to size and secured in place by the elastic (see Fig 15). Bits of the plastic insulation from some mains cable was used to separate the places were the cables touch the electrodes to guarantee that none of them would touch their neighbor.The finished electrodes were then placed in the bottom of the chamber (Heavy duty drain pipe end piece).

Output gas from the chamber was piped into a container of water and allowed to bubble into an upside down submerged container (see Fig 19). A stop watch was then started to measure how long it took the electrodes to produce 250ml of the hydrogen and oxygen mix. After only 11 minutes of producing gas the 250ml level was reached and the electrodes were then deactivated. The hydrogen and oxygen was then tested for its purity by raising the container up out of the water at the same time as inserting a lit splint into the gas. (Warning... I don't advise you do this unless you know what your doing!!!). A rather loud \u2018pop\u2019 came from the mixture as it combusted proving that there was indeed hydrogen and oxygen present in a substantial enough level to provide power for a device. The bubbler chamber was not needed for this test as currently no hydrogen or oxygen is being held and allowed to build up anywhere to any hazardous (explosive!!!) pressure.(Fig 20) is the completed hydrogen production chamber with analogue safety pressure gauge attached.

The adjustable legs allow the panel to be faced towards to sunlight from just about any location. Each panel was then connected in series to provide to maximum voltage possible and a standard low noise and low attenuation phono cable was attached. When tested in sunlight with open circuit connection voltage across the cells was upwards of 20V. Testing with the voltage connected across a load of 1K Ohm allows for the power of the solar cell to be calculated. Power in Shade =  20mWPower in Light =  53mW                     Power in Sunlight =  145mWThe wind generator was made by simply mounting a motor on a small square of Perspex with the shaft facing through the Perspex. A wind spinner was obtained from Ebay.co.uk and attached to the motor shaft by means of a bored out gear. A second larger square of Perspex was then used for the bottom of the spinner to rest on, allowing for the motor to spin with less friction as the weight of the spinner is no longer resting on the motor brushings. Legs were then cut from steel piping and glued into place to support the spinner in a strong wind (see Fig 22). It was then found that the spinner could spin both ways in the wind which means that the motor would either be chargingor discharging the circuit. This is obviously not acceptable so a diode rectifier was used on the motors output voltage to provide a correct positive voltage to charge the battery. A second problem was that the wind blowing on the spinner would cause it to accelerate and decelerate as the direction of the wind changed and therefore the direction of the spinner. This was solved by placing strips of laminated card down the legs in order to channel the wind and make the spinner rotate in the preferred direction (see Fig 23). A low noise and low attenuation phono cable was again used to output the voltage.Now to implement the constructed hydrogen and oxygen production chamber two circuits have to be made. The first circuit is going to take current from the solar cells and wind turbine and then allow a lead acid 12V battery to be charged. This circuit will also provide power to the second circuit.

These devices are necessary because they contain a sensing circuit allowing for the current flow into the battery to be regulated. In a series regulator (see Fig 24) current is switched off when the voltage rises above a preset level. In a shunt regulator (see Fig 25) rather then switching off the power, the excess power is spent through a separate load.Although series regulators are simple to implement they have two disadvantages to shunt regulators. These disadvantages being that series regulators do not use all of the power produced to go on charging the battery and allow the battery level to drop to under charge status before switching the charger back on. Due to these disadvantages a shunt regulator will be used to control current flow into the battery from the green energy sources.The schematic for the shunt regulator circuit (Fig 26) allowing the solar and wind generated current to charge the battery. When the battery is charged up to 13V the current is disconnected from the battery by means of a 1 Ohm power resistor load and a red L.E.D lights. Then when the battery voltage drops below 10V again the shunt regulator once again connects the input current back into the battery again. The circuitry employs the use of a 555 to allow for sampling of the battery level rather then a continuous feed which would waste more current. A green L.E.D lights when the circuitry is feeding current into the battery. The circuit also allows for the input battery terminals to be connected via wires into the other microcontroller circuit previously described.The printed circuit board was designed by looking at the size of each component to go into the circuit and making pin templates to match their connection on the board. Then when all of the components had a pin layout, the components were arranged and rearranged around each other to allow for the least connection to have to be made. Whilst doing the rearranging and re-wiring of the circuit, attention was paid to the reverse orientation of any Integrated Circuits present in the circuit. This is due to the fact that the circuit is on the other side of the P.C.B to where the components are. Once a suitable circuit diagram had been made the diagram was cut out and lightly stuck onto a piece of copper clad fiberglass board. The copper clad board was then cut down to size and 1mm holes were drilled through to allow component pins to fit through and be soldered later. Next the circuit diagram was peeled back off the copper surface and after a bit of a sanding to remove any impurities from the copper surface the circuit tracks were drawn on with a etch resistant pen. The board was then left for twenty minutes to dry before being submerged into a bath of hot diluted ferric chloride hexahydrate to dissolve away any unshielded copper on the board. After another twenty minutes the board was removed and rinsed well with cold water to purge any remaining chemicals. Another quick rub with some sandpaper and the circuit board is complete and ready to use. After soldering all the components into place on the P.C.B Wires were attached to allow for flying L.E.Ds and input power connections. A small plastic case was obtained and drilled to allow the L.E.Ds and phono attachments to fit into place (see Fig 27 and Fig 28).(Fig 29) is the completed shunt regulator attached to the chamber as described above (Fig 10). The red wire that can be seen inside the larger box is one of the two output wires from the shunt regulator to power the control circuitry and the electrodes.

These alternative configurations are as follows: A. Use a simple Pic microcontroller controller to address multiple remote A.D.Cs and use an A.D.C for every sensor input. B. Use a simple Pic microcontroller with one remote A.D.C and use remote relays to switch between the sensor attached to the A.D.C input.  C. Use a slightly more complex Pic with a built in A.D.C module to input all of the sensor readings straight to the microcontroller.For the project it was decided that option C of a Pic with built in A.D.C was a better choice due to less circuitry involved and therefore hopefully less things that can possibly go wrong in the manufacturing stage. The Pic that was chosen was the 28 pin 16F870 as this provided up to 5 A.D.C channels with 21 input/output pins in total. This was also chosen because when running at a clock speed of 4 Mhz the actual program speed is 1 million instructions a second. This is obviously more than enough to control a simple L.C.D screen, a few sensors and some electrodes.The first circuit to be designed for the Pic 16F870 was just intended to allow the microcontroller to run and be available for in circuit serial programming or ICSP (see Fig 30). The circuit was designed by following the instructions for timing and electrical setup on the chips datasheet.The next stage of development for the circuit was to build a LCD interface to the Pic16F870. The LCD that is being used is a 20 character by 2 line display with optional backlight (see Fig 31).The LCD is interfaced by a 16 pin connection where 11 or 7 of the pins need to be interfaced directly by the microcontroller. Out of these 7 or 11, 1 is chip enable, 1 is read or not write, 1 is data pulse enable and the other 4 or 8 pins are used for the input/output data bus. In order to avoid using too many of the microcontroller input/output pins these 7 pins can be condensed down to two pins by using a simple I.C. with 4 flip flops, 74LS174 (see Fig 32). The other 5 pins on the LCD are for ground, input voltage 5V, Contrast control via the 10K potentiometer and the last two pins are used for connection to an inverter to power the backlight. With the LCD working it was ascertained that the backlight was not necessary for the LCD to operate correctly so an inverter was not obtained to power the circuitry. The 74LS174 in the circuit below operates by taking a serial input of data and then shifting this data throughout the flip flops until there is four bits of information to pass to the LCD via its four or eight pin data bus. When the last of the data is loaded in the reset pin becomes high canceling out the effect of the 1n914 diode causing a higher voltage on the data bus then usual. When this abnormal voltage level occurs there is current left to carry on to the enable pin on the LCD to clock the four bits of data into the LCD\u2019s memory.By combining the 2 pin LCD circuit with the ICSP circuit and connecting the data and clock pins to pins C4 and C5 respectively we now have a P.C. programmable LCD controller (see Fig 33). The Pic16F870 was programmed with the assembler code for 2 pin LCD (see Software Listings) via a Velleman K8048 PIC programmer with ICSP output header. With the LCD circuit working and displaying text the controller circuit is now ready to take in sensor readings and output the data via the display. To send the data to the LCD display the microcontroller needs to send characters in form of two hex numbers or 8 binary numbers.To implement the sensors the microcontroller must use its on board ADC module to interpret the values passed into the ADC enabled ports. These ADC enabled ports are the 5 pins of the A port on the Pic16F870 microcontroller. The ADC module onboard the microcontroller is controlled via the use of several eight bit registers embedded inside a few of the chips memory locations. These special ADC registers are referred to as ADcon0, ADcon1, AdresL and AdresH. The ADcon0 memory register location controls the operation of the ADC, the speed of the comparison and the triggering of the conversion process. The ADcon1 register controls the addressing for the output pins and control to switch on or off the reference voltage. For the project ports A0 to A2 were enabled with the ADC function to provide input ports for the temperature, pressure and battery level. Also in this ADcon1 register is the option to justify the 10 bit answer  to the left or the right hand side of a 16 bit register. The 16 bit register is really made from two 8 bit registers inside the microchip which are the previously named AdresL and AdresH. The reference voltage was set at +5V or VCC this is always going to be stable as long as there is power to drive the microcontroller as it is being supplied from a 12 volt source through a 74LS05 voltage regulator.The Temperature sensor or thermistor was configured by consulting the device\u2019s datasheet and looking at the temperature to resistance graph. Three values of temperature were chosen to configure so that their output onto the ADC would give a readable measurable value similar to the data sheet. This was calculated by dividing 5V by the total resistance from 5V DC to ground. The required voltage is the divided by the previous number calculated. As can be seen in Fig 34, resistances for the thermistor have been recorded at several key values in order to calibrate the input circuitry. The thermistor was then connected to the controller circuitry by means of a twisted pair connection. This type of connection was chosen because of its high immunity to noise and its low cost to put into practice. To create the twisted pair, the two ends of a long wire were taped to the rotating shaft of a hand drill. The middle of the piece of wire was then secured, allowing the wire to be wound around itself. By keeping the wire slightly taught at all times the twist of the wire can be made uniform which helps to increase the cables noise immunity. A value for half way through the exponential response of the thermistor was chosen at around 145 Ohms. The error can then be calculated by the microcontroller to give an accurate reading.R uC  = V uC / (VCC / R total)The Battery sensor was constructed in a similar manor to the temperature sensor with the total voltage varying instead of the resistance. The 12 volts passed from the shunt regulator is variable depending on the charging status and the charge in the battery. The 12 volts was then connected across a potential divider circuit to bring the voltage down to a level readable by the ADC on the microcontroller. To be able to give accurate readings of the voltage on the LCD the resistances again have to be calculated and recalculated to provide a low voltage that is a linear representation of the input 12 volts. Seeing as the  system voltage can only really go between 14 volts at a max and 8 volts as a minimum these are the values that were used to calculate the required potential divider resistor values.The pressure sensors however were not so easy to configure and proved to be quite troublesome towards getting the project working. The circuit diagram for connection taken from the device datasheet (Fig 35) showing the four pin pressure transducer in a wheatstone resistor bridge circuit. From the diagram it was taken than the device came hosting the bridging circuit and it would be a simple case of connecting the positive and negative Vo to the input positive and negative terminals on an op amp. The device powered up and seemed to be working as I gave an output to the ADC. However the output value to the ADC from the pressure transducer was fixed and didn\u2019t vary at all with pressure change. On the second look at the datasheet circuit diagram (Fig 35) it was decided that it was possible that the device maybe did not have built in bridge resistors. A circuit was built up around the pressure transducer to perform the balanced bridging function of the wheatstone bridge. The output of the bridge circuit was again fed into the inputs of an op amp to give the difference of the positive and the negative as a voltage. When the pressure transducer was powered up in the bridge circuit it again fed a fixed constant number to the ADC indicating that either the part was faulty or there was something further to the electronics that was not fully comprehended. Every other attempt to interface the pressure transducer caused the microcontroller to crash or run in a very bizarre manner.Due of the above difficulties with the digital pressure sensor it was not possible to include it in the project. However with the backup analogue pressure gauge the pressure inside the production chamber can still be monitored accurately so it is not a great loss to the systems overall performance.The next device to be connected to the controller circuit was the level sensor. This consisted of a pole with a magnetic float that could move along the length of the pole. On either end of the pole were caps to stop the float from coming off, and reed switches to sense the magnets proximity. Both switches are open circuit when the magnet is in the middle of the pole. Using a simple resistor above the value of 4.7K Ohm connected from the microcontroller data pin to ground allows for extra current from the switch to flow around the microcontroller without causing any damage. This resistor is also important as a device to load the input voltage across causing the voltage to be determinable at that junction. The controller software was now upgraded to include all of the sensing devices (apart from the digital pressure sensor) so that the ADC values of each sensor were read alternatively and the data from the sensors was output to the LCD.Table 1 describes the process of each input / output pin used from the Pic16f870 in this project.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FRW/NRL7/I3OFP08O/FRWNRL7I3OFP08O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8H/40XF/I3OFP08T/F8H40XFI3OFP08T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSH/3AUO/I3OFP09T/FSH3AUOI3OFP09T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIP/6MBS/I3OFP09V/FIP6MBSI3OFP09V.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHJ/CKLA/I3OFP09W/FHJCKLAI3OFP09W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZR/YE95/I3OFP09X/FZRYE95I3OFP09X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRX/2K4T/I3OFP09Y/FRX2K4TI3OFP09Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFA/GCWM/I3OFP0AW/FFAGCWMI3OFP0AW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBC/UURN/I3OFPDOZ/FBCUURNI3OFPDOZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Circuit 2 Diagnostics & Control"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "The hydrogen burning hob was constructed using the research of several alternative energy websites, magazines and articles.

Five 1mm gas outlet holes were then drilled into the longer pieces of tubing along their approximate center and all facing the same way. Steel wool was then wrapped around the piping to cover the outlet holes and allow for the catalyst behavior as previously mentioned. The whole piping setup was then attached to a sheet of aluminum with several large heat sinks attached to help dissipate the output heat. An output pipe made of stainless steel was then attached to the t junction at the bottom of the U which then plugged into the pressure proof tubing obtained to contain the hydrogen.(Fig 40) is the sealed hydrogen and oxygen production chamber with electronics and hob attached and ready to be tested. The yellow block that can be seen inside the controller circuitry casing is the connection to the ICSP header on the Pic programmer.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FI6/I7QS/I3OFP0AZ/FI6I7QSI3OFP0AZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJJ/098L/I3OFP0B0/FJJ098LI3OFP0B0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTK/XQ5T/I3OFP0B3/FTKXQ5TI3OFP0B3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Hydrogen Hob"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "Shown here on the right (Fig 41) is the completed hydrogen generator with hob attachment and LCD interface. Labels also added to the front of the shunt regulator to make it easier to tell the plugs apart.Now that the project has been completed it is ready for testing and experimentation. From building the project I now have a much clearer understanding of pressurized systems and of hydrogen production itself so in a sense to me the project was a complete success. I also now have much better knowledge on the workings of LCD and ADC controllers, calibrating sensors and making PCBs to a standard. I have enjoyed working on the project and to me it has evolved lots of ups and downs with things going right or in some cases very wrong. I have completed all my objectives and milestones set in the specification. Since the project would appear to have been a complete success with nothing too major going astray. However there would be a few things that I would change to improve the project were I to restart over. I also believe my project was worth the time and effort because it helped me to get a clearer picture of what to do and not do when working with a pressurized system dealing with explosive gas.Starting again now with all of the useful things I now know about hydrogen technology and making reliable systems would allow me to include all of this knowledge to be able to put it all into the design stage. Rather then how I worked this year doing research and finding out lots of new technologies and solutions to problem while some of the work had already been done. I would spend more time researching everything before hand so that I could start the project with a clearer idea of how to proceed. However I am happy with the construction of the hydrogen production chamber as it is strong and durable and I am also happy with the construction of the green energy systems as they both work well and provide an adequate amount of power.Before the project demonstration I intend to have answers to the following questions by testing my chamber with a few trial runs. The questions are: How long do the electrodes need to be on for enough gas to burn for  15 minutes?   How long does battery last with electrodes on full power?   How long does battery last with charging factors helping to maintain  charge?   How much gas does the water inside the chamber produce?Once the system is working correctly there are still many thing that could be used and tested to optimize the system. For a start the extra power that is created by the green energy could be connected across the electrodes when the battery becomes full. Also if the signal going to the electrodes was A.C. then the electrode plates would charge up as anode and cathodes alternatively. This A.C. frequency could be tuned to the electrode plates to create resonance similar to an inductor capacitor resonator circuit. If there was a proper lab to do research and put work into then spiral electrodes could be made similar to my rather crude attempt in Fig 42. This was my attempt at a spiral electrode and though it looks good it wasn\u2019t anywhere near as tightly wound as I imagined it could be. If two matching spirals were made that could slide in and out of each other leaving a 1mm gap on all sides then this could be used to vary the amount of electrolysis occurring and act as a throttle for the gas production. Also the fact that the material is a spiral means that as much of the surface area is taken up with the electrode material as possible creating the best possible contact with the water.Another recent addition to hydrogen and electrolysis research is a new cultivated bacteria that was designed to eat any waste by product out of the water that electrolysis will no longer work on. As the bacteria eat the waste product they break down the remaining water and produce yet further hydrogen and oxygen. This helps to supplement the voltage induced electrolysis to produce more gas faster and with less energy involved.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FS4/EAOI/I3OFP0C1/FS4EAOII3OFP0C1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2Z/XH6N/I3OFP0D0/F2ZXH6NI3OFP0D0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKU/PY39/I3OFPDS8/FKUPY39I3OFPDS8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQF/VHZD/I3OFOZR0/FQFVHZDI3OFOZR0.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 10: Finished Unit and Conclusions"}], "channel": "Science"}, {"category": "play", "description": "You may have stumbled upon this instructable and thought, \"How does that work?

Many can be found in second hand shops, coin shops, superstores like Wal-Mart, or broken things that you take apart. You just have to know where to look. Scroll down and see for yourself!Some of the things we will be looking for are:Coins     Batteries     Spark plugs     Fishing sinkers     Light bulbs     Jewelry    Electronic devices \u2013 cell phones, computers, etc.Why collect? Element collections are not just the playthings of wealthy eccentrics. Whether you are a lover of science, just curious, or want to make a collection of the elements, possessing samples is a great way to bring the periodic table to life. Even a partially completed element collection makes a wonderful educational tool, and can help to spark interest in science and chemistry in children. In fact, I think that every school should have at least a basic one. Collecting elements presents its own unique challenges. For one, collecting them all is actually impossible! Also:Many  are nearly unobtainable due to their high cost.     Some  are toxic, radioactive, or won\u2019t stick around long because they  have short half-lives (they decay into more stable elements).     Ownership  of some is prohibited by law.     Others  are highly reactive, and must be stored under oil or in a vacuum.    My advice is to enjoy collecting, whether you have two samples or twenty. Take your time; element collecting is a long-term project. Also, if you are unsatisfied with one of your samples, keep in mind that you can always buy a better sample later on. Finally, don't forget to tell people about your collection! That way, when other people run across good samples they will tell you about them or maybe even donate them to you.How To Go About It Obviously, you could use the internet and a credit card to buy samples of the elements. Searching for them offline, however, is much more fun, and is a great way to get your feet wet in the hobby. Unfortunately, there are very few resources to help with this kind of collecting. Starting out, I was discouraged by the seemingly vast amount of research and expense involved, and I think many others probably are as well. I hope this little guide will help you join in the fun, even if you are only casually interested. As with all great hobbies, you can learn a lot from element collecting. Here I will share my findings with you.Going further As your collection grows, you can build a shelf in the shape of the periodic table like the one pictured above to display it. People will instantly recognize the shape of the periodic table, and be drawn to it. To build one like mine, which cost me about $16, check out my instructable. Notice that the samples are not labeled, so people have to guess as to their identity! People who don\u2019t care much about science may be impressed when you hand them an element they have never seen before, or have only seen in photographs.A few notes before we begin: The density, or specific gravity, of the elements is measured in grams per cubic centimeter (abbreviated g/cm3 or g/cc). This is useful for comparing the elements to each other or to water, which has a density of one gram per cubic centimeter. The density of aluminum, for example, is 2.7 g/cm3. This means that aluminum is 2.7 times as dense asan equal volume of water. Heavier iron comes in at 7.874 g/cm3, while even heavier lead is 11.35 g/cm3. The author takes full responsibility for the content of this instructable, and has made every effort to ensure its accuracy. However, due to the difficulty of backing up his findings with references to primary sources, he cannot guarantee the absence of errors. Sorry!

Since 1982, it has been composed of a core of 99.2% zinc and 0.8% copper, plated with a layer of pure copper (Please note that not all pennies minted in 1982 have a zinc alloy core, as member lbrewer42 pointed out. If you go with 1983 or later you will be safe).This makes zinc an easy one. Simply sanding off the copper plating of a post 1982 penny reveals the core of bluish zinc underneath, a sample that is greater than 99% pure.All you need is:A U.S. one cent piece (penny) minted 1982 or later      sandpaper or a flat metal file Be patient! It may take you 10-20 minutes to scratch off all the copper on a penny (without power tools), as you will have to file away all of the coin\u2019s embossed details.What about other samples of zinc?Corrosion-resistant zinc plating of steel (hot-dip galvanizing) is the major application for zinc. Zinc plated items you might easily obtain include:Nuts, bolts, washers, and other mechanical fasteners      Acidic fruit and fruit juices often come in galvanized cans ( the galvanization is on the inside)Zinc is used in batteries; here is a link to a tutorial showing you how to take the zinc from one. The zinc you get from a battery will probably be brittle and corroded, as the ammonium chloride inside the battery reacts with the zinc. See the picture above.Picture note: pieces of zinc from a carbon-zinc battery. Zinc oxide is white, and I presume that is what we are seeing here.Pure zinc is rather brittle, so other metals are added to make it more durable. A predominantly zinc alloy, used for small non-structural castings, is found in things like:Die cast toys like matchbox cars.      Some garden hose fittings.Brass is an alloy of zinc and copper.Fun with zinc!Zinc works well for metal casting, as its melting point (787\u00b0F, 420\u00b0C) is relatively low. This means you can sand a bunch of pennies and place them in a stainless steel ladle, then use a torch to melt them. Working with molten metal is dangerous, so take the proper precautions. Other metals that you can melt include aluminum, tin, and lead.On the other hand, if you do not have a torch, you can still melt the little zinc disks by placing them in an empty steel vegetable can, then putting the can on hot coals like those of a campfire. The can is made of steel so it won\u2019t melt, and it\u2019s thin so it won\u2019t draw much heat away from your zinc. In addition, everybody has one! Because I wanted a larger sample of zinc, I melted down 22 pennies this way, though I did get a fair amount of slag (the scum of oxidization that forms on molten metals) floating on top. This was somewhat due to the fact that I didn\u2019t remove all of the copper plating before melting: I only sanded the edges of the coins. See the picture.Zinc, or even just a piece of zinc-plated steel, makes a good electrode when building a battery out of a vegetable or lemon.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FUD/PY3L/IMNOGTB5/FUDPY3LIMNOGTB5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8N/3Y0N/IMNOGSRM/F8N3Y0NIMNOGSRM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXZ/1RBN/IMDOELTG/FXZ1RBNIMDOELTG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Let's Start With Zinc!"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Many people have a few foreign coins hidden in a drawer somewhere, and this is a great place to start looking for nickel. Nickel has been widely used in coins, though its rising price has led to some replacement with cheaper metals in recent years. U.S. coins have never been made of pure nickel, but rather a copper-nickel alloy. The U.S. five cent piece, for example, is made of 25% nickel, 75% copper. Canada, on the other hand, struck their five-cent coins in 99.9% pure nickel during the non-war years from 1922\u20131981 (during the wartime period of 1942\u201345, most or all nickel was removed from Canadian and U.S. coins, due to nickel's war-critical use in armor). Canada also used 99.9% nickel in its higher-value coins from 1968 - 2000.These are just a few of the pure nickel coins out there:Canadian nickels minted between 1922 \u2013 1941 and 1946 \u2013 1981      Canadian quarters minted 1968 \u2013 2000It would be nice to have a more complete list, but it would require a lot of research. If you don\u2019t have any foreign coins lying around, you can always go to a coin shop. My coin shop had a basket of assorted foreign coins on their counter, for sale at 10 cents apiece. When I found a Canadian nickel minted in 1940, the owner of the shop kindly donated it to me. What could be a better sample of nickel than an actual nickel? Nickel, like iron, is attracted to a magnet. This means that nickel coins will be attracted to a magnet, though coins made of copper-nickel alloy and nickel-plated steel will as well. The color of nickel has a very slight yellowish tinge, but this is often only readily apparent when you are comparing its color to that of another metal.What about other samples of nickel?About 6% of world nickel production is still used for corrosion-resistant pure-nickel plating, like on the toenail clippers pictured above.Many electric guitar strings are nickel wire wound around a central steel core, although some cheaper strings are wound in nickel-plated steel wire.Side Note: At one time Canada was the world\u2019s leading producer of the metal. The nickel was mined in the Sudbury Basin, and the nickel is believed to have been deposited (I think the magma thrown out by the impact contained a lot of nickel anyway)by a large nickel-iron meteorite that created the basin.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F29/3NQW/IMNOGT9A/F293NQWIMNOGT9A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJK/NGUI/IMDOELGG/FJKNGUIIMDOELGG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH3/AQFP/IMNOGSJM/FH3AQFPIMNOGSJM.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Nab Some Nickel"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Sadly, most things referred to as tin, including tin cans and tin toys, are not made out of pure tin. Tin cans are, at best, only steel that is plated with tin. The toys are some kind of alloy that may or may not contain much tin. The best sample I have ever found are the tin fishing sinkers pictured above. As you can see, tin has a very bright, shiny white color.You can find tin fishing sinkers anywhere fishing gear is sold. I found mine at Wal-Mart, and paid 1.78 USD for six removable split shot sinkers, the biggest ones they had. If you haven\u2019t been fishing, you should know that you crimp this type of sinker onto your fishing line by placing the string in the sinkers\u2019 jaws and closing it with pliers. This type can also be removed by squeezing the back of the sinker with pliers; this opens the jaws back up. The sinkers are very soft, and I believe them to be commercially pure tin (99.8%).What about other samples of tin?The primary application of tin is solder. One of the most common solders is 60/40, and is about 60% tin, 40% lead. Some lead free solders can contain as much as 90% tin.Tin cans usually have an extremely thin layer of tin on the outside, and other things like the leads of electronic components are coated in tin.Fun with Tin!When a bar of tin is bent, a crackling sound known as the tin cry can be heard due to the twinning of the crystals. You can hear a very small version of the tin cry, at least a tin whimper, with a tin fishing sinker of the split shot variety. While holding the sinker close to your ear, gently (it will take very little effort!) squeeze the back of the sinker with pliers. The sinker will make little pinging or twinkly noises as it bends and the mouth of the sinker opens. Try to convert it to grey tin:If you put tin sinkers in a freezer that hovers near zero degrees Fahrenheit, they should slowly undergo a transformation. The sinkers are made of tin, in the form of metallic or \u2018white\u2019 tin, but in cold temperatures, the atoms will slowly rearrange themselves into a different crystal structure and the sinker will become \u2018grey\u2019 tin. This transformation is often called \u2018tin pest\u2019, as it is undesirable for something made of tin to transform into grey tin. Grey tin has properties similar to a metalloid (for more about metalloids, see the next step, silicon). Commercial grades of tin (99.8%) resist transformation because of the inhibiting effect of the small amounts of bismuth, antimony, lead and silver present as impurities. I put one of my sinkers in my freezer, which is hovering around five degrees. It has been a month and so far no visible change.Even if you get a sinker to transform into grey tin, keep in mind that it is still tin; the atoms are just aligned differently. It may still make an interesting sample.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F36/M6CX/IMDOELRG/F36M6CXIMDOELRG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYB/UZI9/IMDOF7CG/FYBUZI9IMDOF7CG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU1/KM28/IMNOGSN0/FU1KM28IMNOGSN0.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Take Hold of Tin"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Silicon is a dark grey metalloid. Most elemental silicon lives inside electronic devices, making up the heart and soul of such semiconducting devices as diodes, transistors, and integrated circuits. To see the silicon inside these devices, all you have to do is smash them with a hammer. Sadly, though, the silicon portion of these components can be surprisingly small. The picture above shows how much silicon you can expect to find inside a large rectifier diode. These are black cylindrical devices with a white or silver band at one end. They have two leads, or legs. They are easy to find in many kinds of electronics, and microwave ovens usually contain one large one.To open a diode, you will need:A rectifier diode, the biggest one you can find. They are designated by a cr or d on circuit boards. A hammer      A hard surface you can hammer on      Safety glasses      Pliers      Wire cutters or soldering ironOnce you have found a diode, either de-solder the leads from the printed circuit board (if it\u2019s attached to one) or cut the diode free with wire cutters. Then, while holding one of the leads of the diode in the pliers, rest the body of the diode against a hard surface and strike it with the hammer. Make sure you put on safety glasses to protect your eyes from flying diode fragments. Trust me they\u2019ll be flying. It probably won\u2019t take more than a few hits to pulverize the diode\u2019s casing, and then you can pull the broken pieces away to reveal the silicon junction. If the junction hasn\u2019t broken by now, you will have to hit it with a hammer to break it open, revealing two broken hexagonal surfaces of silicon like you see in the picture. The silicon is not pure; pure silicon is not very useful. Silicon makers spice up their silicon with phosphorus, boron, or other goodies. This is called \u2018doping\u2019 the silicon, and doped silicon has very useful (and fascinating) semiconducting properties.Transistors:A similar technique to what we used with the diode can be used when opening large transistors. Transistors always have three leads, or legs. Integrated circuits:Integrated circuits today mostly come in black plastic packages, though in the past they could be found in ceramic packages or even round metal cans. The case of an integrated circuit can be opened (or more often smashed) to expose the chip inside, though the brittle chip is usually broken to bits in the process. I have had the most luck with old ceramic ICs (some computer processors are still made with ceramic cases) and with the old metal can type. With the can type you can simply cut around, and then pop off, the top of the can. What you will see inside is:In common integrated circuits, a wafer of monocrystalline (cut from a large single crystal) silicon (often refined to an extremely high purity of 99.9999999%) serves as a mechanical support for microscopic circuits: thousands of individual diodes, transistors, or even resistors are created in the top few thousandths of an inch by doping. They are insulated from each other by thin layers of glasslike silicon oxide, an insulator that is easily produced by exposing parts of the wafer to oxygen under the proper conditions. The \u201cwires\u201d that connect the components together are then layered onto the surface of the chip.What about other samples of silicon?Photo-voltaic cells (solar panels) are made with thin layers of silicon. A small panel from a calculator or solar stake light might make a good sample, but I am not sure what you are actually seeing when you look at a solar cell.Silicon is not a metal, but rather a metalloid. Metalloids conduct electricity like the metals, although not as well. They are also more crystalline than the metals, making them hard and brittle. The silicon you will find in semiconductors is brittle and chips easily. In nature, silicon is primarily found combined with oxygen, forming silica. Silica is the main ingredient of sand, quartz, and glass.There are ways reduce silica, or sand, into elemental silicon. They involve fiery chemical reactions.

Pictured above are my carbon samples. The four carbon rods are from batteries that I took apart. At the bottom is a section of carbon fiber arrow shaft, cut from a broken arrow. Both represent carbon in the form of graphite. Graphite and diamond are both carbon, the carbon molecules are simply connected to each other differently. This gives graphite and diamond very different properties. For example, graphite is opaque and black, while diamond is highly transparent. Graphite is soft enough to form a streak on paper, while diamond is the hardest naturally-occurring material known. Densities:graphite: 2.267 g/cm3     diamond: 3.515 g/cm3To remove a carbon rod from a battery:Carbon rods form the positive electrodes inside common zinc-carbon dry cell batteries. These kinds of batteries do not have the word \u201calkaline\u201d on the case, but usually say something like heavy-duty, extra-heavy-duty, or even super-heavy-duty. The rods shown came out of a dead 6-volt lantern battery, and their extraction is detailed in the other pictures. For more detailed instructions on battery disassembly, see this tutorial. Once you get the carbon rod out of the battery, it may have a sticky tar-like substance on one end; this can be removed with a solvent (I used gasoline) on an old rag. Any residual black powder (manganese dioxide mixed with carbon, moist with electrolyte) still sticking to the rod can be wet sanded off, using a piece of wet-or-dry sandpaper and running water. A final scrub with warm soapy water makes the rods ready for direct handling and display.Safety Tip: Disassembling this kind of battery is not exactly dangerous, but you will have to protect yourself from the caustic electrolyte inside. Despite being called \u201cdry cells\u201d, the compounds inside are moist with an electrolyte that is hard on skin and will corrode anything metal it meets. You must wear rubber gloves (or at the very least a few layers of plastic grocery bags) over your hands. Another guide to taking apart a lantern battery.Neat Fact: The carbon rod in the battery is chemically inert, and is used here because carbon is a non-corrodible conductor. Every common metal would quickly be corroded away by the electrolyte. Carbon fiber arrow shafts:Graphite can be formed into strong fibers.

Not wearing any jewelry, you say? How about your cell phone? Inside just about every phone is maybe 50 cents to a dollars worth of gold, in the form of a very thin sheet layered onto the circuit board inside. The gold forms the tiny conductive circuit pathways that connect the many different components on the board to each other, a job more commonly performed by copper.Many people have a few old cell phones hiding in their closet. Circuit boards with gold can also be found in computers, portable mp3 players, and many other miniaturized electronic devices. If you are ambitious, you can extract some of the gold from a circuit board, and then possibly melt it into a little nugget with a torch. The amount of gold on a circuit board is very small though, and is probably not worth all the extra effort. If you want to try it, here\u2019s the link.Gold is also used as plating on electrical connectors. The theory is that because gold won\u2019t corrode, it will always form a good connection. Gold plated connectors can be found on some of the more expensive electronics cables, such as audio, video and USB cables. Quality ear buds and headphones often feature gold plated plugs. The gold plating is not very durable however, and will wear off if the connector is plugged and unplugged enough times. For these applications, a more durable nickel plating is often better. Also, keep in mind that not all gold plating is created equal. Some are thin and look like gold, can be advertised as gold, but are actually so thin that they don\u2019t do a whole lot of good except color the object yellow.Gold plated fuses can be bought, and these may be a small and inexpensive way to get a sample of gold. Or you could just clip the plug off of your beats headphones (ha ha).There is also gold plated jewelry.Next we move on to jewelry, and other fine things that are made of gold.24 karat gold is pure gold. As far as I know it is only available as bullion or bullion coins. These are really expensive, however, so we won\u2019t talk about them here. All the other gold you see in jewelry and other luxury items is mostly not pure because pure gold is too soft to make into anything practical. Other metals are added to make it harder and more durable. A karat is one 24th part. That means:20 karat gold is 20 parts gold, 4 parts other metals, or 83% pure gold.      18 karat gold is 18 parts gold, 6 parts other metals, or 75% pure gold.      12 karat gold is 12 parts gold, 12 parts other metals, or 50% pure gold.      10 karat gold is 10 parts gold, 14 parts other metals, or 42% pure gold.            Keep in mind that the karat system is not precise, and the percentages can be fudged a little bit. For example, a 99% gold alloy can be marketed as 24 karat. If you look at the inside of a gold band or ring, a karat mark, usually a number and the letter K, should be visible.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FRW/PBZQ/IMDOEUQT/FRWPBZQIMDOEUQT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8Q/PHYN/IMCFCTT0/F8QPHYNIMCFCTT0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWW/XW4F/IMCFCTSY/FWWXW4FIMCFCTSY.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Grab Some Gold"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "Want an inexpensive sample of silver? Look no further than your coffee maker. Yup, you heard right. Your coffee maker. If you open up a coffee maker, you will find two small thermal fuses that have silver plated cases and lead wires. Thermal fuses are also found in other heat-producing electrical appliances such as hair dryers, water heaters, hot plates, and space heaters. They function as safety devices to disconnect the current to the heating element in case of a malfunction (such as a defective thermostat) that would otherwise allow the temperature to rise to dangerous levels, possibly starting a fire.What about other samples of silver?We have:Silver plated articles     Silver bearing solder     \u2018junk\u2019 silver coins     Sterling Silver articles     Silver bullion coins and barsCoins are a good representative of silver, as it has been a widely used coinage metal for thousands of years. U.S. quarters, dimes, and half dollars minted before 1965 are all composed of 90% silver, 10% copper. Pure silver is soft, so the copper increases the coin\u2019s durability and helps it resist the wear and tear of circulation. Most of these coins are not in circulation any more, but if you are extremely fortunate, you may still find one in your change. Always check your change! First look at the year on the coin, the silver ones are minted 1964 or earlier. Next, look at the edge of the coin. A silver coin is made of one solid alloy, whereas these coins today visibly consist of a sandwich of different metals. Note: The Morgan and Peace silver dollars are 90% silver as well, but you will never find these in your pocket change. All the 90% silver coins, unless they are in very good condition and therefore have some numismatic value, are called \u2018junk\u2019 silver.To get pure silver you have to buy silver bullion, which is mostly sold in the form of coins, rounds, or bars. One example is the $1 silver eagle, a 1 oz. silver bullion coin issued by the U.S government that is 99.93% silver and only 0.07% copper. These coins are never circulated, and each contains an ounce of pure silver. Although the face value is $1, this is not the coin\u2019s actual value. Silver coins and bullion can both be bought at coin shops. Sometimes you will find the junk silver coins at flea markets or pawnshops. The price of silver, which goes up and down, will dictate how much you pay for them. However, keep in mind that you will not be paying the spot price per ounce that is shown on the precious metal exchange. You have to pay a premium on top of the spot price, and this premium may be large or small depending on what form the silver takes. For example, the U.S. silver eagle mentioned above commands a high premium. Before buying silver, make sure you are an educated buyer so you don\u2019t end up paying too much. If you are new to silver, I recommend reading this article on silver investing. It will show you all the different options.Approximate prices as of January 2016, when the spot price hit a five-year low, and was trading around $14 an ounce, at my local coin shop:a junk silver dime goes for about 1.25a junk silver quarter for 3.13, a silver eagle $18.Silver can be a little pricey for some collectors, but remember that silver will retain its value so you can sell it and regain some of your investment if you want to. You might even make a few bucks if you bought low and sold high. Or, when the zombie horde is approaching you can trade your silver for a hatchet and a case of beer. Cheers!Most silver in jewelry is an alloy called Sterling Silver. Sterling Silver is 92.5% silver and 7.5% copper, meaning it is slightly more pure than junk silver coins. If you have something made of sterling silver, it will have usually had the word Sterling stamped on it somewhere. The only exceptions would be if the Sterling Silver article is too small to have a word stamped on it, or the article does not have an inconspicuous place for the stamp (where the stamp would not ruin the article\u2019s appearance). If it doesn\u2019t say Sterling on it, but it has the appearance of silver, it may be silver plate. Silver plated articles are common, and can be found rather easily in second had shops or at yard/garage sales. There you may also find silver plated flatware. A silver plated trinket or piece of jewelry makes a good sample, or even just a plated fork or spoon.It is a good idea for you to familiarize yourself with the appearance of silver. The most distinctive face is a tarnished surface; silver tarnishes black, sometimes with rainbow hues and other colors mixed in. Silver is actually a slightly better conductor than copper, but is rarely used for electrical purposes because of its price.Note: Oneida and W.M.A. Rogers are manufacturers of silver plated articles.Fun with silver!One way I know to test if something is silver is to place it in the yolk of a hardboiled egg.

You would think this would put it out of reach of the humble collector, but you will be surprised to learn that it doesn\u2019t.To look for platinum, we turn to automobiles. Platinum is the least reactive metal. It has a remarkable resistance to corrosion, even at high temperatures. Because of this, it is used to make electrodes for some automobile spark plugs and oxygen sensors. The spark plugs are now common, and can be bought in auto parts stores and often in superstores like Wal-Mart. They are expensive though, so a better option would be to get used ones the way I did. For most people this might mean talking to a mechanic and asking for old spark plugs that come out of vehicles, but I took mine out of junk cars destined for the salvage yard. The plugs by themselves are cool samples, as they have the word platinum printed right on the side. I was unsatisfied with the visibility of the actual platinum, however, so I cut away part of the plug so I could see it better. To replicate what I did, you will need:Platinum Spark plug     Hacksaw     Bench grinder     Hammer     Small flathead screwdriver     Safety glasses and gloves     Bench viseMy samples are Bosch Platinum plugs, which boast on the package that the center electrode is comprised of a slender 99.9% pure platinum rod. I first donned gloves and protective eyewear. Then, using a bench vise to hold the plug horizontally, I used a hacksaw to cut around the outside of the plug and remove the outer electrode. Next, I cleaned up my rough hacksaw cut on a bench grinder. Afterwards, I rested the ceramic insulator against a hard surface and struck it with a hammer, fracturing it. Finally, I was able to pick off the chunks of broken ceramic around the center electrode with a small screwdriver and reveal the platinum. Once again, you can clean up the possibly sharp edge of the ceramic on the bench grinder. To look at a sample prepared this way, people have the body of the plug to hold onto. What about other samples of platinum?I haven\u2019t done much research on other sources of platinum, as I was satisfied with my sample. However, there is still:Jewelry:Platinum finds use in jewelry, usually as a 90\u201395% alloy, due to its inertness and shine.Catalytic converters:Catalytic converters are vehicle emissions control devices, found on the underside of cars. They look a little like a small muffler, and are mounted just behind the engine with the exhaust manifold feeding directly into them. The platinum (or other platinum group metal or metals) helps complete the combustion of the residual unburned hydrocarbons in the engine exhaust. More research is needed, as converters may not contain platinum in a form that is sample worthy.  Oxygen sensors:Oxygen sensors are mounted very close by the converter, also on the exhaust system. They sense the level of oxygen in the exhaust, and tell the engine\u2019s computer controller if the fuel is being burned properly. Some of them have platinum electrodes.Fun with platinum!Want to record a message that will be readable an eon from now?

Maybe some old fishing equipment that no one uses? This is a good place to look for lead. Fishing sinkers have been made out of lead for a long time, due to lead\u2019s high density (70% more dense than iron). Even if you don\u2019t have any lead sinkers lying around, they can still be bought cheaply at any retailer that sells fishing equipment. The package will probably have the word \u2018lead\u2019 printed on it, or at least something like, \u201cthis product contains lead, a substance known to the state of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm\u201d.

You might be able to pry one off an old wheel rim, as long as it doesn\u2019t have a tire mounted on it.90% of the world market for lead is in storage batteries, because nearly all cars use lead-acid batteries for their electrical needs. Inside these batteries, which are big black plastic boxes, are plates of lead hardened with antimony. Also, the battery posts and clamps are often made of lead. The clamps can be purchased in retail stores that carry automotive parts, and make for sizable samples.Lead bullets and shot, which are alloyed with antimony for hardness, are also a good source of lead. Since it is dangerous to remove the lead slug from a live round, or to remove lead shot from a shotgun shell, I recovered bullets for my collection by digging them out of a hillside. The hillside had been used to back a target. As an extra bonus, I was taking lead out of the environment. Fun with lead!Lead is not very fun, a fact that was brought to the public\u2019s attention recently by a water toxicity crisis in Flint, Michigan. Keep in mind that lead is a potent toxin, and can be absorbed through your skin. To limit your exposure, here are a few guidelines to keep you safe:Always wash your hands after handling anything lead, or anything that contains lead - this will keep it from being absorbed into your skin or finding its way onto things that you touch (or worse, into your mouth). The best idea is to handle lead objects with gloves, or put them in plastic baggies so you don\u2019t have to touch them (this is how I keep my samples).Never sand or grind on a piece of lead \u2013 this is the worst thing you could do, because it puts small lead particles into the air that you could breathe.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FEW/YACP/IMCFCTT2/FEWYACPIMCFCTT2.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Locate Some Lead"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "The element tantalum is indispensable for making electronic components called capacitors. This is because capacitors made with tantalum can be made smaller than other kinds of capacitors, while still performing the same function. They are mostly found inside miniaturized electronic devices, including cell phones, computers, mp3 players, key fobs, and countless others. Tantalum capacitors are also more rugged than other kinds of capacitors, making them reliable even in extreme environments like the one found inside the engine compartment of your car.More than 90% of all tantalum electrolytic capacitors are manufactured as surface mounted chip capacitors like the yellow-orange rectangular ones in the picture. Less common are the epoxy-dipped radial-lead \"pearls\", followed by the very rare axial lead variety. Remember that capacitors always have two leads, or legs. They are designated by the letter C, which is often printed on the circuit board right near the capacitor along with that particular capacitor\u2019s number. Again, see the picture.Placing a tantalum capacitor in your collection is a good representative of tantalum, because it is the prime commercial application of the metal. They can be robbed from circuit boards or bought at electronics stores like Radio Shack. To see tantalum metal, however, you will have to burn off the epoxy or plastic case of one of these capacitors. To do this, you will need:Tantalum capacitor - I suggest the biggest one you can find.     Candle, and something to light it with     Needle nose pliers     Wire cutters or soldering iron (to remove a capacitor from a circuit board)     A good work surface, preferably one that cannot be damaged by heat, in a place where you will be able to find something small if you accidentally drop it.            First, clip or de-solder the tantalum capacitor from the circuit board (if attached to one). Then, while holding it in the jaws of needle nose pliers, hold it in the flame of a candle. The goal is to burn off the insulation on the capacitor. As the insulation burns and turns to ash, you can knock a layer of it off and continue burning. At some point the core of the capacitor will be only covered by a black powdery substance. Don\u2019t confuse this layer as insulation, it won\u2019t burn away. This is manganese dioxide. You should stop heating the capacitor core now, otherwise:If you continue to heat the capacitor after most of the insulation has burned away, you can trigger a rapid exothermic reaction similar to the thermite reaction. The manganese oxide will give up its oxygen atoms, which form new bonds tantalum, burning it to create tantalum oxide. The core of the capacitor will ignite, burning with a small flame of its own for a second or two until it glows white hot. It won\u2019t melt though, as tantalum has a very high melting point (5,463\u00b0F). The reaction only lasts for a few seconds, and it scared me the first time it happened. I wasn\u2019t hurt, but handling anything that hot even for a short time is very dangerous. If you can get all the insulation off without triggering the reaction and fusing your sample, you have a sample of tantalum.The core of the capacitor is made of tantalum powder that has been sintered into a nugget around a tantalum wire. The tantalum nugget is then coated with manganese dioxide, a black powdery substance. The leads are then attached and the whole thing is coated in epoxy.Wet tantalum capacitors:\u201cWet\u201d tantalum capacitors, like the ones on the left side of the picture at the top of this step, are rarely seen. Mostly they are used in industrial, military, or even aerospace applications. They have a wet electrolyte, but still contain a sintered tantalum pellet like the epoxy dipped kind, hence they are sometimes called wet slug tantalum capacitors. Some have silver cases, while others have tantalum casings. The ones I found I robbed offof a circuit board, but I can't remember what the board came out of. I googled the number on the case (109D) and found they are the \u201c109D Commercial Style\u201dwith a \u201csilver case, elastomer seal\u201d.

When I first saw it, I thought it indicated that the tube had failed, or \u2018burned up\u2019. However, this is not the case. Barium metal has been evaporated onto the inside of the glass envelope, forming something called a getter spot. The getter helps to maintain a vacuum, because the highly reactive barium metal combines with or absorbs unwanted gases. While the color of barium metal is silvery-white, this rapidly vanishes upon oxidation, giving way to a dark gray oxide layer, which I assume is most of what we are seeing here. Newer getter spots may appear more shiny and mirror like. If the getter is exposed to atmospheric air (for example, if the tube breaks or develops a leak), it turns white and becomes useless. Barium\u2019s reactivity means that it must be stored in a vacuum or under oil.Manufacture of this type of getter:A look underneath a getter spot will reveal a metal trough, usually semicircular, that contained the barium metal during the tube\u2019s manufacture. After the air was pumped out and the tube sealed, the trough was heated with an induction heater (which was held near the trough, outside of the tube). The trough got red hot and the barium became vaporized, instantly reacting with any residual gas, then condensing on the cool walls of the tube in a thin coating, the getter spot or getter mirror, which continues to absorb gas. This is the most common type, used in low power vacuum tubes. Specialized tubes may use a more exotic getter material like zirconium.I found vacuum fluorescent displays in old microwaves. Vacuum fluorescent displays have getter spots, though LED displays are more common nowadays. I found my vacuum tube inside an old TV, which was in an old dump. The transistor was invented in 1947, and by the late 1960\u2019s had almost completely replaced the vacuum tube.A look around a flea market or antique shop may yield old electronics that contain vacuum tubes, or even just the tubes themselves (I have seen both).Vacuum tubes are still used in high-end audio equipment, notably guitar amplifiers.Note: Keep in mind that not all getters use barium. A functioning phosphorus getter looks very much like an oxidized metal getter, although it has an iridescent pink or orange appearance which oxidized metal getters lack.

A big filament is best, and these come from high wattage light bulbs. Light bulbs used in automobiles can also have large diameter filaments, because they use the lower voltages provided by car batteries. The drawbacks of filament samples are that they are small, and to remove one from a bulb you have to deal with the potential hazard of broken glass. When braking light bulbs, I recommend wrapping the bulb in a piece of cloth like material, then smashing it with a hammer. If you do it right, the glass bits will be contained by the material. Then, you can separate the filament from the bulb. Alternatively, leave the filament in and use the base of the bulb as a holder of sorts.Tungsten is quite heavy, just slightly less dense than gold. It would be cool to have a sample big enough that would allow you to feel this property.What about other samples of tungsten?Wikipedia states that:High-density alloys of tungsten with nickel, copper or iron are used in high-quality darts (to allow for a smaller diameter and thus tighter groupings) or for fishing lures (tungsten beads allow the fly to sink rapidly). Some types of strings for musical instruments are wound with tungsten wires. I have a golf club that advertises copper-tungsten weighting. I can\u2019t see it though; I think it is inside the club head.My wal-mart sells tungsten fishing weights, though they cost around 6-7 USD for four and are no doubt an alloy of some kind.TIG (tungsten inert gas) welding utilizes tungsten electrodes. From what I understand, during welding electricity jumps an arc from the tip of the tungsten electrode to the metal to be welded. At the same time another rod, a filler rod, is placed in the heat of the arc, melting it to form the weld puddle. Tungsten\u2019s high melting point (the highest of any metal, 6129 degrees F) means the electrode can withstand the high temperatures of the arc without melting, though the welding process does slowly consume it.

If you do accidentally touch the face of the button, wash your hands.Americium is a synthetic or manmade (not naturally occurring) element, the only such element to have found its way into peoples\u2019 homes. Most ionization smoke detectors contain a maximum of one micro curie (abbreviated 1.0 uC) of americium.One curie = 37 billion spontaneous nuclear transformations per secondmicro = one millionth part, so 1 micro curie is equal to 37 thousand spontaneous nuclear transformations per second.Sometimes this same figure is given in becquerels, and One becquerel = one spontaneous nuclear transformation per second.Therefore, each smoke detector contains a maximum of 37,000 becquerels (abbreviated 37kBq)Every second, about 30,000 of the americium atoms decay. When they do this, a chunk of the atomic nucleus breaks off and goes flying through the air. Primarily this is an alpha particle, which is two neutrons and two protons stuck together (the equivalent of the nucleus of a helium atom). This leaves behind a nucleus with two less protons, meaning the atomic number of the decaying atom drops by two: Americium, element 95, becomes Neptunium, element 93. Alpha particles, because they are large and positively charged, only travel a few inches in air and are easily absorbed by a few sheets of writing paper.The half life of Americium 241 is 432.2 years.The older a smoke detector is, the more Neptunium atoms it will contain. Neptunium-237 has a half-life of 2.14 million years. This means that you can use americium buttons to fill both the americium and neptunium places in an element display. Why radiation in a smoke detector? Inside the detector\u2019s ionization chamber, there are two metal plates sitting opposite each other. Attached to one of them is the americium button, which is emitting a constant stream of alpha particles that cross a small air gap and are then absorbed by the other plate. Because alpha particles each contain two protons, which are positively charged particles, a tiny potential difference (and a tiny current flow) is created between the two metal plates. This current can be sensed by the smoke detector\u2019s circuitry. When smoke particles enter the chamber, they absorb the alpha particles and become ionized, breaking the circuit and triggering the alarm.            I bought my smoke detectors in second hand shops, both for fifty cents. You can find them sometimes with the hardware. Just make sure it says it contains a radioactive element. If you buy one this way, you will probably be keeping a radioactive substance out of a landfill.Another way to get a smoke detector is to buy one in a store, though they may be a bit pricey.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FIO/BQOK/IMCFCTS9/FIOBQOKIMCFCTS9.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 17: The Twofer: Americium and Neptunium"}, {"step": 18, "steps_text": "Unfortunately most things, including cast iron and wrought iron, are not iron but in fact steel, an alloy of iron and carbon.

The challenge, then, is to find a sample of copper that is interesting.For myself, I wanted a heavy sample so that people lifting it could get an idea of copper\u2019s mass. It also had to be compact enough to fit into my collection, and be interesting to look at. A magnetron, the vacuum tube that produces the microwaves that heat food in a microwave oven, provided me with just the sample I needed. Robbed from a dead microwave, I cut out the copper center portion with a hacksaw. The inside of the tube is evacuated, so the copper surfaces inside are untarnished by air and very peachy, at least for a while. Warning: Some magnetrons have beryllium oxide ceramic insulators, which are dangerous if crushed and inhaled, or otherwise ingested. Whatever you do, never break the ceramic insulators of the magnetron. Broken ceramic insulators or magnetrons should not be directly handled. Also, opening a microwave can be dangerous because they contain high voltage capacitors that can store a lethal charge for some time even after the microwave has been unplugged. To be safe I usually let my microwaves sit around for several months. To be extra safe you can:use tools with insulated handles to do the disassembly    Work using only one arm at a time.

It was a bit difficult for the pliers to grab the edge, but I was able to wrench the coin cell open on one side this way. These batteries can be sealed pretty tight! Next, I was able to grab the edge of the positive half with one pliers and the edge of the negative half with the other, then wrench the two apart.

Bismuth-tin alloy shot is one alternative that provides similar ballistic performance to lead. Many bismuth alloys have low melting points and are found in specialty applications such as solders, as a replacement for traditional tin-lead solders, like in electronics.Many automatic sprinklers, electric fuses, and safety devices in fire detection and suppression systems contain the eutectic In19.1-Cd5.3-Pb22.6-Sn8.3-Bi44.7 alloy that melts at 117 \u00b0F (47 \u00b0C ) Fun with bismuth!High-purity bismuth can form distinctive, colorful hopper crystals. Run an image search for bismuth crystals and see for yourself! The variations in the thickness of the oxide layer that forms on the surface of the crystal causes different wavelengths of light to interfere upon reflection, thus displaying a rainbow of colors. Bismuth is relatively nontoxic and has a low melting point just above 520\u00b0F (271 \u00b0C) , so crystals may be grown using a household stove.

Neon!"}, {"step": 29, "steps_text": "Named after Thor, the Norse god of thunder, Thorium metal is silvery and tarnishes black when exposed to air, forming the dioxide ThO2, also called thoria or thorina.For a sample of thorium we turn to magnetrons, as all magnetrons contain a small amount of thorium (mixed with tungsten) in their filament.according to user dominikK20: \"it actually contains tungsten bits with 2% thorium dioxide. You can add  some 30% H2O2 to them and let that sit for 2 weeks so that all the  tungsten dissolves, then you can get your ThO2 out and reduce it with  magnesium or whatever.\"Why thorium in a magnetron? To understand why, we must understand a little about how a magnetron works.Inside the magnetron, which is evacuated of air to form a vacuum, there are two electrodes. One is the thoriated tungsten center electrode, and the other one is the big cylindrical chunk of copper that has spokes radiating inward from the outside (my copper sample). When a high voltage is applied to both electrodes, the center electrode  becomes very hot and electrons start to \u201cboil\u201d off into the vacuum. Normally the center electrode would have to reach a very high temperature for the electrons to \u201cboil\u201d off like this, but the addition of thorium lowers this temperature. Simply put, the electrons are more willing to make the leap into the vacuum if they get to jump off of thorium atoms! The rest of the filament is tungsten, as tungsten's high melting point prevents it from melting in this instance.Once these electrons are moving freely in the vacuum, they are attracted to the relatively positive outer electrode. However, two big ring magnets located on the outside of the magnetron are generating a mangetic field inside the magnetron that runs parallel to the filament. This causes the electrons to spiral outward from the center electode in a circular path. Now let's consider the outer electrode for a second. See the copper spokes that jut in toward the center? Between them are cavities, and as the electrons spiral outward they brush past the openings of these cavities. Similar to when you blow across the top of a bottle and create a whistling noise, the electrons in the cavities begin to resonate, which causes the electrons to bunch into groups and form waves. These are picked up by an antenna wire attached to the outer electrode and directed through the top of the magnetron tube and into the cooking chamber of your microwave. Thorium-232 is the most stable isotope of thorium (half-life of 14.05 billion years) and accounts for nearly all natural thorium, with the other five natural isotopes occurring only as trace radioisotopes. Thorium-232 decays very slowly through alpha decay to radium-228, starting a decay chain named the thorium series that ends at lead-208. Because thorium decays slowly and only emits alpha particles, it is only weakly radioactive. This makes owning it and even handling small amounts quite safe. The risk of cancer is low, as it never gets airborne in normal usage. Only if the filament is taken out of the magnetron, finely crushed, and inhaled can it pose a health hazard.Other sources of thorium: Thorium is still widely used as an alloying element in TIG welding electrodes (at a rate of 1%\u20132% mix with tungsten)Thorium oxide used to be used in mantles for gas lamps.One question I'd like to know...ARE THE WIRES LEADING INTO THE MAGNETRON MADE OF TUNGSTEN?

Some elements, like the man made ones that have half lives of only a few seconds, can be represented by a picture of the person they are named after, like Albert Einstein for Einsteinium. Other examples of element displays include:Theodore Gray built an actual wooden table shaped like the periodic table, upon which he places samples.Member Kutluhan keeps his in hollowed out pill capsules.If you made it this far, thank you for reading! As you can imagine, I worked hard on this instructable! Here\u2019s how I got started collecting:I first started collecting elements in early 2007, at the age of 14. I was taking apart a cellular phone from 1998, a big black Nokia. Inside I found a piece of magnesium, a metal unlike any I had seen before. It was lightweight, even lighter than aluminum! I looked up magnesium in the encyclopedia and learned that it is highly flammable. Yes, that\u2019s right. Metals can burn, which is something I hadn\u2019t fully realized. Magnesium powder or ribbon is much easier to ignite than a big solid chunk, but once you get it going it burns with an intense white flame that can exceed 5000\u00b0F (3000\u00b0C), as witnessed by a friend of mine that once lived in the southwestern United States. \u201cVolkswagen used to make engines out of magnesium,\u201d he said when I showed him my sample. \u201cWe were out in the desert one night, and some people pulled the engine out of an old Volkswagen and threw it on the fire. It lit up the whole canyon.\u201d Whoa. The elements, as it turns out, are more diverse and interesting than I had originally thought. I began to wonder what other metals I might find by taking things apart. Here are a few that I have found.Taking things apart:Computers:   Aluminum (heat sink, like the one that cools the processor)Gold (circuit board with gold substrate, like RAM cards)Lithium (3V coin cell that powers the CMOS)Microwaves:Barium (getter spot in vacuum fluorescent display, if present)Copper (core section of cavity magnetron)Silicon (large rectifier diode)Coffee Makers, Hair Dryers, Hot Plates, Etc.:Silver (thermal cut off w/ silver plated case and lead wires)Ionization Smoke Detector: Americium and Neptunium (small radioactivebutton inside ionization chamber)I am still working on this instructable!

More than that, they were free, they were wild and they were plentiful. I realized that it presented an opportunity to create my apiary in a traditional way, from building my hives, to creating my own equipment from scratch. Unfortunately, the site I'd secured, on a neighboring farm property fell through, and I was left with 50,000 bees without a home. Luckily, it's not to difficult to find a home for wayward bees, and within a few days they were settled in a nice apiary in the next town.Now there's no shortage of beehive plans online and I really don't have anything new to offer in that regard, however, I did notice that there was very little, in the way, of plans for building a bellows smoker. As it was one of the first (and favorite) items I created, I thought I'd share it with the instructables community.A smoker works by pumping air into a metal canister, via the use of bellows, and forcing the smoke from burning twigs and leaves in a controlled direction. The action of 'smoking' a hive causes an instinctive reaction, in the bees, whereby their natural tendency is to gorge themselves on honey, to the point of lethargy as a defense against forest fires. This makes the bees docile enough to handle, minimizing stinging and aggression.This design is based on the original design, created by Moses Quimby in the 19th century and remains the standard in bee smokers to this day.", "title": "Bellows Bee Smoker for the Home Apiarist", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Bellows-Bee-Smoker-For-The-Home-Apiarist/", "section": "home", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Tools;hack saw/tin snips or wheel cutterhammer and anvilbolt or strong wire cutterssharp knifedrill with bitsstep drill bitSupplies;stainless steel toilet bowl brush holder (dollar store)3-4oz leather patchtack nailsbrass sheet or copper pipe with fittingsempty candy tinlarge springtwo 3.5x6x.25\" pine boardscopper rivets or small nuts and boltsself tapping screwsartist canvas/leather or other dense material", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8B/WEA2/I0ENN4S5/F8BWEA2I0ENN4S5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2U/GB4A/I0ENN4S7/F2UGB4AI0ENN4S7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F23/GIK0/I0ENN4OP/F23GIK0I0ENN4OP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD0/1KEO/I0ENN4JQ/FD01KEOI0ENN4JQ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Tools and Supplies"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "First you need to disassemble the toilet brush canister and remove any plastic. You should be left with a hollow stainless steel tube. Use your saw/tin snips or wheel cutter to cut it down to between 7-8\" long.

I was fortunate enough that the inner diameter of the tin and the outer diameter of the canister were the same size, however you may have to experiment with finding a metal object that fits properly. Once you've fitted your base, use some self tapping metal screws to secure it into place.Don't worry about burning the finish from the tin. The first time you burn material in your smoker should take care of that. Just be sure not to breathe it in or subject your bees to the smoke until its completely gone.You'll need to elevate the material in the canister to allow air underneath so that it burns more evenly. You can achieve this with some expanded metal, cut into a round shape and bent down at the edges. I secured mine by drilling a hole in the base and bolting it down, but it isn't necessary.

I then hammered a lip on its base so that it could be secured to the lid.The lid is constructed out of the old lid from the toilet brush. I used my tin snips to enlarge the existing hole so that the funnel would fit snugly inside, then riveted it into place. I had bought 2 of the toilet brushed to experiment with and ended up creating another outlet using some 1/2\" I.D. copper pipe and fittings. It did work, however  the flow of smoke was limited. Should you opt to go this route, I'd recommend a minimum of 1\" pipe for your outlet.To secure the lid to the canister, I simply created a couple of wire clips that mount to the side main body of the smoker, and latch down over top of the lid. This allows for quick opening of the smoker for lighting and refilling of burnable material.When it was complete, I removed the scratches using my buffing wheel. Keep in mind, however, it will heat up and discolor so there's no real need to make it overly perfect, especially considering we're working with recycled/improvised material. It does, however go a long way to reducing the rough 'recycled' look.**note** if you don't have rivets, you can simply use self tapping screws or small nuts and bolts.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FA6/SOW1/I0ENN4DZ/FA6SOW1I0ENN4DZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9D/JZE2/I0ENN4FH/F9DJZE2I0ENN4FH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE6/MRBH/I0ENN4FY/FE6MRBHI0ENN4FY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7K/W7ZZ/I0ENN4Q8/F7KW7ZZI0ENN4Q8.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Creating Your Outlet Lid"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "The Boards;The bellows are a clever design that uses an air inlet with a one way valve, and an exit valve that blows air out when the bellows are actuated.

This flap will be on the inside of the bellows and will act as the one way valve allowing air in but preventing it from escaping. On the other board, I drilled a 1/2\" hole 1.5\" from the base. I then took the metal tube, that acted as the handle of the toilet brush and pressed it into place. The tube is flared at one end ensuring it doesn't fall out. You can apply a bit of glue around it to ensure it doesn't move.The Spring;The spring allows the bellows to be operated with one hand by keeping them in the open position so that only compression pressure is needed. First I cut a few rounds off of the spring, heated the ends with a torch and straightened them. I then drilled small holes in the ends of the boards for the prongs of the spring to fit into.

After extensive research on this site (thanks guys!) and elsewhere I tried my hand at re-tinning a handful of copper pots I picked up from antique store. I was able to get enough information to get started, but I wouldn't say there was enough to make me feel confident about what I was doing.  Thought I would share my experience for anyone else out there with an interest in bringing an old copper pot or pan back to life that doesn't want to pay $4-6 a square inch (plus shipping) to have a pot professionally re-tinned and isn't afraid of a little molten tin!Why copper? Well, it is the best conductor of heat of any metal used for cooking, 25 times better than stainless steel! That means once the heat hits the pot/pan it heats evenly and immediately. You'll use less heat (I can boil on medium), heat is distributed to the entire pot (no hot spots), and heating will be more responsive. These pots/pans excel at anything that is simmered due to their precise temperature control. Plus, copper just looks amazing!Why a tin lining? For those that don't know, the purpose of lining a copper pot/pan with tin is so that acidic foods (tomato based sauces etc) don't react with bare copper and produce copper oxides, which can make food taste strange and if left for long periods of time can lead to mild poisoning. This copper oxide is also called verdigris, and is that green stuff that you see on the Statue of Liberty, or other copper exposed to the elements. Many new copper pots/pans have a stainless steel lining, which is more durable, but more prone to sticking and less conductive than tin. All really old copper pots have tin linings, and those are the ones you're likely to find sitting in antique shops or thrift stores because they look real grungy and scary to cook in (until you bring them back to life!)What do I look for in an old copper pot? If you find an old copper pot, pay attention to the thickness of the walls and the overall weight as these indicate the quality of its construction. Thickness generally ranges from 1mm (more of a display piece) to over 3mm thick (a serious professional/hotel kitchen item). The heavier the pot/pan, the better. It should feel hefty and solid when you pick it up. Really old copper pots often have a brazed \"dovetail\" or \"finger\" joints where the hammered copper sheet was joined together, later models were made using industrial machinery to spin or form them without joints. If you find an old copper pot on craigslist or ebay, be sure to ask how much it weighs, that'll give you a good idea if it's worth what they are asking.Can I do this? While your results definitely won't be as good as having a pro do a hand wiped tinning on the first try (there are several places out there that will do this for you, East Coast Tinning and Rocky Mountain Retinning to name a few), it will definitely be functional. In the end, I decided that since my pots are really old hand hammered and dovetailed pieces of art, I didn't mind if my tin lining isn't totally smooth. These are items that can take a beating, mine are at least 100 years old, and still have a lot of life left in them.

The acid will eat away any left over carbon build up, grease, and will soften/eat away at the dull tin that is left on the inside of the pot.  After an hour I took out the pot and gave them a good rinse, the muriatic acid will change the color of the copper to a light pink (unless there is lots of patina and gunk still stuck on there, which sometimes discolors it a bit).

To avoid getting tin on the outside of your pot you can put \"whiting\" on there (powdered chalk with a little water works I'm told). I personally skipped this step and didn't have too many problems with dripping tin on the outside.PRO TIP - To get the tin flowing over a wide area more easily you can also pre-heat your copper pot in an over at 450. If you choose to do this I wouldn't apply flux until the next step when you are out of doors. I've done this with a pre-heat and without, both turned out fine.  SAFETY FIRST. Wear a long sleeve shirt, long pants, and closed toed shoes. The pan will be really hot, as will the tin and you don't want it touching your bare skin. HAVE A RESPIRATOR, EYE PROTECTION AND LEATHER GLOVES. If you use sal ammoniac as your flux it will create a thick white smoke when heated, and from what I hear it will rust anything it touches. Also, not good to breath in since it is corrosive, so use a good respirator mask. Bring your fluxed pot outside (DO NOT DO THIS INSIDE ON YOUR STOVE). I used a propane turkey fryer as a heat source on a medium heat. Put your copper pot on there and slowly heat it.      PRO TIP - Since copper both gains and loses heat quickly you can create a basic brazing hearth using fire bricks. Just lay them our around the flame of your propane burner, google around and you'll get the idea.  The flux allows the tin to stick to the inside of the pot. If using Stay Clean, watch for it to start to get a little dark on the metal while I'm over the fire, and then start spreading on the tinIf using Sal Ammoniac, once the white smoke starts billowing throw in a small piece of tin, or rub some tin bar around the bottom of the pot. If the pot is hot enough (456 degrees or so) the tin will melt right away and turn liquid. Swirl the molten tin around and rub the molten tin on the inside of the pot/pan with your plumbers wad (be sure you have gloves on). You can also use tongs to hold the plumbers wad/wiping cloth so you don't have to get your hands anywhere near the hot pan, probably not a bad idea.  You may have to heat the sides of the pan separately to get the copper hot enough for the tin to bond there. Where the handle meets the pot will also require additional heat (as the handle acts as a heat sink).  Trial and error will play a part. As you are heating you will see when the old tin lining melts, as it starts to get shiny and change color where the heat is applied. Know that you can always cool the pan down, clean it, flux it, and then remelt the tin. It took me a couple of tries to get it right.  You can let the pan cool down naturally, or use the assistance of a 5 gallon bucket of water. Be careful not to dunk the hot copper into cold water immediately, as this could warp your pot/pan.

I had to move the pot around, and heat the sides to get the tin flowing.  A little heat goes a long way, so don't use too much heat or you'll end up burning your plumbers wad/wiping cloth and then burned bits may keep some areas from bonding. A plumbers torch would have been handy for more accurate heating.  Worst case scenario you start at the beginning and do it all over again. In fact, on a few pots I did the bottom very successfully, but the sides not as well. I just went back and scrubbed, pickled, and rinsed before going back to do the sides a second time.

Yeah that's right, 1799! He really drops some knowledge, so below is his full text, with the second tinning step in bold. \"That copper and brass vessels cannot be used with safety in cooking victuals or for holding articles of food, and particularly those which contain acids, is well known. It is also well known that the tinning applied in the usual manner is not durable, being soon worn away by cleaning, and on that account must be frequently renewed. Some, therefore, have proposed enameling for kitchen utensils of copper ; which, indeed, would answer exceedingly well, and be much safer for the health than impure tin mixed with lead, often employed for tinning ; but, unfortunately, enamel is too dear, and readily breaks when the vessel receives the least blow ; which cannot al ways be avoided. The following process for tinning is attended with no danger from poisonous ingredients, as no lead is used in it; the tinning, too, is exceedingly durable, adds strength to the copper vessel and secures it from the action of acids much longer than the common tinning. When the vessel has been prepared and cleaned in the usual manner, it must be roughened on the inside by being beat on a rough anvil, in order that the tinning may hold better, and be more intimately connected with the copper. The process of tinning must then be begun with perfectly pure grained tin, having an addition of sal ammoniac instead of the common colophonium.Over this tinning, which must cover the copper in an even and uniform, manner throughout, a second harder coat must be applied, as the first forms only a kind of medium for connecting the second with the copper. For this second tinning you employ pure grained tin, mixed with zinc in the proportion of two to three, which must be applied also with sal ammoniac smooth and even, so that the lower stratum may be entirely covered with it. This coating, which by the addition of the zinc, becomes pretty hard and solid, is then to be hammered with a smoothing hammer, after it has been properly rubbed and scoured with chalk and water, by which it becomes more solid, and acquires a smooth compact surface. Vessels and utensils may be tinned in this manner on both sides. In this case, after being exposed to a sufficient heat, they must be dipped in the fluid tin, by which means both sides will be tinned at the same time.

Kohl is even put on children out of tradition or to protect their eyes from ailments as well as the \"evil eye\" curse.\nTraditionally, kohl was made in marathon sessions of what was pretty much lots of soot collection where brass or copper plates/bowls were placed over oil lamps, mixed with a some ghee or oil and stowed away in a box. A little goes a long way with kohl, and one making would last a very long time if stored correctly. There were many variations of kohl-making but they all seem to\u00a0 involve:\n1) Something to burn and keep it burning\n2) A flame\n3) Some collective surface\n4) Something added to make the kohl smooth and glide-able.\nFor a long time a big problem with kohl was it was made of crushed\u00a0 galena aka lead sulfide which was causing plenty of lead poisoning. Besides that, who knows what else goes in to commercial kohl? This process of making it yourself makes it possible to monitor exactly what's going on to your face, because you have the choice in the matter from beginning to end.\nOf course those with sensitive eyes or eye complications should probably get doctor approval when it comes to such homemade cosmetics.\n((First instructable, yay here we go!))", "title": "Creating \"Authentic\" Kohl/Kajal Makeup From Scratch", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Creating-Authentic-non-toxic-KohlKajal-Makeup-fr/", "section": "home", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The first component you need for your home made kohl is something to burn.\nIf you are looking to go super traditional, you can go ahead and pick up a brass oil lamp (a mud lamp even, for max traditionality),\u00a0 and your choice of sesame oil, castor oil, canola oil, or any plant oil that likes to be on fire.\nThen comes the wick, which is made of clean muslin/ cotton cloth. Naturally no synthetic or used fabrics, I'm sure somehow that laundry detergent and other contaminants come off of recycled cloth as it is burned. But hey, its all up to you. I made my wick from a cut of cotton that was about 5inx3in and that was a bit too thick when twisted up for my makeshift lamp (basically just the bottom of the above lamp with its glass shade taken off.)

This is a very simple and effective bit of kit that is also reasonably safe compared to the alternatives.

It also has an automatic lock out switch if the distiller runs dry.There are no naked flames, no exposed heater elements, no running water, no electrical contact relays and lots of air circulation caused by the fan to blow away alcohol fumes. I'm not saying it's perfect, but there have been no reported accidents, as far as I know (Nov. 2016).Paradoxically, to produce a safe product, a hazardous caustic chemical called sodium hydroxide or 'lye' needs to be used. This can be substituted with sodium bicarbonate if wanted, but a far greater quantity will be required to be effective.The alcohol from an Air Still will never be fantastically pure, but will have plenty of interesting flavours due to the fact that the condenser is very close to the actual heating chamber, with little opportunity for reflux in the connecting pipework.", "title": "How to Distill Alcohol", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Distill-Alcohol/", "section": "food", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Air StillpH paper      Sodium hydroxide (pearl not flake), or sodium bicarbonate     Alcohol meterHydrometer      Thermometer      Conductivity Meter eg PRIMO Pocket TDS Tester (0 to 1999ppm)      Gloves and Goggles      Scales (0 to 50g)50ml measuring cylinder      15mm copper pipe cut into 15mm sections x 20 of      3 litre receiver for alcohol produced      Glass storage bottles    Brita Water Filter", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSH/CWF7/IVO4MZH1/FSHCWF7IVO4MZH1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8P/5ZH9/IVO4MZIT/F8P5ZH9IVO4MZIT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9G/0MOJ/IVO4N01C/F9G0MOJIVO4N01C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXH/H59F/IVO4RGX7/FXHH59FIVO4RGX7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIU/P2H2/IVO4RH01/FIUP2H2IVO4RH01.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Equipment"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Potential hazards:Alcohol vapour explosion       Alcohol liquid fire       Heavy metal poisoning eg copper       Sulphurous acid / sulphide poisoning       Methanol poisoning       Electric shock       Irresponsible drinking      Alcohol addiction       Sodium hydroxide burns       User error       Drinking alcohol above 60% concentrationThere should be no naked flames, electrical switching devices, hot surfaces or even mobile phones in the room.

If the pH is less than 6, using gloves and goggles, add pearls of sodium hydroxide to the brew and stir until the pH level actually reaches 6. Some home brew can be quite acidic eg pH 3.0 and it's a good idea to try and weigh the pearls used to make it easier for the next batch. If the brew is acidic, it's quite likely that natural sulphides will turn into sulphurous acid vapour, which will react with metals such as copper to produce copper sulphate, which is poisonous.       Add the copper pipe segments to the still boiler - this is a fall back, just in case something went wrong in step 2 above. The idea is that any remaining acid will react with the copper and the copper sulphate produced will stay in the boiler rather than evaporate.       Add the brew to the boiler, no higher than the line gouged on the inside.       Place a 50ml measuring cylinder under the output spout and turn on the still, ensuring there is plenty of ambient ventilation eg open doors and windows etc.       Collect the first 30ml of distillate and discard it as it will be rich in methanol, which is poisonous. Technically, this is called the 'Heads Cut' and can be adjusted for different desired flavours. Some brews will require a greater heads cut to remove other chemicals such as aldehydes, ketones, esters etc.       Place a large 3 litre 'receiver' jug under the output spout and collect the main run.       Measure the alcohol content using the alcoholmeter every 15 minutes and stop the process when it reaches 40%. Never drink alcohol if it is above 60%. The exact point at which distillation is stopped depends on the flavour profile required - carry on for longer and more oily 'Fusils' will be produced which can give interesting flavours but more chance of a hangover!  If the product is cloudy, this is probably copper soaps hanging in suspension in the fluid and so should be redistilled.  Test the alcohol with pH paper - it should be pH 6.0 and test the conductivity - it should be about a maximum of 10 ppm. If the pH was low there might be sulphurous acid present and if the conductivity was high there might be heavy metal contamination, again, poisonous.      If there is a problem at stage 9 above, pour the product through a Britvic water filter, which contains ion exchange resins and activated carbon for removing chemicals and repeat the test.

This is far more difficult than it sounds and actually 'tasting' is probably the single most difficult part of the whole process! When tasting, we need to have a clean palette ie no food or drink other than water in the last hour. First we swill the glass and then carefully smell the vapours - what do we notice? Then we taste the product - what other flavours are there present? Is anything too dominant? Are there any subtle flavours lingering in the background that need to be enhanced at all?Experienced, professional, tasters experience a drink like ordinary people might experience a piece of music or a work of visual art. This skill can, however, easily be leant. A useful technique is to use sensory deprivation - blind fold yourself and use ear plugs - sit in a chair for a whole hour doing nothing and then carefully drink some of the product, making a mental note of the range and intensity of the different flavours. Also, ask some of your friends to do the same - it could be fun!Tasting is divided into 3 parts - the smell, the main taste and the aftertaste. A good example of aftertaste is saffron. Drink something with this spice in it and you will experience the most amazing aftertaste that lingers for about 5 minutes!

distillation is actually quite simple. the hard part is making sure you are getting ethanol and not methanol (or the like). in this instructable i will show how i made a wash, fermented it, and consequently--the most important part--how i distilled it. i have added more specifics in order to answer some of the most asked questions i've gotten in the comments.\u00a0 i hope this helps. i might

more options are available for different flavor characteristics.\u00a0 for instance, if you ferment molasses you will end up with rum.\u00a0 if you ferment blue agave you will end up with tequila. i was looking for simplicity for a beginner and ran with this.  it is the easiest to procure and make.  unfortunately white sugar creates a decidedly cidery flavor to the spirit, but much of that can be distilled out or masked by flavoring or blending.    \nthe wash (fermentable solution, a.k.a. sugar water) was then poured into a clean carboy (big glass bottle, see pic).  after that i 'pitched' the

gas stoves, basically anything they could get their hands on.  dangerous!  play it safe.  open flames are not good around a still. alcohol vapors are flammable!  as well, precise temperature control of your heat source is not necessary.  the solution will take care of that.  electric heat is the best.  \ncheck the pic.  i'm using an electric stove.  works great.  you can see how i have it set up and i hope it all makes sense now.  you load your wash into the kettle/pot, apply some heat, and condense the results.\u00a0 how?\u00a0 i'll tell you if you'd just be patient.\u00a0 geez.\nokay, pour your wash into the kettle.  place the stopper into the spout.  turn on the heat.  watch the thermometer.  alcohol boils at a temperature lower than water.  that's what makes distillation work.  exact temperature will vary depending on elevation and barometric pressure, but water boils at around 212 \u00b0F while ethanol boils at around 173 \u00b0F.\u00a0 methanol, that can make you blind and is what you really want to avoid, boils around 148 \u00b0F.  while running your wash, watch for plateaus (when the temperature stays the same for a while -- forms a plateau if you graph it) on your thermometer and compare them to known boiling temperatures to ensure you get only what you want and leave the rest.  check out my instructable to give you the basics of distillation.\nbasically if you begin to distill and the temperature reaches a certain point and remains there for any length of time you have reached the boiling temperature for a particular liquid component of your wash.  check the temperature against the boiling point data you have researched and you can tell what it is you are distilling at the time.  using this information you can discard anything other than ethanol.  no matter what a solution contains, it will not boil at a temperature any higher than what the level of the component with the lowest boiling temperature is until that component is boiled away.  check the comments or 'distilling basics' for a discussion or two on this.\nas an example, if your solution contains methanol, ethanol and water it will happen like this: once the temperature of your solution reaches around 148 \u00b0F methanol will begin to boil and come out through your tube as vapor into your condenser where it will convert back to liquid and exit into your receptacle.\u00a0 the temperature of your solution will not vary much beyond 148 \u00b0F until the methanol is gone and then will begin to climb again until it reaches 173 \u00b0F, the boiling point of the ethanol.\u00a0 the same thing will happen here.\u00a0 the temperature will hover around the same until the ethanol is boiled off and then on to water.\u00a0 \nin order to get ethanol and exclude the rest you get rid of what are called the 'heads' and 'tails.' basically dump anything that boils lower than around 173 \u00b0F and everything after the temperature begins to climb again.\u00a0 this is why i mentioned having more than one receptacle. use one for the heads, one for what you want, and one for the tails.\nso once you've boiled off and then condensed your wash, you should be left with a solution containing a much higher alcohol content than what you started with.\u00a0  you will still get a bit of water, but that's okay.  running the product through the still again will further extract ethanol and raise the proof.  \na bit of trivia: the Xes often seen on moonshine bottles in old cartoons, etc. represent the amount of runnings, or how many times it was distilled.\ni've achieved a blue flame from a wash after a first run with this set up.  you may or may not need to run the wash more than once.  anything over about 150 proof will burn.\u00a0 that's a pretty good result from a single run.\ni do not recommend doing anything i've talked about.  it's not very legal (in the US), and it's not very safe.  i enjoy knowledge for the sake of knowledge, though, and just because i know how to do something doesn't mean i will.  so take this to heart, and take care.  \npeace.\n-p", "step_imgs":

I have found it easier to cut and weld in pairs, in other words cut two rods and weld two rods, repeat to conclusion.\nTo weld it all together, I it\u2019s easier to keep the rods that I used to make the gap in the marking stage to keep the rods parallel and to an even spacing, just been careful not to weld those rods to the backbone. I also keep the guide in the botton to make sure that the rod Im welding it's centered, and be carful not to move the center rod from its place in the guide.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FCX/SJTW/H9X3HKQB/FCXSJTWH9X3HKQB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPA/RRVH/H9X3HKQ9/FPARRVHH9X3HKQ9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOA/VY58/H9T4QHNL/FOAVY58H9T4QHNL.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Cutting and Welding the Grill"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "I wanted to give the grill a more solid feeling so I weld two more backbones to it.

To make it easier to weld, I chose a width that\u2019s exactly the outer distance between two rods, so I can deform a little bit the handle and pressure place it.

It is better to cut it longer and not shorter, because you can always cut it again.\nThen I used a flat screw driver to remove the knob from the burner. I just ply between the knob and the burner wall, and the knob just slide out. As you can see in the pictures, the shape of the rod is a circle with a straight cut.

Then I turn my extension around in the lathe and sized down the diameter to the diameter of hole in the new know, and a length of the depth of the hole.\nThen I mounted the extension on a vise and with the help of a file I made the flat surface so the new knob can slide in tight enough. Finally I used a hand drill to make a hole perpendicular to the one in the end of the extension that goes from side to side. To choose the drill bit size I used a thread table in combination with the thread tap and the screw I\u2019m going to used to fix the extension to the burner rod.

A lot of my friends drink Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey and I already have built a still, the instructable is here for how I built it, you will need one like this which is a Pot Still. The point is I was looking for a project to keep me busy and even though I don't drink JD my self I thought I would have a stab at making it my self just for the challenge. there is a lot of information from peoples how\u00a0 to recipes for bourbon or Tennessee Whiskey but I wanted JD so I spent over a\u00a0 month most of my evenings looking in to how to make it and trying to find as much information about JD's actual method and I found various articles and video snippets with fragments of information from people who work at the JD Distillery. Thanks to that information I have gathered I have come up with a way to produce this my self at home as close to how they make it as is practically possible for my self. Just a bit of a heads up because I wanted to document this so well I have taken tons of pictures, so there is a lot of images but I am hoping that wont be a bad thing as they are all good quality. well except the video on charcoal which went weird at the beginning because of youtubes codecs for some reason. This instructable is the result of a few months of research, over 2 months of experimenting, a botched attempt or 2 and a fair sum of money just to get it right...... and i don't even drink the stuff! You don't have to spend a lot of money your self to make it, the ingredients and the process does not cost a lot if you have the equipment already, but I had to do a few runs and I spent a fair bit extra to put it in nice bottles and present it well which can be great for gifts.

Barley Malt, or Pale Malt which is the same thing. you can make your own Barley Malt by putting barley in to a cloth sack and submerging it in water for a few days and letting it sprout then removing it when the shoots are about 1 inch long, dry it then grind it. but why bother when you can just buy it. got this on ebay but they sell it in homebrew stores. Yeast, I used a yeast called EC-1118 which is a wine / campaign yeast but it was recommended by white labs as one that can be used, if you want to white labs do supply 2 yeasts that can be used as well one called Tennessee Whiskey Yeast and the other is American Bourbon Yeast. they also do an American whiskey yeast. in the UK you can use the wilkinsons wine yeast which is EC-1118 even though it doesnt say that it is, i emailed them to find out and it is EC-1118. otherwise lalvin make a EC-1118 and it can be bought in most homebrew shops The amounts of these vary depending on what you are making so have a look at the recipe's on the next step.filtering and aging Sugar Maple Charcoal, or sugar maple chips which you can make in to charcoal which I will show you later in this instructable. this is for the filtering, if you want to make Kentucky Bourbon you wont be needing this as its not filtered through Charcoal.

But with less rye the Tennessee whiskey is slightly sweeter. ok some information on the yeast, Jack Daniel's has their own yeast which I could not for love nor money find out what strain it was, most distillery's closely guard their yeast strains. by using a different yeast the flavor will be effected but there is not much I can do about this. As i said on the previous step there is some yeasts produced by white labs which have been designed for Bourbons and Tennessee whiskey, I choose the EC-1118 as it is very easy to get hold of, the ones from white labs you can get from home brew shops but I have found they will only special order it in for you and I just wanted to get on with it. I may try them out at some point to see if they do make a difference on the flavor of the produced spirit.Technical Terms Mash, this is the cooked mixture of the grain water beer. this is the mash without the grain in it, but with the yeast added back set, bourbon and Tennessee whiskey have a legal requirement of having at least 25% back set in the mash to class it as a sour mash. what does this mean? well back set is the water left in the still after you have distilled a batch. we wont have this for the first batch and there is not much we can do about that. but the next batch you will have it as long as you keep it from the first lot. if you are going to leave it a while to make some more then bottle it up and let is cool then freeze it. defrost it when you are going to make your next batch, let it get to room temp before adding it.Something Fun ok so part of my research in to JD I came across something interesting, no one who works for JD knows why its called old number 7. the only person who knows is Jasper (Jack) Daniel and he died in the 1800's . there is various storys but one that makes the most sense is that they sent 7 barrels on the rail road to some conference a few 100 miles away. they then get told that the barrels have gone missing so they send another 7 barrels. in the mean time the original 7 barrels turned up so the railroad workers wrote \"old 7\" on them and sent them back to the distillery.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FGH/FIVC/HQA0AK5D/FGHFIVCHQA0AK5D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV5/GFLE/HQA0AK55/FV5GFLEHQA0AK55.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Recipe, Info and Techical Terms"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "\n          Now we know what we stuff we need to cook the mash it's time to do it. Now depending on how you do this stage will depend on how long you need. I only had a 6L saucepan so I had to make 4 batches and that took me most of a day. if you are lucky enough to have a very large pot then you can do it all in one batch. However I have heard of people with large pans who end up burning/scorching the mash because they cant effectively stir it all the way to the bottom, that being said it took me 12 hours to cook all the mash to fill 1 fermenter. to avoid burning or scorching you need to keep the mixture moving so that its not on the bottom for too long at a time, you can't just chuck the stuff in and leave it. also you don't want to cook it too fast as this will also burn it and it wont liquify the starch in the corn, or it will in some of it but not all of it. for my method I realized it saved time to cook a batch and then put it in a fermenter while it cooled so I could get on with the next one and save time. so you want to clean a fermenter and sterilize it before you start cooking if you are going to do more than one batch. just clean the fermenter with dish soap and hot water, rinse it out with clean water then put some sterilizing powder in and some hot water. pop the lid on and shake it (make sure the airlock is in so the pressure can escape) shake it gingerly. I would advise you at this point to make a coffee/tea and make sure you have been to the toilet/bathroom, make sure you will not be disturbed as once you have started a batch you cant stop even for a few seconds otherwise it will burn. In a 6L pot put around 3L of water and a portion of the back set from the previous run if you have any. Weigh out your stuff, if you are making 4 batches just divide the amounts by 4 so 1300g of corn, 125g rye and 200g barley malt. slowly add the corn while stirring it in, this will stop it clumping. if you put the corn in warm water it will clump up and then it wont cook properly. Bring the corn to the boil, around 90 degrees C slowly, this will liquify the starch in the corn, keep it moving so that is does not burn to the bottom. when its at the boil keep it there for about at least 1 hour then remove it from the heat and turn the burner off. if you are using a saucepan with a encapsulated base you will need to keep stirring it for a few more minutes as they tend to keep cooking it for a few minutes. During the cooking you may notice it gets gummy as the starch liquify's, have a kettle of hot water on stand by and just pour some of that in there now and then to top up the liquids that evaporate off, you should end up with about 5L or more in the pot. while it is cooling stir it now and then, when it gets to 76.6 degrees C (170 F) add in the rye and stir it in, put the heat on really low to hold the temp for about 20 minutes to allow the rye to soak and break down. turn off the heat and leave it to cool more. as it cools you will notice it become like mash potato. while it is cooling stir it now and then, when it gets to about 66 Degrees C (148 F) add in the malted barley, you will have to do this a little at a time and stir it in before adding the next bit. what the malted barley actually does is to convert the starch from the corn in to useable sugars that the yeast can use later. the malted barley has an enzyme in it which converts the starch. As you stir it in you will notice its becomes easier and easier and more and more liquid. Leave the mix for 10 minutes so the barley has time to soak, then move it to the fermenter grains and all, with some warm water rinse the pot out and pour that in the fermenter, you only want about half a cup of water. NOTE: some home brewers use an enzyme they bought from a pharmacy called beano which helps to convert starch to sugars, they use this in addition to the barley malt. I have not used this as its not what Jack Daniels do, so its not what I will do. also don't panic about it not bubbling quickly, it takes a little time for the yeast to get going.  \u00a0", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8N/6I7B/HQA0ANID/F8N6I7BHQA0ANID.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC2/G17I/HQA0ANIG/FC2G17IHQA0ANIG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCG/QOIS/HQA0ANIM/FCGQOISHQA0ANIM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKL/3YUF/HQA0ANIV/FKL3YUFHQA0ANIV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG9/AQKL/HQQLNE0W/FG9AQKLHQQLNE0W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVN/3ZK4/HQA0ANIY/FVN3ZK4HQA0ANIY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP5/47NO/HQA0ANJ1/FP547NOHQA0ANJ1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM1/IKTC/HQA0ANJ6/FM1IKTCHQA0ANJ6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4D/ABJB/HQA0ANJF/F4DABJBHQA0ANJF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW6/G539/HQA0ANJI/FW6G539HQA0ANJI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXK/V4NZ/HQA0ANJL/FXKV4NZHQA0ANJL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBR/G90B/HQA0ANJQ/FBRG90BHQA0ANJQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5X/Y8S8/HQA0ANMT/F5XY8S8HQA0ANMT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9G/RYJT/HQA0ANN0/F9GRYJTHQA0ANN0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZK/XV9R/HQA0ANN9/FZKXV9RHQA0ANN9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP9/R0DZ/HQA0ANNH/FP9R0DZHQA0ANNH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN2/Y0H3/HQA0ANY1/FN2Y0H3HQA0ANY1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP9/XUXI/HQA0ANY7/FP9XUXIHQA0ANY7.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Cooking the Mash"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "now we need to move the mash over to the other fermenter and filter out the grain. to filter the grain i used a coat hanger and a colander so that the colander sits on there properly on the fermenter, this will catch anything that over spills, put a sieve in there. now just use a jug and put a just of mash in the filter, then when the liquid has gone, pour some warm water over the grains to get the remaining starches out, just a trickle. Remove the grains from the sieve, put them outside for the birds or something, then put the next jug through, and keep going until you have finished. For those thinking of just putting a cloth in the colander, I tried this out and the cloth just got clogged up and it was taking ages, so I figured that the small bits will all sink to the bottom so as long as I don't suck up the sediment when I transfer it to the still later it shouldn't be an issue. if you do not have over 23L in your fermenter you should top it up, I would pour more water in over the grains and get every last bit of starch you can get out of them. Using a hydrometer from a home brew store you can check what the SG (specific gravity) which should be between 1.050 and 1.065, plain water should be around 1.000 so this tells us that there is a decent amount of sugars in there which will be turned in to alcohol. my first batch only had an SG of 1.025 and this was because I didn't cook the corn for an hour so i had to scrap it and start a new batch. if you think your SG is low there is not much you can do about it, other than cheat, I didn't do this because I wanted to get it right but if you want to, then here's what to do, get some sugar and dissolve it in hot water and add it to the fermenter and stir it, check the SG and keep adding until its high enough for you. but do this with caution, it will effect the flavor if you push it too high. Depending on what yeast you are using you need to wait until the beer is within the range for that yeast. for EC-1118 it has to be below about 30 degrees C but above 10 degrees C , I have found it works better at the top end on other ferments I have done so I will aim for around 22 - 25 degrees C. Once its within the operating temp of the yeast all I have to do is pitch it, seal the top, making sure you have an airlock in it to stop external stuff getting in and infecting your beer. Put some water in the air lock and keep it in a warm place where the temp stays within the tolerances of the yeast. something to consider here is where you keep your fermenter, the reason I say this is because it will bubble through the air lock which sometimes can be annoying, but also some yeasts give off smelly gases. I have used some bread yeasts in other ferments that made it smell like it was rotting, but it wasn't it was just the gas's given off. EC-1118 in previous ferments did not smell too bad. it will take anything from 5 to 10 days to ferment, you will know when its done by the airlock, if it stops bubbling it is probably done, you can check it by popping the lid off and see if the surface bubbles have stopped. don't open the lid too often as every time you do you allow air from outside to come in which could bring an infection with it and then you will have mold on your beer and it will be useless. be patient! you may find that bubbling takes a while to start as well, do not worry this is normal mine took nearly 24 hours before it was noticeably bubbling, up until then I could stand there for 5 minutes watching the airlock and nothing would happen. When it stops bubbling leave it one more day int eh warm and then move it to some where cold ideally below 10 degrees C, this still force the yeast to stop working and sink to the bottom, we do not want yeast in the still if we can help it as it would ruin the taste, the finishing SG should be 1.000 or lower which tells you its finished. TIP: another thing that could be done with the grain is mix it up in another fermenter with 4kg of white sugar and boiling water, add a little yeast nutrient from the brew shop. pop in some yeast and ferment it out then distill it for some cheaper corn style whiskey. age it and filter it in the same way. but keep it separate it wont be as good as the original batch.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FI6/ZVN4/HQA0AOAS/FI6ZVN4HQA0AOAS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0Z/78SD/HQAB7ZTC/F0Z78SDHQAB7ZTC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F11/0LFW/HQAB7ZU7/F110LFWHQAB7ZU7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F53/PZ7O/HQAB7ZUF/F53PZ7OHQAB7ZUF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2D/43UQ/HQAB7ZV7/F2D43UQHQAB7ZV7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS4/WK87/HQAB7ZW7/FS4WK87HQAB7ZW7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRP/97U2/HQAB7ZX8/FRP97U2HQAB7ZX8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFM/SW3K/HQAB7ZY6/FFMSW3KHQAB7ZY6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCV/LT45/HQAB7ZZL/FCVLT45HQAB7ZZL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW4/J9XV/HQAB800U/FW4J9XVHQAB800U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQH/FDOH/HQEA4C4Q/FQHFDOHHQEA4C4Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY9/04ML/HQEA4CBQ/FY904MLHQEA4CBQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F08/17KZ/HQSV2PTS/F0817KZHQSV2PTS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7E/6B3L/HQS4YYH1/F7E6B3LHQS4YYH1.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Moving the Mash to the Final Fermenter and Fermenting"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "If you are making Kentucky Bourbon then you can skip this step and the making the filter step as well as Kentucky Bourbon is not filtered, only Tennessee Whiskey is filtered through Maple. You can filter other spirits through charcoal to mellow them out so its still worth knowing. first things first we need to choose some wood, for this I am using maple, if you can get it use sugar maple which is what Jack Daniels use for their charcoal. You will need some paint cans, I'm using 2.5L empty cans which I bought on ebay, it was the only place I could find them, I tried all over the place, paint suppliers, decorators warehouses, DIY stores the only place I didn't try was auto spray shops and the reason I mention it is the ebay user I bought the cans off aimed their advert at auto spray shops so if you are having trouble finding cans try their first. its best to buy empty paint cans rather than use old paint cans as you may contaminate the wood which would in turn work its way in to your spirit and you don't want to drink that. I made sure my cans didn't have a painted surface on the inside, the outside didn't matter as thats not in contact with the wood and it will get burnt off anyway. you need to punch or drill a hole in the lid, if you are drilling it use a center punch to put a dent in the lid and then use a drill to make a small hole. this hole is important as it lets the gases escape, if you don't put a hole in you are creating a pressure vessel which is VERY dangerous. make sure your pieces and not tiny but are also not really big as we want to create little pebbles of charcoal in the end, so making sure the wood starts off roughly the right size to start with is good, you will get some shrinkage. i filled the cans with all the bits that were the right size first then I used a small hand axe to split the pieces left over to roughly the right size. Make sure there is no bark on your wood, if there is remove it, this will not make good charcoal, also remove any wispy bits as well. put the can at an angle of around 45 degrees on your lap and start to lay in the wood, you don't want to tightly pack it as you want the gases to be able to escape around the wood. fill it almost all the surface but leave around an inch of the last part. and do this for another can if you have more until you have used up your chips. I used 4 cans,for 2kg of maple, and ended up putting a few on the top as well in each can. the main point is that the can is around half full, again to allow the gases to escape. Put the lid on nice and tight, and if the handles on your cans are plastic you will need to remove these you dont want plastic in the fire it stinks, it could contaminate your wood and its toxic.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWJ/GQ5F/HQDUT9O4/FWJGQ5FHQDUT9O4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBO/NQPN/HQDUT9O5/FBONQPNHQDUT9O5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBE/7STB/HQF9G448/FBE7STBHQF9G448.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGF/W4OD/HQF9G44A/FGFW4ODHQF9G44A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ6/0OHF/HQEA4HY3/FJ60OHFHQEA4HY3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8X/UVXP/HQEA4I0I/F8XUVXPHQEA4I0I.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQD/UX7Y/HQF9G44U/FQDUX7YHQF9G44U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEF/L5CX/HQEA4I7S/FEFL5CXHQEA4I7S.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWE/23CA/HQF9G44V/FWE23CAHQF9G44V.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC3/OJ2K/HQF9G44X/FC3OJ2KHQF9G44X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRO/TS99/HQDUT9OI/FROTS99HQDUT9OI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F93/07UN/HQF9G454/F9307UNHQF9G454.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F33/Y9M6/HQDUT9OJ/F33Y9M6HQDUT9OJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZQ/AEBX/HQEA4IRK/FZQAEBXHQEA4IRK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Preparing to Make Charcoal"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "\n          We need\u00a0 to build a fire, if you have a fire pit then you could use this or an incinerator or steel drum. build a fire with some scrap wood, you may want to scrounge some pallets or something, I had an old pine bed frame hanging around so I chopped it up to smaller bits using my chop saw / table saw, i also filled up another paint can with bits of the untreated pine and made some pine charcoal while\u00a0 I had the fire going I thought I might as well which I will use for firework making at a later time. I think most people know how to start a fire, put some paper or something down and put small bits of wood on top of it and light it, simple then when the wood is alight add more wood. simple, we want to have a fair amount of embers to heat our cans so add enough wood to create a decent layer of embers/coals. Should you have any issues getting your fire going try using a hair dryer to push air in to the fire and that should get the wood to catch nicely. once you have enough embers you can put the cans on, but space them out a little we want the heat to get around all of them. it doesn't matter if some of the wood is still burning with flame in fact you may want to put some more on around the cans to keep the heat up, which is what i did. Make sure you put the cans in so the hole is at the top and do not block the hole so the gases can escape. now it's a waiting game, eventually you will start to see steam and smoke coming from the cans, and eventually the gases released from the wood will catch fire. once that dies down and there is no smoke or flames, use a spade to remove the cans from the fire do one at a time, and wear heavy duty gloves, i used my welding gauntlets. And you want to turn the cans over and put them on the grass or dirt so the air can't get through the hole. the finished result I was very pleased with, it fully burnt up, I had concerns that it wouldn't all burn. because I cut the pieces thin to start with they turned out very easy to snap between my fingers which is great for the next step. it took me around 30 minutes to build up a decent fire before I put the can in, and about 45 minutes to an hour to do one can, and the same time to do the other 2 cans which I did at the same time. I used latex gloves to keep my hands clean, took the lid off with a screw driver and put the charcoal in to a biscuit tin for use later.

We want to filter the spirit through as much charcoal as we can get away with so I will be making my filter at least 5 feet long, and have over 4 feet of that charcoal. Jack Daniels have their charcoal in large tanks and spray the spirit over it, but we wont be able to do that because we wont have enough charcoal or enough spirit to make that possible. To get around this we can restrict the diameter of the filter by using a 1 inch PVC pipe and we will trickle the spirit through it, the key is not to just dump it in there and let it run out, we need to control the rate in which it goes through to get the best out of our filter. what we want is a tube full of charcoal and the idea of this is that the charcoal will filter out all the tiny particles in the spirit and mellow the spirit out. basically he impurity's get caught in the little cracks in the charcoal. wait for your charcoal to cool down and then you can break it up in to smaller pieces as pictured, use latex gloves to keep your hands clean. I snapped the pieces of charcoal by hand, and now and then you will come across one you cant break small enough and i used some pliers to break them. we are aiming for pieces around 1cm or smaller but not tiny or in to dust. we want to maximize the surface area of the charcoal and breaking it up will do this. I need to control the flow into the filter for 2 reasons, 1) I dont want to fill the tube up and have the charcoal float on the top, and 2) i want to gradually release the whiskey through it so we get the maximum out of the charcoal. To do this i decided to take a plastic valve from a home brew siphon and hot glue it in the end of a funnel which will act like a hopper. Get a large funnel and cut the tip so that it is level, then cut a notch in both sides so that the plastic valve will sit in it. Cut the inlet pipe of the valve shorter but not all the way flush with the body of the valve, then put hot glue all around the inlet pipe and set it in the notch cut in the funnel. Put more hot glue around the outside to seal it. you now need to cut a piece of 1\" PVC pipe to around 5 feet. now wrap a piece of the pillow cases you have over the end of the 1\" PVC Pipe you have and secure it so it wont come off, use a large hose clamp or something. Before you put in your charcoal you want to remove as much dust as you can, wear latex gloves and a mask for this, using a sieve sieve out all the dust and put the sieved charcoal to one side for use in the filter. Now fill the tube with the charcoal pieces, but leave enough room to put the funnel in without touching the charcoal inside, about 6 inches was enough, but you may want to measure your funnel with the valve in it before you fill up the tube. It helps to use a cone made of paper to do this. I made a holder for the filter using some scraps of wood, I drilled a 32mm hole in to pieces of wood and attached them with a 3rd piece to make an I shape, then i just slide the tube through and popped on a hose clamp, clamped it to the table, set it to the right height and done the hose clamp up to hold it in place, because the clamp is larger than the hole it holds it in place nicely. run water through the new filter until the water runs clear, now put the end of the tube in a bucket and put some cling film over the top or a plastic bag with an elastic band and stash it out the way until we need it later on. I actually tested it out by putting tap water in the filter and drinking it, which was surprising, it was crisp and clean, and the tap water here is horrible and full of chlorine but the filter stripped that out.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F1H/Z728/HQJZSNOO/F1HZ728HQJZSNOO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ8/F9HE/HQK98TUD/FQ8F9HEHQK98TUD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLM/RY1N/HQJZSNOP/FLMRY1NHQJZSNOP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5V/SROC/HQJZPIAA/F5VSROCHQJZPIAA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F29/7WWC/HQJZPIB7/F297WWCHQJZPIB7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F51/SK2T/HQKYAYPG/F51SK2THQKYAYPG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA3/ANOM/HQKYABJO/FA3ANOMHQKYABJO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FK0/JLPM/HQKYABLB/FK0JLPMHQKYABLB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3M/4UYR/HQLO4V1O/F3M4UYRHQLO4V1O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO4/JUX2/HQLO4V1Q/FO4JUX2HQLO4V1Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBF/TA2W/HQLO4V1R/FBFTA2WHQLO4V1R.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ2/JK1V/HQKYAYPP/FJ2JK1VHQKYAYPP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC2/6BT4/HQKYABN2/FC26BT4HQKYABN2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2S/8FY3/HQKYABN4/F2S8FY3HQKYABN4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQZ/F8I4/HQKYAYQ1/FQZF8I4HQKYAYQ1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6J/L2XY/HQKYABN9/F6JL2XYHQKYABN9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHK/MDX1/HQKYAYQ4/FHKMDX1HQKYAYQ4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCH/9ML4/HQKYABNC/FCH9ML4HQKYABNC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNZ/2G9M/HQKYABNE/FNZ2G9MHQKYABNE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNE/31KC/HQKYAYR5/FNE31KCHQKYAYR5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSH/SYO9/HQLO4V1Z/FSHSYO9HQLO4V1Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDY/JQ10/HQKYAYRI/FDYJQ10HQKYAYRI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLL/WCG6/HQKYAYRO/FLLWCG6HQKYAYRO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCI/B7XO/HQKYABNM/FCIB7XOHQKYABNM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIS/3BJS/HQLO4V20/FIS3BJSHQLO4V20.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F58/GAM0/HQNC4KOV/F58GAM0HQNC4KOV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX4/1981/HQO4G06R/FX41981HQO4G06R.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLY/UKG4/HQNC4KOY/FLYUKG4HQNC4KOY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7A/A5S7/HQNC4KOZ/F7AA5S7HQNC4KOZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4V/VJK4/HQO4G06X/F4VVJK4HQO4G06X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC8/1BLJ/HQMN67KR/FC81BLJHQMN67KR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5L/964E/HQMN67KT/F5L964EHQMN67KT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE1/QIVN/HQMN67M4/FE1QIVNHQMN67M4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKQ/1VHF/HQNC4KPK/FKQ1VHFHQNC4KPK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9C/0FSP/HQO4G092/F9C0FSPHQO4G092.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8W/5VTI/HQNC4KPN/F8W5VTIHQNC4KPN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC5/6RCM/HQNC4KPQ/FC56RCMHQNC4KPQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1N/GMCZ/HQMN67PL/F1NGMCZHQMN67PL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXE/6X0N/HQO4G09F/FXE6X0NHQO4G09F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F96/G69A/HQNC4KQZ/F96G69AHQNC4KQZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3J/155G/HQO4G0EM/F3J155GHQO4G0EM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3H/1S02/HQNC4KR0/F3H1S02HQNC4KR0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP0/JUL8/HQNC4KR4/FP0JUL8HQNC4KR4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX4/CYPM/HQNC4KR7/FX4CYPMHQNC4KR7.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Making the Filter With the Charcoal"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "You need to have your boiler lower than your fermenter so you can siphon the fermenter in to the boiler for your still. but before we get to siphoning we need to clean everything make sure its all clean and sterilized I have not worked this hard to get here only to have an infection ruin it so I am sterilizing everything. 2 Jugs for collecting the spirit from the still, the hydrometer which is one for spirit so i know what percentage I am getting out.a container for the spirit which I can then put the hydrometer the demi john which I will be putting the spirit in after it has distilled. a funnel for the demi john even the cork for the demi john also I ran the solution through the siphon, I am taking no risks here.

Its called the thumper because moonshiners would have a keg for this called a thump keg and it would make a THUMP THUMP THUMP sound when bubbles come out from the still. if you dont have a thumper on your still don't worry, you don't really need it you can double distill it, for this you would need to do a fer runs to build up what is known as low wines, so you distill it to say 30 - 40 % and then put it all back in the still and distill it again to about 70% which is what i am aiming for in one go using the thumper. Interesting side note here on thumpers there is also a similar device which is called a slobber knocker, this is basically the same but the inlet tube does not go very far in and there is no liquid put in the keg. the purpose of this is to catch any gunk from the still should it happen, which is known as burping, this happens if your wash or beer foams up and comes up the still column. by having the slobber knocker you would not end up getting this in your finished product but it would not act as a second distillation. ok well next on goes the condenser, mine is a liebig which is a tube with a jacket around it and in that jacket cold water runs I chose this because it would be easier to store. Some people have a bucket or a keg with a coiled copper pipe in it called a worm and water would flow in to the top of the keg and out of the bottom cooling the worm. hook up the hoses, I already had mine hooked up as I just finished running a load of cleaning solutions through it as its been sitting around for a few months. Run some water through it so the condenser is primed, no need to leave it running yet. Now we need to hook up the controller, I have printed a casing for my controller now using the 3D printer, if anyone wants the STL files for this give me a shout, and turn on the power to about half. We want to take this nice and slow so we don't burn it and we keep some of the flavors in there. It will take some time to heat up and you get some warning of when its about to come out of the condenser because the bubbles in the thumper start to get very rapid, you will start to see a couple of drops come out of the condenser, at this point you need to turn the water on to the condenser. collect about 50ml and throw that away, it has all the nasty stuff in it like methanol and the esters which make hangovers much worse. Interestingly Jack Daniels and other Distillery's use a continuous still so they don't separate these out. we want to collect everything now at about 70% if possible doesn't matter if its a bit over as when its all mixed together it will level out, we want to keep collecting the spirit until the alcohol volume starts to drop off, when it gets to about 60% keep the spirit separate from the main batch. we can then add this to the main spirit to level out the percentage if need be and use it to alter the flavor. I am writing this as I am running the still and the first lot out was 40% which is too low it needs to be higher so that it will get the flavors from the oak chips later. the only thing to do is reduce the power to the still and run it slower this will hopefully up the percentage. Ok so I have tried slowing it down which hasn't worked either, so I think my thumper is not doing its job basically and the mash doesn't have enough alcohol in it unlike when I do my sugar runs. But this is ok, i can just collect it at what I am getting and use it as low wines, when I have collected enough from a couple of distills I will run it through again which will give me my higher percentage. ;-) and it will be a true sour mash. the only other way to do it is to cheat which I wanted to avoid doing but if you wanted to you could, by adding sugar to the mash basically. when the spirit coming off gets to around 25 - 30% shut the boiler off and unplug it and let it cool down. once the boiler has cooled down, normally we would throw away the stuff in the boiler which is the backset, but this is sour mash so we need to keep some of it, so we collect this for the next batch, we need at least 25% of a full mash to make it proper sour mash.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FR3/IEQB/HQMN5VVI/FR3IEQBHQMN5VVI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6G/BVIX/HQNC4CTQ/F6GBVIXHQNC4CTQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD5/CS52/HQNC4CTT/FD5CS52HQNC4CTT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKP/EKHO/HQMN5VVN/FKPEKHOHQMN5VVN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5A/2KYO/HQNC4CU5/F5A2KYOHQNC4CU5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F99/DSKC/HQNA4933/F99DSKCHQNA4933.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV1/ZDWI/HQNC4CU8/FV1ZDWIHQNC4CU8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR3/Z8K8/HQMN5VVQ/FR3Z8K8HQMN5VVQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH1/OG6G/HQNA4938/FH1OG6GHQNA4938.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSD/GRFO/HQMN5VWH/FSDGRFOHQMN5VWH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFS/6G4H/HQNC4CUJ/FFS6G4HHQNC4CUJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1T/61ZU/HQNA493D/F1T61ZUHQNA493D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F70/AA87/HQMN5VWL/F70AA87HQMN5VWL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNW/VN0O/HQMN5VWM/FNWVN0OHQMN5VWM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6H/8VOH/HQMN5VWO/F6H8VOHHQMN5VWO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHR/Y74T/HQNA493H/FHRY74THQNA493H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVA/TSXP/HQNC4CV8/FVATSXPHQNC4CV8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFV/XW9D/HGU2JYGT/FFVXW9DHGU2JYGT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2S/JI5G/HQO4FZI2/F2SJI5GHQO4FZI2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6T/J56D/HQMN63GL/F6TJ56DHQMN63GL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FER/D30O/HQO4FZI7/FERD30OHQO4FZI7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F74/ANLQ/HQNC4HQ3/F74ANLQHQNC4HQ3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFC/LQA6/HQNC4HSB/FFCLQA6HQNC4HSB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP5/PYCK/HQO4FZIC/FP5PYCKHQO4FZIC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ3/LPM8/HQMN63IW/FZ3LPM8HQMN63IW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSY/IIKA/HQNC4HWL/FSYIIKAHQNC4HWL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCF/TJFJ/HQNC4HWW/FCFTJFJHQNC4HWW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4J/SLMK/HQNC4HXG/F4JSLMKHQNC4HXG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1C/65V9/HQMN63JT/F1C65V9HQMN63JT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPG/0E04/HQO4FZIS/FPG0E04HQO4FZIS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIB/94JZ/HQO4FZIX/FIB94JZHQO4FZIX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU6/D6RM/HQNC4HZY/FU6D6RMHQNC4HZY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEH/7KED/HQNC4I1H/FEH7KEDHQNC4I1H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBT/HN07/HQO4FZJ3/FBTHN07HQO4FZJ3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FET/MW58/HQNC4I4Y/FETMW58HQNC4I4Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYZ/S7PU/HQNC4I70/FYZS7PUHQNC4I70.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM3/1ZN5/HQO4FZJJ/FM31ZN5HQO4FZJJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7J/DTLP/HQO4FZJQ/F7JDTLPHQO4FZJQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5X/M9T0/HQNC4IB2/F5XM9T0HQNC4IB2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDQ/AGQB/HQO4FZKB/FDQAGQBHQO4FZKB.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Charging the Boiler and Distilling"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "\n          only do this step if you are making Tennessee whiskey, its not used in Kentucky Bourbon Now you need to filter the whiskey through the charcoal filter, take the modified funnel and put a little water in it and adjust the flow so it has a regular drip quiet fast but you want drips not a stream, dump the water out and put the funnel in the top of the filter.

I used Jack Daniels smoking chips you can just use white oak but you will need to toast and char them your self, you can do this by wrapping the chips in foil and putting it in a preheated oven at 200 degree C for about 1 hour. then you need to lightly char them using a blow torch don't worry if they catch alight just blow them out, use a water spray to dowse the burning and stop it charring too much. I used to do this when making rum. the toasting brings out the vanillians in the wood and the charging caramelizes the sugars and helps to add color to the spirit. if you are using JD smoking chips you need to try and put a fair number of charred chips in as well as the uncharred, there is not always enough charred chips so you can char them in the same way as you would normal oak, do not char them too heavy. every few day or so shake it so that you have different spirit in contact with the wood. Bourbon and Tennessee Whiskey get 50% of their flavor from the oak aging process, in the warehouses that they store the barrels in the temprature changes with the seasons we can emulate this by moving the bottle from a warm place to a cold place every few days. This will pull the spirit in and out of the wood as the wood and spirit expands and detracts this will pull the flavors out of the wood. I just put my bottle in a warm room for a day or too then move it to my hall way which is very cold for a few days. normally it takes about 4 years to age in a barrel but with this process we can speed things up because of the increase in surface area and by moving it in and out of the a warm area. we should be able to reduce this down to 1 or 2 months, you will need to keep and eye on the color and taste it now and then to make sure the flavor is right.

I got the stamp on ebay a few years back but it has a nice pattern to it and a capital N for N1cod3mus my online name and now my Whiskey brand. Also by sealing the top it reduces the risk of the cork coming out in transit and it looks freaking awesome! just put a bowl on the top of a saucepan full of water, just make sure its a bowl you can heat. chop up the wax in to smaller pieces and put a few bits in and wait for them to melt then add more. I had 1kg of wax. don't be tempted to use candles as the wax on them is brittle and with break up, i choose cheese wax because its pliable and wouldn't snap off. add small amounts of wax at a time, adding cold wax to hot wax will cause something called freezing which is when it all becomes one big lump. by adding it gradually it doesn't freeze and we can keep adding bit by bit until we have a bowl full of liquid with no lumps. I had to dip the bottle a few times, so dip wait a few seconds for that layer to set a little then dip again and keep dipping to build up the layers until its thick enough. hold the bottle over the bowl for a few seconds after the last dip then put it on the side and quickly put the stamp on the top, you don't need to push down the wax is soft enough. leave it in place until the wax cools and then remove. when you are done pour the remaining wax in to a cake tin or dish lined with grease proof paper until it sets so you end up with a slab and not a big lump you can't get out of the bowl. and thats it, I have my finished bottle, which will be great as a present to someone, you could even put their name and age on it for a birthday.

It is a member of the halogen group on the periodic table and is a highly reactive nonmetallic element and oxidizing agent that readily forms compounds (notably oxides) with most elements.Photosynthesis releases oxygen, and respiration consumes oxygen. Changes in phosphate are related to changes in oxygen concentrations.Oxygen was discovered independently by Carl Wilhelm Schele, in Upsala, in 1773 or earlier, and Joseph Priestley in Wiltshire, in 1774, but Priestley is often given priority because his work was published first. The name oxygen was coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier,whose experiments with oxygen helped to discredit the then-popular phlogiston theory of combustion and corrosion. Its name derives from the Greek roots oxys, \"acid\", literally \"sharp\", referring to the sour taste of acids and -\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03ae\u03c2 -genes, \"producer\", literally \"begetter\", because at the time of naming, it was mistakenly thought that all acids required oxygen in their composition.Two major methods are employed to produce 100 million tonnes of O2 extracted from air for industrial uses annually.The most common method is to fractionally distill liquefied air into its various components, with N 2 distilling as a vapor while O 2 is left as a liquid.The other major method of producing O 2 gas involves passing a stream of clean, dry air through one bed of a pair of identical zeolite molecular sieves, which absorbs the nitrogen and delivers a gas stream that is 90% to 93% O 2.Simultaneously, nitrogen gas is released from the other nitrogen-saturated zeolite bed, by reducing the chamber operating pressure and diverting part of the oxygen gas from the producer bed through it, in the reverse direction of flow. After a set cycle time the operation of the two beds is interchanged, thereby allowing for a continuous supply of gaseous oxygen to be pumped through a pipeline. This is known as pressure swing adsorption. Oxygen gas is increasingly obtained by these non-cryogenic technologies (see also the related vacuum swing adsorption).Oxygen gas can also be produced through electrolysis of water into molecular oxygen and hydrogen. DC electricity must be used: if AC is used, the gases in each limb consist of hydrogen and oxygen in the explosive ratio 2:1. Contrary to popular belief, the 2:1 ratio observed in the DC electrolysis of acidified water does not prove that the empirical formula of water is H2O unless certain assumptions are made about the molecular formulae of hydrogen and oxygen themselves. A similar method is the electrocatalytic O 2 evolution from oxides andoxoacids. Chemical catalysts can be used as well, such as in chemical oxygen generators or oxygen candles that are used as part of the life-support equipment on submarines, and are still part of standard equipment on commercial airliners in case of depressurization emergencies. Another air separation technology involves forcing air to dissolve through ceramic membranes based on zirconium dioxideby either high pressure or an electric current, to produce nearly pure O 2 gas.In large quantities, the price of liquid oxygen in 2001 was approximately $0.21/kg.Since the primary cost of production is the energy cost of liquefying the air, the production cost will change as energy cost varies.                                                                               HydrogenHydrogen is a chemical element with chemical symbol H and atomic number 1. With an atomic weight of 1.00794 u, hydrogen is the lightest element on the periodic table. Its monatomic form (H) is the most abundant chemical substance in the universe, constituting roughly 75% of all baryonic mass.Non-remnant stars are mainly composed of hydrogen in its plasma state. The most common isotope of hydrogen, termed protium (name rarely used, symbol 1H), has one proton and no neutrons.The universal emergence of atomic hydrogen first occurred during the recombination epoch. At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, nonmetallic, highly combustible diatomic gas with the molecular formula H2. Since hydrogen readily forms covalent compounds with most non-metallic elements, most of the hydrogen on Earth exists in molecular forms such as in the form of water or organic compounds. Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid\u2013base reactions as many acid-base reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of a negative charge when it is known as a hydride, or as a positively charged species denoted by the symbol H+. The hydrogen cation is written as though composed of a bare proton, but in reality, hydrogen cations in ionic compounds are always more complex species than that would suggest. As the only neutral atom for which the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be solved analytically,study of the energetics and bonding of the hydrogen atom has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics. Hydrogen gas was first artificially produced in the early 16th century, via the mixing of metals with acids. In 1766\u201381, Henry Cavendish was the first to recognize that hydrogen gas was a discrete substance,and that it produces water when burned, a property which later gave it its name: in Greek, hydrogen means \"water-former\". Industrial production is mainly from the steam reforming of natural gas, and less often from more energy-intensive hydrogen production methods like the electrolysis of water.Most hydrogen is employed near its production site, with the two largest uses being fossil fuel processing and ammonia production, mostly for the fertilizer market. Hydrogen is a concern in metallurgy as it can embrittle many metals,complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanksIn the laboratory, H2 is usually prepared by the reaction of dilute non-oxidizing acids on some reactive metals such as zinc with Kipp's apparatus. Zn + 2 H+  \u2192 Zn2+  + H 2Aluminium can also produce H 2 upon treatment with bases: 2 Al + 6 H 2O + 2 OH\u2212  \u2192 2 Al(OH)\u2212 4 + 3 H 2The electrolysis of water is a simple method of producing hydrogen. A low voltage current is run through the water, and gaseous oxygen forms at the anode while gaseous hydrogen forms at the cathode. Typically the cathode is made from platinum or another inert metal when producing hydrogen for storage. If, however, the gas is to be burnt on site, oxygen is desirable to assist the combustion, and so both electrodes would be made from inert metals. (Iron, for instance, would oxidize, and thus decrease the amount of oxygen given off.) The theoretical maximum efficiency (electricity used vs. energetic value of hydrogen produced) is in the range 80\u201394%.2 H 2O(l) \u2192 2 H 2(g) + O 2(g)In 2007, it was discovered that an alloy of aluminium and gallium in pellet form added to water could be used to generate hydrogen. The process also creates alumina, but the expensive gallium, which prevents the formation of an oxide skin on the pellets, can be re-used. This has important potential implications for a hydrogen economy, as hydrogen can be produced on-site and does not need to be transported.                                                                               ChlorineChlorine is a chemical element with symbol Cl and atomic number 17. Chlorine is in the halogen group and is the second lightest halogen following fluorine. The element is a yellow-green gas under standard conditions, where it forms diatomic molecules. Chlorine has the highest electron affinity and the third highest electronegativity of all the reactive elements. For this reason, chlorine is a strong oxidizing agent. Free chlorine is rare on Earth, and is usually a result of direct or indirect oxidation byoxygen.The most common compound of chlorine, sodium chloride (common salt), has been known since ancient times. Around 1630, chlorine gas was first synthesized in a chemical reaction, but not recognized as a fundamentally important substance. Characterization of chlorine gas was made in 1774 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, who supposed it to be an oxide of a new element. In 1809, chemists suggested that the gas might be a pure element, and this was confirmed by Sir Humphry Davy in 1810, who named it from Ancient Greek\"pale green\". Nearly all chlorine in the Earth's crust occurs as chloride in various ionic compounds, including table salt. It is the second most abundant halogen and 21st most abundant chemical element in Earth's crust. Elemental chlorine is commercially produced frombrine by electrolysis. The high oxidizing potential of elemental chlorine led commercially to free chlorine's bleaching and disinfectant uses, as well as its many uses of an essential reagent in the chemical industry. Chlorine is used in the manufacture of a wide range of consumer products, about two-thirds of them organic chemicals such as polyvinyl chloride, as well as many intermediates for production of plastics and other end products which do not contain the element. As a common disinfectant, elemental chlorine and chlorine-generating compounds are used more directly in swimming pools to keep them clean and sanitary. In the form of chloride ions, chlorine is necessary to all known species of life. Other types of chlorine compounds are rare in living organisms, and artificially produced chlorinated organics range from inert to toxic. In the upper atmosphere, chlorine-containing organic molecules such as chlorofluorocarbons have been implicated in ozone depletion. Small quantities of elemental chlorine are generated by oxidation of chloride to hypochlorite in neutrophils, as part of the immune response against bacteria. Elemental chlorine at high concentrations is extremely dangerous and poisonous for all living organisms, and was used in World War I as the first gaseous chemical warfare agent.In industry, elemental chlorine is usually produced by the electrolysis of sodium chloride dissolved in water. This method, the chloralkali process industrialized in 1892, now provides essentially all industrial chlorine gas.Along with chlorine, the method yields hydrogen gas and sodium hydroxide (with sodium hydroxide actually being the most crucial of the three industrial products produced by the process). The process proceeds according to the following chemical equation:2 NaCl + 2 H2O \u2192 Cl2 + H2 + 2 NaOHThe electrolysis of chloride solutions all proceed according to the following equations: Cathode: 2 H+(aq) + 2 e\u2212 \u2192 H2(g)Anode: 2 Cl\u2212(aq) \u2192 Cl2(g) + 2 e\u2212Overall process: 2 NaCl (or KCl) + 2 H2O \u2192 Cl2 + H2 + 2 NaOH (or KOH) In diaphragm cell electrolysis, an asbestos (or polymer-fiber) diaphragm separates a cathode and an anode, preventing the chlorine forming at the anode from re-mixing with the sodium hydroxide and the hydrogen formed at the cathode.The salt solution (brine) is continuously fed to the anode compartment and flows through the diaphragm to the cathode compartment, where the caustic alkali is produced and the brine is partially depleted. Diaphragm methods produce dilute and slightly impure alkali but they are not burdened with the problem of preventing mercury discharge into the environment and they are more energy efficient. Membrane cell electrolysis employ permeable membrane as an ion exchanger. Saturated sodium (or potassium) chloride solution is passed through the anode compartment, leaving at a lower concentration.This method is more efficient than the diaphragm cell and produces very pure sodium (or potassium) hydroxide at about 32% concentration, but requires very pure brine.", "title": "Make Hydrogen,Oxygen and Chlorine", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Make-HydrogenOxygen-And-Chlorine/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Hydrogen can be made in several waysZinc + Hydrochloric Acid \u2192 Zinc Chloride + Hydrogen(s) + 2HCl (l) \u2192 ZnCl2 (l)+ H2 (g)Aluminium + Sodium Hydroxide \u2192 Hydrogen + Sodium AluminateOr by electrolysing water,baking soda solution or salt.Cheapest,Easiest and the Safest methods are method 2 and 3Lets do method 2Chemicals and things to do thisA plastic beaker,use plastic only do not use glass or NaOH will eat it.Aluminium sheets or foil(sheets are good)NaOH wich is also known as washing sodaWaterA matchA clean work place.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FHF/2BP0/IDRP8WA4/FHF2BP0IDRP8WA4.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: How to Make Hydrogen"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Put water and washing soda togetherThen put some aluminium stripsnow let it react and slowly make a long match shown as the picture", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ0/N3UL/IDRP8X31/FQ0N3ULIDRP8X31.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Put All Together"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Fire the match and slowly move it to the gasNow you can hear the sound of hydrogen........POP!!!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWS/OJ3Y/IDRP8X6V/FWSOJ3YIDRP8X6V.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2V/12TS/IDRP8X6W/F2V12TSIDRP8X6W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE0/PSV1/IDRP8X70/FE0PSV1IDRP8X70.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Burn It!!"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "                                                                         Danger Chlorine is Poisonous!!!Ways to make chlorineHCl + O2 \u2192 2 Cl2 + 2 H2ONaCl + H2SO4 + MnO2 \u2192 Na2SO4 + MnSO4 + 2 H2O + Cl2KMNO4 + HCl = KCl + MNCl2 + H2O + Cl2We will try the third method which is easy and cheapChemicals and Equipment RequiredA beakerPotassium permanganate (KMnO4)HCl (Hydrochloric Acid)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FU8/TNMJ/IDRP8XCK/FU8TNMJIDRP8XCK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: How to Make Chlorine"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Here you can see a bubble of chlorine!!!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FYW/D2OB/IDRP8YNH/FYWD2OBIDRP8YNH.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: React It!"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Just mix hydrogen peroxide with potassium permanganateOr mix sulfuric acid with potassium permanganate or manganese oxide which is found inside batteries                                                                                                                                          Thanks for reading                                                                                                                                        sorry for bad quality                                                                                                                                  p;ease request for more and comment!!!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FD3/6VN5/IDRP8YRA/FD36VN5IDRP8YRA.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: How to Make Oxygen"}], "channel": "Science"}, {"category": "technology", "description": "I was looking around Instructables and saw many chemistry related Instructables, so I thought one on stoichiometry would help.

We have to balance the molecules to have the same number of atoms.\n6 H2O- Since we have 12 hydrogen atoms and each molecule has 2 atoms we 6 molecules of water.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n6 CO2- Since we have 6 carbon atoms and each molecule has one atom in it we need 6\nmolecules of CO2\nSo now the equation looks like that and we are almost done:\nC6H12O6 + O2 --> H2O + CO2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 x\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (6)\nNow that we know the number of molecules on the right we know the number of oxygen atoms in the equation. We have six H2O molecules each with one oxygen atom, so we have 6 oxygen atoms in those molecules. We also have six CO2 molecules each with two oxygen atoms in it, so we have 12 oxygen atoms in those molecules. So we have a total of 18 oxygen atoms on the left side.\n6 H2O= 6 oxygen atoms\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n6 CO2= 12 oxygen atoms\n6+12=18 atoms\nIf we know the number on the right side we know the number on the left side. Since we have one molecule of sugar that needs six atoms of oxygen; we subtract six from 18.\n18-6=12\nWe have an unknown amount of oxygen molecules each with 2 oxygen atoms each and we have 12 oxygen atoms left. To finish just divide the number of oxygen atoms left by the number you need in each molecule.\n12/2=6 oxygen molecules\nThat is the last number we need and the equation is balanced\nC6H12O6 + O2 --> H2O + CO2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (6)\nThat one was really easy but sometimes you will get an equation that doesn't work out so well. Sometimes one of the number wont come out as a whole number and that just wont work, because you can't have half of a molecule. Don't despair though all your hard work wasn't in vain just multiple by whatever makes that number a whole number\nExample:\nC3H7NO2 + O2 --> CO2 + H2O + NO2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\n3\u00a0 carbon, 7 hydrogen, 1 nitrogen dioxide, x oxygen\nC3H7NO2 + O2 --> CO2 + H2O + NO2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 x\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3.5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\n3 CO2- 6 oxygen atoms \u00a0 3.5 H2O- 3.5 oxygen atoms\n6+3.5=9.5 oxygen atoms\n9.5/2=4.75 oxygen molecules\nC3H7NO2 + O2 --> CO2 + H2O + NO2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (4.75)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3.5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\nAs you can see not all the numbers came out as whole numbers, but it can easily be fixed by multiplying it by the least common multiple.

In simple words it states as pressure increases so does temperature. the equation is P/T=k.\nP- pressure\nT- temperature\nk- constant\nYou can combine all three of those laws to get the combine gas law. Its equation is PV/T=k. To use this with stoichiometry you need to combine it with one last law, which is Avogadro's law. It states that at constant temperature and pressure equal volumes of gas contain the same number of moles. The equation is V/n=k\nV- volume\nn- moles\nk- constant\nWhen all four of these laws are combined together they make the ideal gas law. The equation for that (this is the important part since we will be using it for stoichiometry) is PV=nRT.\nR is the constant. The number changes depending on what units you measure it in. The basic outline of the units is PV/nT. I will be using the units kPa*L/n*K.\nkPa- kilo Pascals\nL- liters\nn- moles\nK- Kelvin\nThe n*K part will never change since the temperature must be measured in Kelvin and there are no other units for moles. The constant I am using is 8.314 L*kPa/n*K. To make it easier to solve stoichiometry problems arrange the equation\nso it looks like this PV/8.314*K.\nNow on to the actually stoichiometry. Nothing is really different just a different equation.\nHere is an example using the reaction between oxygen and iron to produce ferric oxide.\nYou have 5L. of oxygen in a lab that is 300 Kelvin and 22kPa.

When doing doing stoichiometry with solutions you need to know the concentration of reactants in your solvent. Specifically you need to know the moles per unit of solvent. There are many different ways of doing this, but I'm going to use molarity. Molarity is simply moles per liter.\u00a0\nTo find molarity of a solution we use n/L=M (M stands for molarity). To use it for stoichiometry arrange it so it looks like M*L=n.\nI'm going to describe how to make a 50mL. .75 molarity solution of NaCl in water. First start by doing the math.\n.75*.05 = .0375 moles\nSo I need .0375 moles of salt. Do the math to find what that is in grams.\n.0375*28 = 1.05g of salt\nNext is to make the actual solution. Start by filling a graduated cylinder with around 40mL of water. Now add the salt and let it completely dissolve. Finally add water up to 50mL.\nAlways when making a solution using molarity use less solvent then what you want the final solution to be dissolve the solute and then add the solvent to the final amount. This is because the solute takes up space too; if you add the solute to the measured amount of solvent it would come out as taking up more volume then you want, and you will have the wrong molarity.\nUsing solutions is great for chemical reactions, since it speeds them up. This is because the solvent breaks apart the ionic bonds of reactants. Besides that is also allows more atoms to get close enough to react. Since the solvent breaks apart the ionic compounds the chemical equation must be wrote different to reflect this.\nExample:\nAgNO3 + NaCl -->\u00a0 NaNO3 + AgCl\nWhen dissolved in a solvent it would look like this:\nAg+(aq) + NO3- (aq) + Na+ (aq) + Cl-(aq) --> AgCl (s) + NO3- (aq) + Na+ (aq)\nSince the NO3- + Na+ don't participate in the reaction they can be removed.\u00a0 The equation would look like this.\nAg+(aq) + Cl-(aq) --> AgCl(s)\nThe letters in parenthesis represent the state the substance is in\n(s)- solid\n(l)- liquid\n(g)- gas\n(aq)- aqueous or in solution\nHere is an example of solution stoichiometry using the reaction above.\nYou have 4L of 10 molarity solution of AgNO3.

The free metal does not occur in nature, but instead must be prepared from its compounds; it was first isolated by Humphry Davy in 1807 by the electrolysis of sodium hydroxide. Given its extraordinary chemical reactivity, there are multiple applications for this substance.

Not that hard to do, as NaOH melts at 318 \u00b0C . The temperature is reasonably low to allow the separation of the resulting sodium without spontaneous ignition in air, but extra caution must be exercised as the chemicals involved are highly caustic, especially at high temperatures.

MS is applied to fields as disparate as airport security, food and wine analysis, drug and explosives analysis, as well as most fields of chemical and biological research.  MS works by ionizing, or bestowing a net charge, on a sample of molecules and then sorting the ions based on their mass-to-charge ratio.  Since the particle has a one electron negative charge or one proton positive charge, the mass spectrometer can make use of electrical and/or magnetic fields to essentially sort molecules by their masses.  The charged molecules are then guided by electromagnetic attraction or repulsion to a detector mechanism.  A typical mass spectrum (shown below) plots the different mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) against their abundances (occurrence of a certain ion divided by the occurrence of the most plentiful ion) within the sample.Aspiring chemists and biologists, as well as anyone interested in gaining a greater understanding of these fields, can benefit from a greater understanding of MS.

Push the side of the file against the aluminium rod and move it up and down slowly. Take your time and don\u2019t go too deep or wide. The groove should only be as wide as the O ring. 4. Stop and check regularly. Once you have an even groove, remove the rod from the drill and add the O ring to the groove. If the O ring sits even in the groove, then you are ready to see if it fits into the tube. HERE\u2019S THE IMPORTANT BIT. Make sure you add a little bit of oil to the O ring. This will ensure that it moves easily and smoothly inside the tube. I didn\u2019t do this initially and my O ring kept on getting stuck inside. 5. To test you need to push the rod into the tube. You should feel a \u201ccushion\u201d of compressed air as you push the rod down. This will force the rod to bounce back up again.

This is NOT an instructable for kids! This is for educational purposes and if you attempt this you are doing so at your own risk. I am not responsible if you get hurt attempting this. The responsibility for your safety depends on you! I try to discuss how to do this safely throughout the instructable so, READ EVERYTHING CAREFULLY, but realize I can't think of every safety problem. HAVE A FIRE EXTINGUISHER HANDY! If you do not have a high level of understanding of the chemistry and physics involved you really should not do this. That said, science and learning without danger would yield no cars, no fireworks, and no disease cures. So, I'm going to donate my body to some dangerous science! Maybe some of you experienced a common flame test lab in high school. The one where you try to identify the presence of different metals by dipping little sticks in alcohol mixed with salts and observing what color the solution burns. This is basically like that on super soldier serum. This little baby can shoot up to 5 feet of flame and shoot two colors at once (three colors are possible if blending the fire streams). This thing can produce impressive flames for up to twenty seconds. To me, that's pretty sweet for a pocket-sized flamethrower holding maybe 20 grams of fuel.BUT CAN'T THE FLAME GET SUCKED INTO THE CANISTER AND BLOW UP?! No. In this case the fuel canister is made safe with self pressurizing butane fuel. In order to have fire you need fuel and an oxidizing agent such as O2 (makes up ~20% of air) or N2O(nitrous oxide) or one of many other oxidizing agents (oxygen may not even be involved). Since the canister is full of fuel with no oxidizer, it is not going to explode. If this were not the case, bic and other butane lighters would all be potential grenades in your hands. Their fuel sprays directly from where it is stored, into the flame. Some may say, but I've seen videos of lighters turned into little explosives. True and this could blast fire everywhere too if the plastic canisters melt and release the fuel. The container can explode if there is a second hole in the container, as this could cause air to get sucked up into it. You still have to be careful here. To achieve colored fires another fuel, 100% denatured alcohol, is added to various fire coloring ionic compounds and mixed in with the butane. Some of these ionic compounds are toxic (very small amounts are used though), as is denatured alcohol. Yet another reason to be cautious. Why do the chemicals used produce color? As the metals in the ionic compounds get hot, their electrons get bumped up to a more excited orbital state. It is an electron's nature to not want to stay in this excited state. So, to go back to the way it was, it rids itself of energy in the form of light. Due to different metals having electrons in different orbital states, the different metal's electrons emit different colors of light when excited. Since the alcohol and butane don't really emit much visible light, when burned efficiently, (like with the high pressure nozzle used here that mixes in a lot of oxygen with the fuel ) you see the colors emitted by the metals clearly. How does it fire? I just simply push the little clear plastic tabs down onto the butane tanks' valves and out comes the pressurized fuel over a flaming pilot light wick. Each tab activates one tank making multiple colored blasts possible. Make sure to read all the picture notes too. You can't be a convincing pyromancer/pyrokinetic without fire!

Don't use vinyl tubing for this. Vinyl tubing gets rigid and leaks at the nozzles when the super cold butane comes out of the canisters. Rapidly expanding gases cause cooling (the tubes will feel as cold as ice when operating this device). It's the same principal that makes a refrigerator work. Nitro line is made from silicone and is somewhat fire resistant and does not get rigid in the cold. Check and be absolutely sure that the nitro line you use stays on the butane tank nozzle. If the diameter of your hose is too big it will just get blown off or slip off. The stuff I used is said to be 2 mm internal diameter, but close observation with digital calipers puts it more at 2.3 mm. I tried this with some 2.6 mm internal diameter silicone hose and it did not stay on as well. I used a 50' spool of Du-BRO (2239). You can buy shorter 2 ft sections sold as Du-BRO 2231 and it also comes in lots of colors. The stuff I used was perfect; the silicone makes it grab and stay on the nozzle very well. Just make sure there is no fluid on the nozzle when you slip it on.\u00a0 Always be watchful so you don't spray yourself with flammable fluid. I have not yet had this happen to me, despite heavy use of this thing. The tubing for the firing nozzle (referring here to the part that actually shoots the flame) that I really liked is made of brass. The aluminum stuff its too bendy. One of the most important things to achieving good colored flames is having a high pressure tiny nozzle. If you spray too much liquid that is not aersolized well, it will just burn the same color as an ordinary flame. In order for the colors to show, the fuel must mix well with air to burn completely. Cut the hose and round brass tube to size as seen in the pics. Crush the end of the tube with needle-nose pliers to make a very small opening for fuel to shoot out.

Wear splash glasses when filling these tanks. I've had this stuff spray me while working with it and I was glad I was wearing them. You don't want this crap in your forehead balls. I only use about a gram or fraction of a gram of ionic compounds for about every 100 mL of denatured alcohol because it takes very little to get color and more may just clog up your nozzle. Plus, some of these ionic compounds are toxic, but rather small amounts are used. Don't use methanol alcohol (Heet). It works, but it's more toxic and allows whatever is mixed with it to diffuse through your skin. The methanol itself also goes right through your skin. It's a lot more toxic than ethanol (the alcohol in booze). There is some methanol (or a similar substance) in denatured alcohol (in some cases >10% methanol), hence why I wear the nitrile gloves when mixing this stuff. Denatured alcohol largely contains ethanol. They put something toxic like methanol and bitter substances in denatured alcohol to discourage people from drinking it (to keep sales costs down by avoiding liquor tax). Read all the included material and safety data sheets on the chemicals being used here so you know what is going on with them. My friend and I accidentally spilled a couple of ounces of methanol and boric acid on our arms while teaming up to make a large green flamethrower (which worked great). We promptly washed it off with water, but felt a weird tingling sensation on the surface of our arms for a few hours afterwards. I don't think it was good for us, but we survived. Just be careful with these chemicals and work only with small amounts. Methanol can actually cause blindness and according to the Nation Institutes of Health, \"As little as 2 tablespoons can be deadly to a child. About 2 to 8 ounces can be deadly for an adult.\" I can't say that I completely know what all the products are that are produced by burning all of this stuff together. A mix of butane, denatured alcohol (which can be a mix of several things), and ionic compounds burning in air comprises a lot of chemical reactions occurring at once. In a standard scaled down version of this that a teacher would conduct in a chem lab, a butane burner may be used to burn these ionic compounds mixed with methanol alcohol, but a very small amount is used. I'm burning a big cloud of this stuff. So, there is a certain unknown risk in all this to be aware of. Isopropyl rubbing alcohol will have crappy performance even at 99 percent purity. It doesn't burn clear enough for the colors to show through well. Copper chloride is not a good colorant to use here since it is rather corrosive to metal and may wreck the seals on the butane tanks. I use copper acetate instead. I also avoid lithium salts. They look cool (magenta), but they're not so great for you. Links for Material and Safety data sheets.

Attach the hose snugly to the top of the mini butane refill tank nozzle. The lever on the nozzle simply needs to be pushed down and the fluid can be injected in. The container must be emptied of butane or else it will be very hard to push the fluid in and it may just wind up spraying everywhere. You can fill the butane tanks with this liquid anywhere from very little to 3/4 full. I've found that adding more tends to make the fire last longer, but doesn't make it that much more colorful. The more alcohol you have the more likely it is for the flaming liquid to make it to the ground rather than burning up in the air. This is due to the fact that butane burns up more readily. This of course makes it more dangerous for you as it keeps burning whatever gets sprayed longer.\u00a0 I attached a small section of hose to the fill nozzle of the large butane refill canister that will be filling the little ones. The other end of the hose was attached to the nozzle of the little canister.

It starts with an oxidation level of -2/3, and finishes with +4. At first, it doesn't seem that four electrons are being received here and that is why this equation is hard to balance. Because there are 3 Carbon atoms in Glycerin molecule, we multiply -2/3 with 3 and get -2.

These stoves kill over a million people and especially young children annually from indoor air pollution. Improved cook stoves exist, but it is very expensive to monitor how much they reduce particulate emissions in the field. The objective of this project was to design a protocol and test low-cost particulate detectors based on tape, white paper, Dixie cups and citric acid. We wanted to simulate a cookstove, like ones in Uganda, so we loosely wrapped the steel drum with foil, so keep the smoke contained. A handful of careful tests may show if these low-cost methods hold promise.\nSMOKY FIRE PROTOCOL\nThe following are a list of rules and regulations that should always be followed when lighting a fire. Failure to do so may result in harmful consequences.\n1. Always start a fire in a container (the 55-gallon steel barrel or a barbeque pit)\n2. Always have at least three to four damp towels with you to prevent fire spreads\n3. Always have a fire extinguisher to control fire in case of unexpected fires\n4. Make sure the area around the fire area is not too dry and clear area of any flammable materials\n5. (optional) Wear face masks to prevent inhalation of smoke particulates\n6. Use barbeque tools to keep fingers and hands from the fire\nSTARTING A FIRE\n1. Spray the coals evenly all over with charcoal lighter fluid until they are saturated\n2. Close the lighter fluid container tightly, and set the container away from the grill\n3. Using a long match or long-handled butane lighter, light the fluid-saturated briquettes in several spots, watching to see that the flames leap to other charcoal until the entire stack is burning\nMATERIALS:\nDixie cups\nClear Tape\nPaper (preferably smooth)\nCitric acid (in the form of lemon juice)\nSteel drum\nFire starting materials (coal, lighter, fuel)\nFoil\nPROCEDURE:\n1) cut a square piece of paper\n2) wrap the paper around the dixie cup (as shown in Picture)\n3) secure with tape\n4) evenly distribute citric acid on paper\n5) tape along edge of steel drum upsidedown! (as shown in Picture)\n6) start fire\n7) wrap steel drum loosely with foil\n8) check paper for signs of particle and color change\nIdeally, the smoke would not escape as much due to the foil containing the smoke within the steel drum. Any particles and particulates from the smoke would be caught in the paper. The heat would show color change on the paper due to oxidation of the citric acid.", "title": "How to Make a Low Cost Smoke Detector", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-make-a-Low-Cost-Smoke-Detector/", "section": "outside", "steps": [], "channel": "Fire"}, {"category": "outside", "description": "On and off, I've been working on an all-metal (and hence non-shattering) version of the Jam Jar Jet.

Swift M, Lecorchick W, Ouattara O, Siderits I, Malik F.\nWe demonstrate how to make a reliable and useful scientific instrument called a \"Fraction collector\" for use with column chromatography applications or educational science projects. \nWe used the free downloadable \"Scratch\" graphical programming language and the Lego WeDo robotics kit to make this Auto Sampler/Fraction collector.\u00a0 The only cost is for the Lego WeDo robotics components and the Lego pieces used for the apparatus.\u00a0 We have taken the system through hundreds of cycles and it works reliably.\u00a0 In a nutshell, the scratch program gets input from a sensor and controls a servo motor.\u00a0 The motor turns a sample wheel that holds empty tubes until the sensor \"detects\" a tube in front of it.\u00a0 It then tells the program to stop the motor for a certain amount of time, then repeat the process for the next empty tube.\u00a0 Each tube stops under a sample outflow to collect a few drops then moves on to the next empty tube to collect the next sample.\u00a0 \nThe program that we wrote to control the Servo Motor and Sensor is also downloadable from the Scratch Website and you can easily change it for your own use.\nWe'll explain what a fraction collector does and how its used with column chromatography.To start with, If you wanted to sample the outflow from something over time or collect timed samples then you might want to use a fraction collector.\u00a0 It stops a sample bottle or vial for a given amount of time to collect some drips from an outflow tube and then moves the next empty sample container into position.\u00a0 Another variation on this theme would be to start with sample containers that had something in it, for example \"algae\" and stop in a magnetic field (between two magnets) for specific amounts of time or in front of an LED to give the sample different amount of light at a specific wavelength.\u00a0 You can stop the sample for a constant amount of time or program the sampler to stop at the magnets, fro example, for increasing or decreasing amounts of time for each sample.\u00a0 It would do this for 1-40 samples.\u00a0 This project can be easily reconfigured to include a proximity switch and light sensor with an LED circuit.\u00a0 You can even have multiple sites contributing sample to the containers as they stop and start at different positions.\nOK, back to the project, a Fraction collector can cost 4,000-15,000K$, ours cost less than 150$ and has a \"build time\" of less than 30 minutes (if you have the Lego and WeDo parts and you download our program script from the \"Scratch\" website).\u00a0\u00a0 \nOut apparatus can accept from 1-40 small sample vials or up to 10 larger sample bottles.\u00a0 The prototype is so easy to work with that you can do much more than we've described.\nHere are a few websites for reference as we go along.\nScratch graphical programming website:\u00a0 scratch.mit.edu

online \"Library for Science\"\n\"Fraction Collector  A fraction detector is a device that allows regular or specified samples  to be taken from a column eluate and stored in a retrievable form. The  storage vessels are usually small sample tubes or vials that are  oriented in a rotating disk or in a moving belt, there movement usually  being controlled by a microprocessor. On receiving a signal from the  microprocessor, the next vial is placed under the column outlet and the  eluate collected until receiving another signal from the computer. Once  the properties of the chromatogram that describes the separation has  been ascertained, then the collection program can be defined. The  fractions can be collected on a basis of time either at regular  intervals or a specific times to collect specific peaks. Alternatively  the fractions can be collected by monitoring the detector output and  when a peak starts to elute the fraction collector is activated and the  peak collected in a specific vial. When the peak returns to base line  the column eluate is then directed to waste until the next peak starts  eluting. Fraction collectors are in common use with most liquid  chromatographs. They are used to collect samples for further  purification, subsequent examination by spectroscopic techniques or for  biological or organoleptic testing.\"", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FBG/M85I/G8LWEP2T/FBGM85IG8LWEP2T.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 10: What Is a Fraction Collector?"}, {"step": 11, "steps_text": "Here are two excellent sites that talk about this technique:\nMicroflash DCC: orgchem.colorado.edu/hndbksupport/colchrom/colchromprocmicroflash.html\nColumn video: images.google.com/imgres", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FUD/F0VN/G8LWEP2K/FUDF0VNG8LWEP2K.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 11: What Is Dry Column Chromatography?"}, {"step": 12, "steps_text": "\n.O\n\t{font-size:149%;}\n<!--.sld\n\t{left:0px !important;\n\twidth:6.0in !important;\n\theight:4.0in !important;\n\tfont-size:103% !important;}\n-->\u00a0 Computer programming is often viewed as a tedious, specialized activity, accessible only to those with advanced technical training. Traditional programming languages like C++ and Java are difficult for most people to learn. The main goal of \u201cScratch\u201d, created at MIT,\u00a0 is to change that circumstance. Scratch uses the advancement of graphical interface design to make programming more engaging and easy to understand. Some key features of Scratch include: \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1. Building-block programming \u2013 To create a functioning program in Scratch, the user simply has to snap graphical blocks into stacks. In most programming languages the user would need to create a large amount of code, and this code might have numerous errors. With Scratch, this is not the case. The graphical blocks are designed to fit together only in ways that make syntactic sense, so there are no syntax errors. The best feature of Scratch is the ability to make changes to a program while it is running; it is easy to experiment with new ideas incrementally and iteratively.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2. Media manipulation \u2013 With most programming languages it is quite difficult to create programs that control and mix graphics, animations, music, and sound. With Scratch the user can collaborate graphics, animations, music, and sound very easily. \n\u00a0\u00a0 3. Sharing and collaboration \u2013 After creating a program with Scratch, it is easily accessible for other people. The creator can upload their program to the Scratch website, where anyone can view the program. This is excellent if one needs immediate feedback.\nWhat is a Pico Board? \nThe Pico Board was also developed by MIT. This is a small yellow board that has 4 resistors, a sound sensor, a light sensor, a button, and a slider. This board is connected to the computer through a USB cable, and the information that it reads can be accessed through Scratch.
