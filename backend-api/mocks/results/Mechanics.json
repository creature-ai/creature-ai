The passenger should indicate every 10 seconds after that and the driver should call out the current speed to the nearest whole km. The passenger should record this value next to each time. Aside: If you have a digital camera capable of recording several  minutes of low resolution video (as most people seem to have these  days), the process is much easier and more accurate. You don't need any  equipment except the digital camera. Simply have your passenger record a  video of your speedometer during the coast down tests, or find some way  of mounting the camera so you can do the recording without an  assistant.

However, in practice, if you want to compare performance before and after making modifications to your car, you can get faster results just by measuring the time to decelerate from speed A to speed B. Pick high to medium speeds if your modifications are likely to affect drag. Pick medium to low speeds if your modifications are likely to affect rolling resistance. Don't forget to take multiple measurements in each direction and average the results.\nFor more experiments you can do on your car see my website IWillTry.org.Update 2009-01-02:\nI've learned a lot since originally posting this instructable 16 months ago. I've played with measuring Cd and Crr under different conditions on a number of vehicles and other experimenters have picked apart and tweaked my spreadsheet for their own uses. \nMy experience is that there IS a mistake in one of the underlying assumptions of the model: namely that the force of rolling resistance is constant independent of V.  Vehicles are designed with negative lift (so they get pushed into the road more at higher speeds, improving handling) so the force of rolling resistance also has a component that varies with V2 like the drag force. The force of rolling resistance also includes a small component of viscous force (drivetrain) which varies with V. \nThe model assumes that the drag force is related only to V2 and that the force of rolling and drivetrain resistance is constant. In reality the force of rolling and drivetrain resistance is also related to V2 and V. So a better model of the force on a moving vehicle is:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 F = iV2 + jV + k where i, j, and k are constants.\nA curve based on that model more closely matches actual coast down data indicating it is a more accurate model. But after solving for i, j and k, there is no way to extract meaningful values of Cd and Crr since by definition, they assume i is related only to drag, and j is 0, neither of which is entirely true.\nAs mentioned above, If you want to compare performance of a vehicle before and after making mods, the change in coast down time itself is MUCH more meaningful than any change in Cd or Crr extracted from the coast down data.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FDD/HD1J/F5Y3TMFE/FDDHD1JF5Y3TMFE.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Results"}], "channel": "Cars"}, {"category": "workshop", "description": "My sister and I recently moved into an apartment together, and as a trade I gave her the significantly larger room and she let me set up my lathe on the balcony.

I want to encourage customization in the sense that you can make a project fit perfectly for your needs, kind of in the #BuiltNotBought mindset.

To determine the width of your shoe rack, I suggest laying the two dowels parallel to each other and setting down however many pairs of shoes you would like to have per row (I did 4 pairs and ended up just over 30\"). Measure this length and add 1\" (each end will be inserted 1/2\" into the sides of the rack). Make sure the shoes fit on the dowels comfortably; they don't need to slide in like a dovetail joint. Making it too tight of a fit will cause issues removing and replacing the shoes. Side note: If you face one shoe forward, and the other backward, the curves fit together better and they take up less width.Most of my shoes have a similar height, except for my hiking boots, so I put those on top and based the height on the rest of the shoes. All four corner posts are the same height. You will notice that each end of the shoe rack is an H frame. The length of the cross-piece for these is fairly arbitrary; it just needs to be wide enough so that the shoes do not fall off if the rack is bumped. After cutting the four posts I simply took the leftover from the 6' piece of poplar, and cut it in half.Now that our pieces are cut, we need to drill a couple of holes. First, we need to mark the depth cuts we will drill for the dowels. I used the measuring tape and speed square to mark the center of each of the four posts, then marked where to drill at the top and halfway down the post (see pic).

The lever is placed back in its original position and the ratchet is placed in the next notch to allow for another five to ten degrees of bending.

It can be used to make lines perpendicular (square) to a board's edge. And it can be used to mark any angle (between 0 and 90 degrees) across a board's face. There are many other ways the speed square can be used, but I will focus on these two in this tutorial.\u00a0Why is a triangle called a square? Merriam-Webster defines a square as:\u00a0a four-sided shape that is made up of four straight sides that are the same length and that has four right angles.\u00a0 It is the four right angles that defines our tool. The speed square only has one right angle, but one of it's main purposes is to quickly define a square line across a board, a line 90 degrees ( a right angle) to the edge of a board. For more on the history of the Swanson speed square you may watch this video.", "title": "How to Read a Speed Square", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Read-a-Speed-Square/", "section": "workshop", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "As you look at your speed square you will notice that there are many different scales; common, degrees,\u00a0hip/val (Hip and Valley for specific roofs), inches along the side. We will look at two of those scales in a bit, but first I want to point out some key features that allow the square to work as it does.LIP-\u00a0In this picture you'll notice the lip labeled along the left side. If you look at your square, the lip is the bit that is wider than the rest of the square, the part that makes it not sit flat on the table. The lip is what we use to hook on to the edge of a board to know that we have the square where we want it. \u00a0It gives us our reference point.PIVOT-\u00a0In this picture you'll see the pivot in the bottom left-hand corner. The pivot point is the point at which we rotate the square when we are looking to mark an angle other than 90 degrees. It is the basis for reading all angles.HYPOTENUSE-\u00a0This is long side of any triangle. On a speed square it is the edge at which we read the degree scale. This is all you need to know about it for now, but I will refer to the hypotenuse later, so I want to make sure you know which edge it is.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F1E/NE8U/HT73L501/F1ENE8UHT73L501.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Identify the Main Features of a Speed Square"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "First let's review that we know which scale is the degree scale. There are two simple ways to know that you are looking at the correct part of the square to read degrees. The degree scale is the outermost one, the one that lies directly along the hypotenuse. It is also labeled DEGREES or DEG. It should have numbers ranging from 0 (where the hypotenuse meets the lip) to 90 (farthest away from the lip).Got it! Now that you are looking at the correct scale, it's time to find an angle. Take a board, a 2 x 4 \u00a0or 1 x 4 works fine, and hold the square so the lip is flat against the long edge of the board and the square lies across the face of the board. LIke the picture, only the lip will be completely along the edge of the board. The edge that is square to the lip should run straight across the face of the board forming your 90 degree angle.\u00a0 Notice where the pivot point is. This is always going to stay on the edge of the board. The edge of the lip that the hypotenuse abuts is going to move. Pivot stays, hypotenuse moves.\u00a0 Do you see in the picture how the edge of the board forms a ray from the pivot out to the degree scale? With the pivot point of the lip still against the edge of the board, look at where the edge of the board passes through the degree scale. That number is your angle. In this picture, the square is held at 25 degrees.Marking your board-\u00a0Now that your square is in the right position you need to draw your line so you know what to cut or how to position your pieces.\u00a0ALWAYS DRAW YOUR LINE OUT OF THE PIVOT POINT.\u00a0What this means is that your line should run along the square edge from the lip. 90 degrees from the lip. Along the edge that reads inches.\u00a0DO NOT DRAW ALONG THE HYPOTENUSE.\u00a0", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FEL/8BTH/HT7P95SZ/FEL8BTHHT7P95SZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Using the Degree Scale"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Using the common scale is the same as the degree scale. First we need to make sure that we are looking at the correct scale. The common scale is marked as such,\u00a0COMMON. It has numbers that range from 1 to 30. The common scale is the next scale in from the hypotenuse.\u00a0GOT IT! What is the common scale? The common scale is used to read pitch, for roofs as an example. Roof angles could be identified by degrees but more commonly they are defined by pitch. If you remember back to math class, pitch is defined by rise over run. Run is a certain amount of distance along something. Rise is a certain distance up from something. In construction the run is defined as a constant 12, as in inches in a foot. The rise that occurs over the the 12, gives you your pitch. It does not matter if you are reading in inches, feet, or even (for some reason) centimeters. As long as your run is a multiple of 12, your rise will be in the common scale.\u00a0Calculator.net has more information about roof pitches. In the picture, I held my pivot point on the edge of the board and rotated my hypotenuse down. I read this scale as 7. Which is also 7 in 12, or 7/12, or 7 over 12. These all mean the same thing, For every 12 I go over, I will go 7 up. If it is 12 inches over, I will go 7 inches up. If it is 12 feet over, I will go 7 feet up. If I want my trim board to be cut at the correct pitch to match the roof, I can just use the common scale of 7. That way it doesn't matter how much I go up or over, I am at the same pitch.\u00a0REMINDER:\u00a0Be sure to mark your board along the square edge. The edge that runs away from the pivot point at a 90 degree angle to the lip. This is the most common mistake I see.\u00a0", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F0N/W0C2/HT7P95UI/F0NW0C2HT7P95UI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRT/V05I/HT8O2PVY/FRTV05IHT8O2PVY.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Using the Common Scale"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "You surely have noticed that there are many other scales and markings on the speed square.

Aviation has been a passion of mine all my life, and has led me to pursue my aerospace engineering degree.  As a engineering student I know that I still have much to learn, but that there also a lot that I can teach since I have been flying, building, and designing airplanes for about 10 years.  To design any airplane the first task is always to define what its mission will be.  This will be the guiding force behind all research that is conducted and all design choices that will be made.  For me I choose to design a fighter styled after the great piston engine fighters of WW2.  Therefore my research began with finding various parent aircraft to look at for design inspiration. These included the P-51 Mustang, BF-109, P-40, Spitfire as well as several WW2 fighters turned racers.  These aircraft were all designed in different environments worlds apart and yet were effective in their mission through unique solutions.This Instructable will go through the design process as applicable to many different airplane configurations, and the trade offs associated with different designs.  I will then show how I built my airplane showcasing the many different wood working and fiberglassing techniques required to build a similar airplane. From this Instructable you will see all of the techniques used and the challenges overcome to build a beautiful airplane.  This Instructable should therefore be considered a reference of various building techniques, that will allow a moderately experienced RC enthusiast to design and construct a custom RC airplane.  I hope that this will provide the knowledge and serve as a guide to anyone designing and building a custom airplane.9-13-2015 UPDATEI have finally had to opportunity and the nerves to fly the airplane.  I have linked a video of the maiden flight in the last step, and am please to say she flew beautifully.  Thank all of you for your support and kind reviews of this instructable.In Regards to the Epilog VI ContestThis Iinstructable is entered in the Epilog VI contest to win a laser cutter.  If I were to win a laser cutter it would provide me with the ability to expand my craft and share it with others.  Designing and building has always been a passion of mine, and a laser cutter would allow me to turn my ideas into reality very quickly.  A laser cutter would be my most prize piece of equipment in my toolbox. In Regard to the Remote Control ContestThe macbook and the GoPro would go a long way in ensure this airplane will reach its full potential.  Just think how awesome it would be to have a GoPro mounted on the wing of this airplane cruising around at 80mph.  It would complete this airplane.

Efficient because the larger main wing is more efficient than the smaller tail at producing lift      Canard- Both the wing and the canard produce the lift for the airplane.  The canard will often stall before the main wing, and will therefore require a larger wing than a conventional wing since the wing will not be able to reach its highest lift coefficient before the canard stall.      Delta-efficient for high speed flight.  The wing can reach higher lift coefficients since a vortex will roll over the leading edge,  this occurs at high angles of attack.      Flying wing- The tail is integrated into the wing.  This is achieved by means of using reflexed airfoils to counter the airfoils nose down pitching moment.  Yaw control can be obtained through use of a drag rudder or through wing tip rudders if the wing has sufficient sweep.  Flying wings are very sensitive to the location of the center of gravity.Wing- All wing characteristics are considered with no wing twist.  Wing twist will change the lift distribution across the wing, and also the stall characteristics Rectangular-  Easiest to build since it will have the same shape along the entire span.  This wing shape is very forgiving and will stall from the root outward. Tapered- A slightly tapered wing will be more aerodynamically efficient than a rectangular wing.  It may be more challenging to build based on the desired taper.  This wing will stall from the midsection and move in towards the root and out to the tip. Elliptical- Planform of minimum induced drag(drag from lift).  Fabrication is difficult since all ribs are different sizes and do not uniformly change in size.  Complex curves will develop on the aircraft skin that will be difficult to cover.  Just think how few commercial and military airplanes have use this planform. This wing will stall violently all at once. Double or triple tapered wing-  Used to increase the efficiency of a tapered wing by making its lift distribution closer to that of an elliptical wing.  Stalls similar to an elliptical wing.Tail      T-Tail- Raises the tail above the downwash of the wing, and away from possible ground hazards.  This type of tail requires a reinforced vertical stabilizer since it must take the loads from the horizontal stabilizer as well as the rudder      Cruciform tail- Raises the tail partially above the base of the vertical stabilizer for many of the benefits of the T-tail but with reduced structural loads.     H Tail- Excellent for twin boom configurations or for when increased vertical stabilizer area is required.        V Tail/ Inverted V- Less efficient than a conventional tail since lifting forces are pointing in a direction other than the desired on increasing drag during maneuvers.

Radio interference even with modern 2.4 ghz transmitters can be in issue for aircraft utilizing carbon as a primary building material.

Additionally since the required techniques have been used for many years an abundance of information exists on the subject from build to covering the model.

This can include construction techniques, transportation to and from the flying site, flight capabilities such as range, ability to handle wind, runways (water, grass, paved, hand launched\u2026.).  These are just among the factors that will set the size of the aircraft.From this point sizing becomes an iterative process of working with the components for which the weights are known, ie electronics, and then working to take a first guess of what the airframe will weigh.  This can be difficult to do so it is best to itemize the components and then work to build up an entire airplane.  For example the weight of the wing could be approximated by approximating the weight of the material that will be used to make the spar, then guessing how many sheets of balsa it will take to build the wing ribs, and cover the wings. Additionally components such as the leading edge and possibly a drag spar must be considered.

They are a fast to check and are worth calculating rather than just eyeballing the design.  I have provided the values I calculated for the airplane I designed.The first term is the to be found is the mean aerodynamic cord (MAC).  It can be found geometrically by adding the root cord in front of and behind the tip, and also by adding the tip cord infront of and behind the root. These points are then connected to make an X.  The cord length at the intersection of the X is the MAC. The aerodynamic center of the wing section is simply  0.25 times the MAC. The aerodynamic center must be found for both the wing and tail surfaces. The neutral point of the aircraft must be found next.  It is used to determine the location of the center of gravity of the airplane, and is calculated with the aerodynamic center. Next the static margin of the airplane must be determined.  The static margin is a measure of stability of the airplane, the higher it is the more stable the airplane, and the lower the less stable.  However if the airplane is too stable it will not be maneuverable and thus not controlable, and if it is too unstable then it will be to maneuverable to be controllable by a human.  Therefore for most aircraft it ranges between 5 and 15 percent. Lastly the tail volume coefficients should be calculated.  These terms are used to compare the effectiveness of the tail in reference to the size of the wing and the distance the tail is from the wing.  The tail volume for the vertical tail generally ranges between 0.35 and 0.8   The tail volume of the horizontal tail generally ranges between 0.02 and 0.05", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FB7/5P8A/HZI95PG9/FB75P8AHZI95PG9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F24/UO6L/HZI95PH5/F24UO6LHZI95PH5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXF/JFND/HZI95PHG/FXFJFNDHZI95PHG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Stability"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Transmitter- The controller held by the pilot and used to broadcast the radio signals to the receiver on the airplane.

It will tell you if the design and sizing is feasible or if the design needs to be revised.  I recommend making a spread sheet to aid in this step since it will allow the design to be iterated quickly(My spreadsheet can be found on the my design process step).  First begin with components that are fixed in weight for the airplane such as servos and receivers.  Then begin estimating the weight of either the entire airplane and then try to break that over down into the weight of the  wing, tail, fuselage, gear, and power system.  At this stage the mission of the airplane will determine how much power is required and therefore the weight of the power system.  If at this point the airplanes weight has resulted in an excessive wing area then it is time to reevaluate the design, sizing, and fabrication techniques.  Additionally at this stage it is important to verify that the take off speed will be acceptable.  To do this use the lift equation below and either enter Cl max for the airfoil or a conservative value of Cl which would be in the ballpark of 1.1.L=1/2*rho*v^2*s*Cl", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 9: Weight Estimation"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "Designing a light and efficient power system is a must for any aircraft to take to the skies.  For an electric powered model the best setup that is available is a brushless motor with a lipo battery.  However, there are a thousand possible combinations leaving us with the question of where to start.Determine the level of performance that you desire out of the airplane.  From here there are general guidelines for how many watts of power per pound are required.  Check out the link below for the most common rule of thumbs  http://www.rc-airplane-world.com/watts-per-pound.htmlOnce the power required is found the next step is looking for motors that are capable of putting out that much power. While comparing it is important to look at the current and power limit to ensure that you will stay within the Spec.  Brushless motors speed are measured by kv. kv stands for rpm per volt, so a high kv motor will spin faster than a low kv motor.  High kv motors are often limited to smaller models and ducted fans.  Lower kv motors will produce higher torque but will spin slower, to compensate these often run a a higher voltage.  As a general statement to produce the same power a high kv motor will spin a smaller prop faster while pulling a higher current(higher current=lower battery life) compared to a low kv motor that will spin a larger prop much slower and with a much lower current draw but at a higher voltage.  The final motor setup is a trade off between efficiency and battery size. I highly recommend using a motor calculator to find the performance of the motor prior to buying it. Ecalc is a easy to use subscription web app that contains many motors and propellers and allows you to essentially try different combinations before ever buying one.  This will also tell you the current draw of the setup you have chosen as well as thrust measurements. http://www.ecalc.ch/An ESC must be selected that can handle the desired voltage and current of the motor.  Additionally if the airplanes electrics will be powered off of the BEC built into the ESC, then it is important to ensure that it is capable of providing sufficient current for all of the servos.  Be sure to oversize the ESC by at least 20% to provide a safety margin for operation. Lastly the battery must be selected.  Selecting too small of a battery for the application is dangerous and will result in damaging the batteries cells on the of best days.  Lipo batteries come rated by the number of cells in series, ie higher \"S\" count the higher the voltage.  The capacity of the battery is rated in mah, and the discharge rate in C.  To find the max current able to be extracted from the battery take the capacity in mah divide by 1000 and then multiply by the C rating.  Be sure to add a margin of safety in the discharge rate because some batteries are \"overrated\" and as cells age performance is lost.

I also knew that I wanted to make it fully sheeted with balsa and fiberglass, because I love the look of wood.  Additionally, I wanted to include retractable landing gear to not only reduce drag, but also to make the airplane look more complete in the air. From the outset these requirements made it the hardest but most rewarding airplane that I have ever designed and fabricated.  I encourage anyone who has been flying to try to design and build at least one airplane of your own, whether it is simple or complex it is a great learning experience. Below is the preliminary steps I took to design the airplane.Sketch the airplane-  First I drew my preliminary design sketch on graph paper without any dimensions.  This allows you to scale the sketch to any size that you want and will allow the wing area to be found for different wingspans.   Weight estimation- Once the preliminary wing area was found I then started making a weight build up of all of the major components.  This stage was very much a reality check.  My initial plan was to have a 45 inch wingspan however with the components, and the weight of the wing sheeting I quickly found that the airplane would have too high of a wingloading.  Therefore I re-scaled my preliminary drawing to have a 60 inch wingspan (Wing area=630in^2) not counting the wingtips. This proved to be a much more sound design and have attached the preliminary weight build up spreadsheet to this step.  As you can see I measured the weight of the materials that I was using with the following averages listing below.  These allowed me to estimate the weight of the various components.  For example the weight of the balsa sheeting was found by multiplying the wing area times 2 (for the top and bottom of the wing) by the weight of balsa per square foot.  This same method was used on the rudder and elevator.  For the fuselage I found the  side area and added it to the top area of the fuselage, then multipled that by 2 and then by the weight per square foot.  Basswood .24oz/in^3   Balsa 1/32\" .42oz/ft^2   Balsa 1/16\" .85oz/ft^2Stability-After I estimated the weight  I calculated the stability criteria as describe in the stability section to validate that my airplane would be stable and that they tails were adequately sized  Airfoil selection- Choosing the correct airfoil for the airplane being built will ensure the airplane will fly exactly how you would hope it would.  Below is a link to a very simple to use airfoil analysis tool. For the planform that I have designed tip stalling could be an issue since the tip chord is half of the root chord.  If at all possible bad tip stalling characteristics should be designed out of the airplane, since tip stalls will result in the wingtip dropping rapidly with no way to regain role control until airspeed is raised.  I have achieved this through the use of washout (twisting the wing tips down) and through careful selection of root and tip airfoils.  At the root I have selected the S8036 it is 16 percent thick meaning that the wing thickness will be 16 percent of the chord.  This will allow for a large spar for increased strength and also for landing gear to easily fit inside of the wing. For the wing tip the S8037 was selected.  It is also 16 percent thick.  It stalls at a higher lift coefficient and also at a higher angle of attack than the S8036 at the same Reynolds number (Reynolds number is a fluid mechanics term used to compare specimens that in our case are different sizes.  The higher the Reynolds number the larger the chord), this means that the root if at the same Reynolds number (same chord as tip) would stall first and thus the airplane would maintain role control.  However since the root is twice the chord of the tip it will have twice the Reynolds number, and increasing Reynolds number tends to delay stall.  Therefore I twisted the wing tips down so that they will stall after the root.http://airfoiltools.com/compare/index", "step_imgs": ["/assets/img/pixel.png"], "step_title": "Step 12: My Design Process"}, {"step": 13, "steps_text": "Once I had the design completed I wanted to validate the design before putting the time to build one from balsa.  To to this I scaled down my plans to half scale.  Using this new plan I made a glider version of the airplane out of foamcore.  I began by cutting out the side view of the fuselage and then elevator.  I then cut a slot into the fuselage for the tail to slide in.  Note that the tail is mounting with the leading edge below the trailing edge ie. at a negative angle of attack.  For a conventional configuration airplane with a wing in front of the tail this is critical for stability.  To hold the two wing halves together I glued some small pieces of wire into the wing and slid them into the other wing half.  Then i put the airplane together with packaging tape and added a ball of clay to the nose to get the CG at the desired location.To test the airplane I threw it around outside beginning with simple tosses to see how it flew and trimmed.  Then i began testing to see how it would recover from stalls, for stability the airplane should nose down and pickup airspeed.

This is generally accomplished through the use of a central spar which is made up of spar caps, that are the upper and lower flanges on the beam, and the shear web, the thin sheeting that connects the spar caps.  Although the shear web is thin it will greatly increase the wings bending strength by unifying the structure.  Also very common are smaller drag spars in front of the trailing edge.  These can take bending loads as well as serving to increase the torsional rigidity of the wing.  Lastly the leading edge may be sheeted back to the spar creating closed cross section beam, this is called a D-tube and it is designed to very efficiently take the torsional loads generated by the wing.  Shown are a few very common spar designs. The top wing has a I-beam spar, with the shear web located in the center of the spar caps, it also has a sheeted leading edge called a D-tube. The D-tube is designed to increase the torsional rigidity of the wing, and can be added to any of the other spar designs, as well as extended to the trailing edge to create a fully sheeted wing. On this wing the trailing drag spar is simply a vertical support. It also has a simple top hinged control surface, which is easy to fabricate.       The second wing has a C-beam spar, with a stronger drag spar which is better able to handle the drag loads placed on it.  It  has a centered hinge, this hinge reduces the gap and thus the drag as compared to a top hinge.        The third wing has a tube spar, these are usually made from carbon tubes, and are very convenient to build with, if the carbon tube is unidirectional/pultruded then wing twisting can be an issue, but this can be managed with the addition of a D-tube.  Furthermore the drag spar is a C-beam which would greatly increase the rigidity of the wing. The hinge is a rounded control surface with the pivot point in the center point of the circular leading edge to minimize the hinge gap and to have smooth edges.        The fourth wing has a fully boxed spar with shear webbing on both the front and back of the spar.  The hinge features the same control surface as the previously discussed wing, but has fairing on the top and bottom of the wings trailing edge to close the hinge line.All of these are common ways to built the spar and make the hinge line on a RC airplane.  These are by no means the only ways to do it, and the various spar designs and hinge types can all be exchanged to create the desired wing.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FPJ/LLVB/HZB3JEMZ/FPJLLVBHZB3JEMZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 16: Wing Structural Design"}, {"step": 17, "steps_text": "For the airplane that I am building I chose to use a wooden C-beam spar with a solid leading edge and a simple vertical drag spar.  The entire wing is sheeted in balsa for torsional rigidity and for aesthetics.Wood was chosen over a composite tube because the airplane is designed with 2 degrees of dihedral and the joint in the center of a composite tube wing would difficult to make strong enough to withstand the bending load.  The I-beam was also less favorable than the C-beam since it would be much more difficult to fabricated, since a slot would need to be made running the length of the spar for the shear web to be installed into.  This added complexity is not made up for by a noticeable increase in the strength to weight ratio of the spar.  The box beam was not chosen because of the increased weight, however this would not have been more difficult to build and would also have been stronger.  The simple vertical drag spar combined with the hinge fairing was selected since the entire wing is sheeted and would be strong enough without any additional supports.Spar- The wing spar is designed to carry the bending load created from the lift being generated by the wing.  It is not designed to support the twisting caused by aerodynamic forces on the wing, that load is instead carried by the wing skin.  This load sharing allows for a light and very efficient structure since each part is supporting the load that it is most efficient at handling.The spar caps are made from \u00bc x \u00bd x 24\u201d pieces of basswood.  Basswood was chosen for the since it is a hardwood with a very straight grain, furthermore it is very strong for its weight.  Convenient sizes can be readily purchased from craft stores which was important due to my lack of sufficient tools to cut strips of a wood from this hard of a material.   The shear web is made from 1/32\u201d thick basswood sheeting, and is glued between the upper and lower spar caps to join the structure.  Shear webbing is absolutely necessary in a wing since it dramatically increases the rigidity and strength of the wing for very little weight.   The trailing edge /  drag spar is made from 1/16\u201d thick balsa sheeting, it helps add to torsional rigidity while also unifying the wing ribs to allow the control surfaces to be mounted to the back of the ribs.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 17: Wing Structual Design Continued"}, {"step": 18, "steps_text": "Creating ribs for a tapered wing can be challenging.  A few methods are prevalent the first is cutting out a template for the root airfoil and the tip airfoil.  These are then stacked at end of a pile of airfoil blanks and bolted together the whole stack is then sanded.   This method is exceptionally good for creating straight wings.  However the amount of taper that is achievable using this method is limited because of the angle that is created between the two templates grows with quickly with the difference between root and tip cord.  This large angle will make it difficult to assemble the wing later on due to the large amount of excess wood and sharp angles on the edges of the ribs that will need to be removed.  Therefore the only method that I had available to me was to make my own templates for each rib and then cut and sand each rib until it was the perfect fit.  This is exceptionally challenging on this airplane since the root airfoil is not the same as the tip airfoil so all the airfoils in between those are a combination of those two.  Additionally since the wing is fully sheeted the rib shape must be adjusted to compensate for the thickness of the sheeting. Below I present the method that I used to create my ribs templates, it is done using Autodesk Autocad 2012 Student Addition which is my preferred CAD software for designing RC airplane plans in, since I learned it in high school and have used it through out college.  The pictures in this step are all labeled with the step that they go along with.To import an airfoil into autocad the fastest method that I have found has been to open the airfoil text file with excel so that it will organize the data(these files for many airfoils can be found on the UIUC airfoil database).  Then insert a column between the x and y data and fill each box with a comma, and verify that the first point and the last point are in the same location so the the program creates a closed object. Then copy this data back into the txt file and save it.  Once it is saved go back and highlight all of the data making sure not to include any headings.  Then in Autocad launch the \u201cspline\u201d command and paste when it asks you for the first point.  Hit enter and until the command prompt finishes the command.  Airfoil data is generally formatted such that the cord is 1 unit as such it is very easy to scale the airfoil to the appropriate size simply by using the desired cord as the scaling factor.    Draw the airfoils and align them as dictated by the planform.  Note that the wing tip(the little airfoil) is set at 2 degree nose down in comparison to the wing root. The leading edge and spars must be carefully sized in the drawing since the end product will be the sheeting on the wing, therefor the the spars must be drawn narrower than they are. It is preferable to make the spars and the leading edge taller than required to make the drawing go smoother.  Also the spar notches are located such a way that the entire spar will fit in the rib while remain square.    Here the airfoil sections are shown at each end before they are lofted together to form the intermediate airfoil sections.    The wing spar and the sub leading edge are lofted to allow them to be subtracted from the wing later on.    Now the airfoils are lofted creating the shape of the wing while also having the location of the spar and sub leading edge visible.    The spar and sub leading edge have been removed using \u201csubtract\u201d leaving the outer shape of the wing, minus the leading edge which is not part of the ribs.    The wing is then hollowed out using \u201csolidedit\u201d and then selecting \u201cshell\u201d.  The wing tip and root were then selected as the faces to remove, and what is left is the wing skin.  Therefore the inner wall of the wing skin is the rib shape.    Now using the \u201csection plane\u201d button at each of the wing rib locations a cross-section of the wing will be generated.    Then under \u201csection plane\u201d select generate section.  With this command the cross sections at all of the stations already made can be displayed by generating a section for ever rib.  To aid in aligning the wing ribs during construction I highly recomend drawing a horizontal line from the trailing edge of the wing through the leading edge.  This will allow you to correctly align the wing if it is being build with twist  and will also help in making the wing straight.    Again since these templates are actually the wing skin the inside of the innermost line is the correct one to cut on.    Now with the ribs all labeled using the \"text\" command they are ready to be printed.  Around each page of ribs I have made a print box to allow for easy repeatable printing.  The box will not print since it is in a separate layer that is turned off from printing but is still displayed on the screen.  I will be printing out all of the smaller ribs on resume paper since it is a heavier stock it will make for a nicer template.  The larger airfoils will be printed on regular paper and then reinforced before the ribs are cut", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FC7/X7ZF/HZCIYTI3/FC7X7ZFHZCIYTI3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXH/IW6X/HZCIYTJE/FXHIW6XHZCIYTJE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBI/WPN2/HZCIYTLB/FBIWPN2HZCIYTLB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHY/IM09/HZCIYTDN/FHYIM09HZCIYTDN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTG/YRCA/HZCIYTF5/FTGYRCAHZCIYTF5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM6/GIN7/HZCIYTF8/FM6GIN7HZCIYTF8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWX/GFVN/HZCIYTG2/FWXGFVNHZCIYTG2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9A/CLTB/HZCIYTGQ/F9ACLTBHZCIYTGQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZA/NXDS/HZCIYTHS/FZANXDSHZCIYTHS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FK5/XIP5/HZCIYTHV/FK5XIP5HZCIYTHV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 18: Designing Wig Ribs"}, {"step": 19, "steps_text": "All of the non-structural wing ribs are made from 1/16\" thick balsa wood with the grain running in the cordwise direction to provide rigidity from the leading edge to the trailing edge.  I printed the templates that were made in CAD onto resume paper since it is thinker and produces a very nice template.  I then put double sided tape on the back of the templates and cut them out, this ensures that double sided tape covers the entire backside and prevents having to cut the tape and wood at the same time with a razor.  Once the first wing rib is cut put double sided tape on to the back of it and then stick it on to another piece of 1/16\" balsa and cut out another rib, this will yield both the right and left rib.With the ribs for both wings still stuck together and with the template still attached sand the ribs to the innermost line on the template.  I recomend sanding across the grain or in other words through the template, or else the template will tend to roll up or bend instead of sanding.  Sanding both the right and left wing together ensures a symmetric wing.With the rib sets all stacked together it is easy to see why sanding between the root and tip ribs would produce issues.  The steep angles made by the tip cord compared to the root cord would leave angles along all of the ribs with the worst being left at the leading edge and trailing edge.

As such balsa would not be able to support the loads experienced by these ribs, so instead this ribs are made from 1/32\" thick basswood and 2oz fiberglass to make a composite plywood that is incredibly strong and much less brittle than craft ply wood.  The process that is being used to apply the fiberglass called a wet layup since the resin is being used to wet the fibers. These ribs will experience a large load in front of the spar however very little behind it, therefore to keep the airplane as light as possible the front of the rib will be much more heavily reinforced than the rear. Below is the first stage of building the reinforced ribs.First cut the rib shape from from 1/32\" basswood and sand the rib as done on the previous ribs.    Trace the wing rib shape onto 2 oz fiberglass leaving about 1/2\" around the outside of the ribs as shown in the photos.  it is important to have the fiberglass weave running from the leading edge to the trailing edge and from the bottom to the top of the rib.  This maximizes the strength of the part by allowing for continuous fibers along the length of the part.    Prepare a working surface by taping down a sheet of painter plastic to apply the fiberglass and resin on.     Next prepare the surfaces which will be in contact with the parts as the cure.  Here wax paper is covered with packaging tape to create a very smooth and nonporous surface. Then apply release wax to the packaging tape with a paper towel according to the packaging instructions. As a personal preference, I use Megular's Mirror Glaze Mold Release Wax, it works very well with the Z-Poxy finishing resin that I use and once cured the parts very easily separate from any smooth surface where the wax was applied.  It also does not leave very much residue on the parts once separated. Now that all the surfaces are prepared make sure that there is plenty of ventilation, and that extra gloves and squeegees are easily available.  I like to use either playing cards or the plastic from old clam shell packaging as a squeegee because they are either cheep or free and also disposable to avoid the harsh solvents required to clean a reusable squeegee    Mix the resin which you will be using to laminate the wood and fiberglass with.    Pour some resin onto the wood and use a squeegee to evenly spread it across the surface.  Then remove any excess with the squeegee. This will aid in the fiberglass cloth laminating to the wood. Pour some resin onto the fiberglass cloth and use the squeegee fully coat the cloth.  The cloth will change from white to a translucent color as it absorbs the resin.    Squeegee off all the excess resin from the fiberglass cloth, being sure to only run the squeegee with the grain of the cloth.    Now gently pick up the wetted piece of cloth, the squeegee may be needed to help peel it off of the working surface and place it on the rib blank.    Squeegee the cloth again this will help to adhere the fiberglass to the wood, again you will see a change in color as the glass bonds to the wood.    Now pick up the rib and place it fiberglass down on the waxed surface.    Repeat the wetting process to the rib and to the fiberglass cloth and apply to to the other side of the rib.    Once all the other ribs have been given similar treatment lay a second waxed sheet on top of the ribs.  At this point you can use your hands or a dry squeegee to remove any air bubbles between the waxed surface and the ribs.    Place something flat on top of the ribs, in my case it was a piece of foam core.  Then place as much weight as you can onto the ribs.  This will help to adhere the the fiberglass to the sub-straight, as well as squeezing out any excess resin.    Let the resin fully cure, per the manufactures specs. Remove the weight and pull off the waxed surface.  If the waxed sheet is not damaged it can be saved to use again.    Wipe down the fiberglass with rubbing alcohol to remove any wax residue. Excess fiberglass around the edges can often be first cut with scissors. With gloves, a respirator, safety glasses and plenty of ventilation the remaining fiberglass can be sanded back to the size of the wooden rib.  Additionally the entire surface of the rib should be roughed up so that more layers of resin will be able to adhere to the surface.Congratulations if you have made it this far, you have just completed your first wet lay up, but there are more required to finish this airplane.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F32/6B9T/HZCIYZC5/F326B9THZCIYZC5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSK/X6J7/HZCIYZCE/FSKX6J7HZCIYZCE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6Z/BTUW/HZCIYZG0/F6ZBTUWHZCIYZG0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXM/6J7B/HZCIYZDL/FXM6J7BHZCIYZDL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F99/69XJ/HZCIYZCL/F9969XJHZCIYZCL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F04/1YA4/HZCIYZJD/F041YA4HZCIYZJD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXX/4VPQ/HZCIYZHV/FXX4VPQHZCIYZHV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWD/HFYQ/HZCIZ0MB/FWDHFYQHZCIZ0MB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRR/6VEH/HZCIYZKW/FRR6VEHHZCIYZKW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKK/4GTV/HZCIYZNH/FKK4GTVHZCIYZNH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTE/U6OO/HZCIYZNS/FTEU6OOHZCIYZNS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHS/M7R6/HZCIYZQ9/FHSM7R6HZCIYZQ9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJM/4Z1E/HZCIYZRF/FJM4Z1EHZCIYZRF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEW/T3VP/HZCIYZRX/FEWT3VPHZCIYZRX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWS/HHU8/HZCIYZSO/FWSHHU8HZCIYZSO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6Q/DUBM/HZCIYZT9/F6QDUBMHZCIYZT9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGZ/ZJZE/HZCIYZWT/FGZZJZEHZCIYZWT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXT/EEUU/HZCIYZYD/FXTEEUUHZCIYZYD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1K/1Y5V/HZCIYZYL/F1K1Y5VHZCIYZYL.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 20: Wing Fabrication: Landing Gear Ribs Stage 1"}, {"step": 21, "steps_text": "The next stage of reinforcing the landing gear brackets is reinforcing the front of the rib from where it attaches to the wing spar forward to where it attaches to the sub leading edge.  This is accomplished by adding more layers of wood and fiberglass to turn the rib into a very solid piece of fiberglass reinforced plywood.Cut out the pieces of wood which will be laminated on.  In my case I added a layer of wood with the grain running vertically and then a piece of wood with the grain running in the cord-wise direction on both sides of the rib.  This makes the front 5 plys of wood thick with 6 layers of fiberglass.   Next cut out the plys of 2oz fiberglass that will be needed for the laminate sandwich. Prepare the working surface as before with painter plastic and if reusing the waxed sheet apply a new layer of wax to it for good measure. Mix and prepare the resin. Coat the leading edge of the rib with resin and squeegee off the excess. Coat the wood with the grain running vertically with resin and squeegee the excess. Wet the fiberglass and apply to the to side of the wood with the vertical grain.   Apply the vertically grained piece of wood to the rib blank ensuring that there is resin on the wood block being added to ensure proper lamination. Apply the fiberglass to the block just added to the rib and squeegee off any excess resin. Wet and apply the wooden block with the grain running in the cord-wise direction to the rib. Apply a layer of fiberglass onto the to of the cord-wise grained block. Place the fiberglassed side down on the waxed sheet. Repeat steps 5-11 to the other side of the rib and to all remaining ribs. Apply waxed sheet onto the top of all of the ribs. Compress the laminate as done previously. Allow the resin to cure and then removed from waxed sheet. Clean surfaces with rubbing alcohol. With the appropriate safety precautions remove the excess from the ribs.  A coping saw can help to get close to the rough shape.  It is also possible to carve the excess away with a very sharp razor.  Sand to the final shape and rough the surface to that it can be written on easily.   Using the rib templates determine the correct placement of the spar notches and cut them out using a razor saw, once cut a razor can be used to finely adjust the fit.   Determine where the cross member must be placed to mount the landing gear on.  Be sure to leave enough room for the landing gear to retract fully, as well as enough room in front of the spar to allow the wheels to not hit when retracting.  Also it is important to take into account if the wing had dihedral since the gear will then either have to not extend 90 degrees or it will need to be mounted at an angle in the wing, in my case it is mounted in the wing at an angle.   Once the location is determined a starter hole can be made with a small drill bit in my case 3/16\" since the cross member running between ribs are 1/4x1/2\". After the starter holes are drilled the rest will likely need to be done again with a very sharp razor.  This will be time consuming but be patient since these must support the weight of the airplane and be carefully aligned so that the gear will retract into the wing and extend and be straight.The landing gear ribs are now complete.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FV7/PZF4/HZCIZ9GM/FV7PZF4HZCIZ9GM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F16/HRM4/HZCIZ9GZ/F16HRM4HZCIZ9GZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP0/U54Y/HZCIZ9HI/FP0U54YHZCIZ9HI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F07/QUCR/HZCIZ9I5/F07QUCRHZCIZ9I5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXE/1030/HZCIZ9JN/FXE1030HZCIZ9JN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5G/W9SJ/HZCIZ9KH/F5GW9SJHZCIZ9KH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ7/OXGD/HZCIZ9L5/FQ7OXGDHZCIZ9L5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCM/FD14/HZCIZ9LQ/FCMFD14HZCIZ9LQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW9/RKE9/HZCIZA5M/FW9RKE9HZCIZA5M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPW/KN17/HZCIZA22/FPWKN17HZCIZA22.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1Q/OSHF/HZCIZA12/F1QOSHFHZCIZA12.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEB/J6CH/HZCIZA8Z/FEBJ6CHHZCIZA8Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDU/0ZY1/HZCIZ9VT/FDU0ZY1HZCIZ9VT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8T/R8EQ/HZCIZ9X4/F8TR8EQHZCIZ9X4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPB/AL0D/HZCIZ9Y6/FPBAL0DHZCIZ9Y6.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 21: Wing Fabrication: Landing Gear Ribs Stage 2"}, {"step": 22, "steps_text": "The center rib along with the rib on either side of it are reinforced to support the mounting bracket for the fuselage.

The outer plys have the grain running in the chordwise direction. Cut out the rib blanks out of 1/32\" basswood with the grain running in the chordwise direction leaving them slightly over sized they will be sanded to final size in a later step. Since basswood does not come in wide enough sheets to have the chord length fit with the grain running vertically through it, strips must be joint to create these sheets. Glue strips of 1/32\" bass wood together to make a strip as long as the rib with the grain running vertically.    Cut out the 2oz fiberglass cloth with excess to cover the ribs.

The spar is the critical load path for the airplane, all loads generated from the fuselage are transmitted through it.  As such it is of the up most importance that the wing spar is strong enough to withstand the loads it will be subjected to.  The weakest point of any structure is a joint, do not take shortcuts to make it easier at the cost of strength.  Therefore I will show how to build joints on the wing spar that will be as strong as the surrounding wood to ensure the integrity of the finished wing.  These joints are called scarf joints. Make a jig to hold the spar stock while cutting.     Line up two of the strips and the cut the angle the desired angle.  You should use at least a 5 to 1, greater if possible) for the angle.

To make this process a lot easier I drafted a simple wing plan using autocad to build on.  The drawing includes the wing spar, drag spar, subleading edge, trailing edge, as well as the location of each rib.  While this is not the only way to do this, it does beat drawing a plan by hand or measuring as you go.  By printing out the wing plan full size I will have a blue print to build on, which makes building a straight wing much easier.Note: Wing twist is achieved by mounting the ribs onto the spar at the desired angle, the spar cap does not twist at all.Lay out the wing drawing, making sure if you printed it in segments as I did that they are all properly aligned and that the spacing is correct.   Lay the top spar cap upside down on the drawing using spacers to support it along its length and especially at the center.   Now transfer the horizontal line from the rib templates to the leading edge of the ribs.  This is to allow you to build the wing with the desired amount of twist.   Apply woodglue to the spar notch of the outermost rib.  Then using the trailing edge and the mark on the leading edge mark align the rib so that the mark and the trailing edge are the same height above the working surface.  In my case this alignment would give me the 2 degrees of washout that I desired.  Once the elevation of the rib is set insure that it is square with the surface of the table, and that it is mounted in line with the ribs on the wing plan.Repeat for the other side of the wing   Apply the inner most non reinforced rib similarly to how the outermost rib was installed.   Repeat for the other side of the wingBy gluing these two ribs on each wing it is now possible to align the ribs angle of twist without the need to measure the height off of the table.  TThis is done by applying wood glue to the spar notch of the rib and then setting the rib square to the table with a triangle.     Then verify that the rib is lined up with the wing plan.     Now that the ribs is in position move to the end of the wing and look down the wing in such a was that the trailing edge of the wing tip is aligned withe the trailing edge of the root rib.     Now adjust the rib that you are positioning so the its trailing edge is also aligned between these two ribs.     This is an iterative process so check to verify that the rib is still square with the table, then aligned with the wing plan, and aligned between the root and tip trailing edge.     Once the alignment is perfect allow the wood glue to set up.  Although this may seem like a tedious process it goes rather quickly since while one rib is setting up you can do a rib on the other side of the wing", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FDU/0BN0/HZJOC7U7/FDU0BN0HZJOC7U7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCS/ZS3A/HZDYGDCZ/FCSZS3AHZDYGDCZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9Z/M8FX/HZJOCKN2/F9ZM8FXHZJOCKN2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTY/H4ZW/HZDYGDJC/FTYH4ZWHZDYGDJC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHL/AVFD/HZDYGTFA/FHLAVFDHZDYGTFA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWR/N68E/HZDYGDJR/FWRN68EHZDYGDJR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5Q/ZDAE/HZDYGDKJ/F5QZDAEHZDYGDKJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1W/RNJY/HZDYGDL6/F1WRNJYHZDYGDL6.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 25: Wing Fabrication: Attaching Non Structural Ribs"}, {"step": 26, "steps_text": "Since the structural wing ribs on this airplane are a composite laminate of materials, wood glue would be a very ineffective way to attach them to the spar. This is because wood glue is a water based adhesive and would not be able to penetrate the resin to form a secure mechanical bond. Therefore different adhesives had to be used to attach them.  Here I will describe how the center wing ribs were attached and then how the landing gear ribs were fitted to the wing.Verify the fit of the wing ribs on the spar, these ones can be difficult to fit since the material is so hard.   Once the proper fit is achieved put on gloves and ensure that you have sufficient ventilation.Mix a small batch of 5 minute epoxy.  Only a few drops will be needed for each spar notch.Apply a small amount of epoxy to the center wing rib and align it on the spar as done previously.The remainder of the structural ribs can be done at this point with the exception of the landing gear ribs.The landing gear ribs must be fitted to ensure that they operate correctly on the airplane.  In my case since the landing gear were retracting towards the center of the wing I had to remove material from the inner ribs to allow the landing gear to retract.  I recommend waiting until this stage to do this because with the wing starting to come together it is possible to see if the landing gear must be angled inside of the wing.  In my case it had to be because the wing had dihedral and my landing gear extends a full 90 degrees, therefore if they were not they would be bent outwards when extended. To do this I retracted the landing gear and repeated trying laying it into the slot that I was cutting until there was sufficient room for it to retract with a about 1/16\" of an inch surrounding the landing struct.  This was done to ensure that if the gear was damaged or moved during flight it would still be able to open or close.

The lower spar cap is installed as two separate pieces and is joined in the wing unlike the upper spar cap that was was installed as one piece.  Below is how to install and join the two halves of the lower spar cap.Make sure that the wing is still being well supported and is not sagging in the center or along the span, if so add a few more supports under the wing.  Improper alignment will result in undesired wing twist.     Test fit one half of the spar cap. Note that I am leaving enough overhang of this spar cap over the center of the wing to attach the other half of the spar to. Things to look for include very tight ribs,very loose ribs, and that the spar cap is fully enclosed by the spar slot in the rib. It cannot be allowed to stick above the ribs otherwise it will show through the wing sheeting.Adjust the fit of the lower spar cap by carefully removing material or by adding in shimming material to the ribs until it is a perfect fit.     The most challenging part of installing the spar cap is that since it is rigid it must be glued in all of the slots at one time.  With that many joints its is impossible to hold and support all of them at one time by yourself.  Therefore creative means had to be found to hold it in place as the glue set.  To do this I positioned pieces of electrical tape and masking tape underneath the wing that were long enough to wrap up and around the top spar cap to firmly secure them in place while the glue set.     All of the non structural wing ribs should be glued to the upper spar cap with wood glue while the center ribs and landing gear ribs must be glued in with epoxy.  While doing this I recommend using a paint brush to paint the wood glue into the spar notches and then mix the 5 minute epoxy and apply it to the reinforced ribs, since the wood glue will take longer to set.     Once glue has been applied to all of the joints insert the spar cap.  Then secure it in place with the tape, and wait for the glue to dry.Begin test fitting the other side of the spar cap, in addition to checking and fixing its fit with the wing ribs. It is vital that the joint between the two halves of the spar cap is made to fit as closely as possible because as with the upper spar cap the center of the lower spar will be heavily loaded during flight operations.    Once satisfied with the fit prepare to glue the spar cap in by placing the tape at the desired locations    Apply the glue as before, for the connection between the two halves of the spar cap at the center of the wing use epoxy and once the rest of the tape is applied, hold or clamp this this joint until it has set.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZP/QUZT/HZDYGV29/FZPQUZTHZDYGV29.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F13/XGVG/HZDYGV3T/F13XGVGHZDYGV3T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRO/CAK9/HZDYGV4I/FROCAK9HZDYGV4I.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEU/9EI5/HZDYGV6L/FEU9EI5HZDYGV6L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLO/BCV3/HZDYGV76/FLOBCV3HZDYGV76.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGY/DXUB/HZDYGV7R/FGYDXUBHZDYGV7R.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F60/AM5X/HZDYH4VR/F60AM5XHZDYH4VR.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 27: Wing Fabrication: Lower Spar Cap"}, {"step": 28, "steps_text": "The sub leading edge is a 1/4\" think piece of balsa that is attached to front of the ribs.  Its purpose is to be something for the sheeting to be attached to since sheeting would not be able to make the curve around the leading edge of the wing.  It also provided the required thickness to allow the leading edge of the wing to be sanded to the shape of the airfoil. Sand the tips of the ribs very gently with a bar sander such that they all have the same angle and are perfectly straight in respect to one another.   Next cut out an over sided strip of 1/4\" balsa from a sheet.  To make cutting a long strip of any material easier with a razor simply put double sided tape on the back of the straight edge and it will make the task incredibly easy since the edge will not move while cutting.  Also do not try to cut through the material in one pass, because it increases the chances of splitting the wood. Instead make a few light passes to cut the whole way through.   Use thick CA to glue the sub leading edge to the ribs.  I found it is easiest to apply the glue to the end rib and then align the strip with the center rib. Once the glue has dried then apply glue to the next few ribs. Be careful to not bend the ribs that the sub leading edge is glued to while gluing it to new ribs.   Work gluing sets of ribs until one side of the wing is covered.Align a straight edge along the side of the wing that does not yet have the sub leading edge attached, then trace its path on to the leading edge that is attached.Cut off and then sand the excess sub leading edge until it matches the path of the other wings leading edge.Glue the sub leading edge onto the other wing as previously done.Make sure it's centered as shown in the photos.Now that the sub leading edge is attached, begin carving (using a razor or a razor plane) it closer to match the contour of the upper and lower wing surfaces.  It should not become rounded in the front, rather it should look like a trapezoid.Once the sub leading edge is close to the shape of the upper and lower surface you must prep the wing for sanding.  Apply a piece of duct tape along the ribs that it will be sanded in front of.  This will protect the ribs and serve as a guide for sanding.   Using a sanding bar sand the sub leading edge to match the contours, being very gentle and paying special attention to the sound it makes as it sands.  Chatter indicates that a rib may not be attached, you will also here a different sound when you begin sanding the tape.

To add to the challenge the shear web was installed on the leading edge of the wing, this had its own pros and cons.  While it did produce a smooth surface for the landing gear to ride on if the alignment is off, it also reduced the size of the already small space it was being installed in.  Furthermore I had mis-measured the space required for my landing gear so I had to adjust the size of the landing gear cross members that connected the landing gear to the ribs.Set the landing gear inside of the gear rails to see which ribs need to be hallowed out to allow the wheels to retract fully.      Cut the required ribs so that the wheels are able to fully retract into the wing. Now determine the angle the landing gear will be mounted at.The gear can be mounted so that if looked down upon looks like it is slanted toward the front or back of the wing. However doing this will require the angle of the wheel to be adjusted or else the wheels will either point inwards or outwards when extended.     Once the correct position is found mark one of the mounting holes and drill using the appropriate drill bit being careful to support the end of the wings so that the end ribs are not crushed.Place a bolt through through the landing gear into the drilled hole and then drill the remaining holes using the gear as the guide.Now that all of the landing gear bolt holes are drilled the landing gear must be shimmed such that is parallel to the ground and thus perpendicular to the ground when extended.  This is critical since mounting the landing gear so that it is angled in or out increase the stress on the gear when landing and thus the chances of the gear collapsing.Using a piece of basswood carve it down into a wedge to and then sand it until it is the perfect angle to mount the gear straight.     Once the angle is correct use thick CA to glue the wedge in place.     Flip the wing upside and drill through the back side of the mounting holes to put a hole through the wedge.Bolt the landing gear into the landing gear bracket.  On the back side attach the gear with a washer and a nylon lock nut to ensure that the nut never comes off since it would be very difficult to replace and also could get stuck in the landing gear mechanism.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FIO/HBSM/HZDYIABH/FIOHBSMHZDYIABH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFH/LYR8/HZDYIAGG/FFHLYR8HZDYIAGG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOR/OH15/HZDYIAGO/FOROH15HZDYIAGO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA4/UZ95/HZDYIALN/FA4UZ95HZDYIALN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIX/G2P9/HZDYIAUS/FIXG2P9HZDYIAUS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG5/T6K2/HZDYIB3X/FG5T6K2HZDYIB3X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9Z/US9T/HZDYIBZA/F9ZUS9THZDYIBZA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7E/L8XC/HZDYIC1G/F7EL8XCHZDYIC1G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7B/9PBA/HZDYIBZO/F7B9PBAHZDYIBZO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJW/2235/HZDYIC0Y/FJW2235HZDYIC0Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR9/MG6D/HZDYIABA/FR9MG6DHZDYIABA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FK5/XRNU/HZDYIC2O/FK5XRNUHZDYIC2O.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 30: Wing Fabrication: Landing Installation"}, {"step": 31, "steps_text": "To build the ailerons it is easiest to build them while the end of the ribs which will be used to make them are still attached to the wing.  The flaps are not being constructed this way since the ribs in that section of the wing are the reinforced ribs that were made for the landing gear.  The flaps will be constructed later on.  Once the ailerons are constructed the trailing edge will be installed on the rear of the ribs.  Lastly the hinge fairing is installed on the upper rear trailing edge.Square the wing off on the wing spar in such a way that it will stay.    Measure from the leading edge back to where the trailing edge/ flaps will begin and mark it on the tip rib and the innermost rib on the flap.    Place a ruler between the marks and then mark all of the ribs, additionally make the location of the center of the radius being made for the hinge.Now use a square to mark the trailing edge of all of the ribs from the bottom to the top, and the mark for the radius of the hinges.Cut off of the trailing edges off of the ribs that will not be part of the ailerons or the root section.Sand the the beginning of the ailerons so that they will fit tightly in the fairings, look at the photos for an example of what this may look at.  Note that the sanding continued passed the hinge center point to make covering easier    Using thick CA glue the 1/32\" balsa sheeting to the aileron ribs. This will make it sanding the other side of the ailerons easier since they will no longer move while sanding.Now that the ailerons are secure sand the other side of them to thin then down to fit the fairing that will be installed later.Sand the trailing edge of the 1/32\" sheeting on the side of the aileron that is covered down to a point from the end of the ribs to the trailing edge of the aileron sheeting.Using thick CA glue along the wing ribs to install the other side of the aileron sheeting.Cut along the line that makes the end of the wing to separate the aileron from the wing.Once the ailerons are separated from the wing drop thin CA into the aileron skin to glue the trailing edge together. Be careful to not add to much or else it will seep through the skin.With the ailerons and trailing edges of the ribs removed from the wing carefully sand the end of the ribs until they are all aligned.Attach the over sized drag spar made from a strip of 1/16\" thick balsa to the trailing edge of the wing using thick CA.Use tape to protect the ribs as done on the leading edge to sand the drag spar down to size.Determine the size of the hinge fairing that fits the hinge that is being installed.Glue on a the hinge fairing using thick CA and again sand it flush with the ribs.Position a ruler between the drag spar segments on each wing and mark all of the center ribs, this is where the central drag spar will be installed.  It provides the structure required to mount the fuselage to the wing.Cut the spar notches out of the ribs using a razor saw, by making multiple cuts down and then breaking away the material in between them, the closer the cuts the easier that this will be.  Also ensure that the entire drag spar is inside of the ribs.  This may require the out board ribs to be just slightly deeper because of the dihedral.Once the spar is properly dry fitted mix 5 min epoxy to use on the reinforced ribs and apply wood glue to any non reinforced ribs to secure the central drag spar.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F6Q/5C5A/HZEWPHER/F6Q5C5AHZEWPHER.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F68/M8F7/HZEWPH0P/F68M8F7HZEWPH0P.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXA/5YD2/HZFDTZFY/FXA5YD2HZFDTZFY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPO/NOH9/HZFDTZIA/FPONOH9HZFDTZIA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2Z/KYA9/HZFDTZJM/F2ZKYA9HZFDTZJM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9D/MBJ2/HZEWPHL0/F9DMBJ2HZEWPHL0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F08/HAXV/HZFDTZPQ/F08HAXVHZFDTZPQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDK/IG2B/HZFDTZK9/FDKIG2BHZFDTZK9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDJ/HMNR/HZEWPHM4/FDJHMNRHZEWPHM4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3G/AGUW/HZEWPHN5/F3GAGUWHZEWPHN5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9J/B4G8/HZEWPHNI/F9JB4G8HZEWPHNI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSN/DXD8/HZEWPHO7/FSNDXD8HZEWPHO7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCK/R9ZS/HZEWPHPC/FCKR9ZSHZEWPHPC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXS/S4S2/HZEWPHPW/FXSS4S2HZEWPHPW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYG/A7JU/HZEWPHQD/FYGA7JUHZEWPHQD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMQ/8JAD/HZEWPHQR/FMQ8JADHZEWPHQR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV9/XZ42/HZFDU9Y8/FV9XZ42HZFDU9Y8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNW/PLN7/HZFDUA4Q/FNWPLN7HZFDUA4Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6V/3SKP/HZFDUA72/F6V3SKPHZFDUA72.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 31: Wing Fabrication: Drag Spar and Aileron Construction"}, {"step": 32, "steps_text": "All sheeted surfaces on this model are covered in 1/32\" thick balsa wood.  Since I am leaving the wood grain exposed when the model is finished it is important to match the grain and color of the board to the piece next to it.  Furthermore it is important to make the seams as smooth tight as possible because wood filler will show up after finishing.Select the sheets of balsa that will be joined on the edge.  Important considerations are the curve in the edge since no boards are actually cut straight, the wood grain, wood color, and hardness.    If the two board needing to be joined have edges that do not perfectly match because the edges are not straight or are wavy use a long bar sander to very carefully sand them to fit each other, while maintaining a square edge on the sheets.    Lay down a sheet of wax paper and tape it down to the work surface    Lay a piece of packaging tape on the wax paper.  This is to prevent the glue joint from sticking because CA will glue to wax paper.Lay the boards being glued face down on the the working surface with the edge being joined over the packing tape.Put on a pair of gloves and ensure there is adequate ventilation.Apply a thin bead of thick CA on the first 8 to 10 inches of the joint and hold the pieces together being sure to keep them flat on the table.Two alternate methods can be used at this point.      The first option is to bend the remaining portion of the sheeting back and apply another bead of thick CA approximately the same distance and align.    Hold the boards flat on the table and hold the seam together.  Then apply a few drops of thin CA to the section being held.  Be careful to not apply too much or else it will soak into the surrounding wood.Repeat this as needed until enough strips have been jointed together to cover one side of the the wing surface.Sand the sheet with a sanding block with between 120 and 180 grit sand paper on it to level out the surface where the joints are and to remove excess glue.  Patience is needed while sanding or else the sheet can shatter.    Determine how to position the grain of the wood on the wing.  The wood will only be able to bend perpendicular to the grain.  In my case I ran the grain along the leading edge, this will leave the center of the wing with a V where the grains of the wood come together, however since this will not be seen I can accept this.Lay the balsa sheet over the wing and with a pencil mark where excess can be cut away with a sharp razor to make the sheet more manageable.  Leave at least an inch of excess around the edges.    Lay the sheeting over the wing slightly ahead of the leading edge. Apply a line of Thick CA along the top of the sub leading edge and then carefully move the sheeting over the leading edge and work from the center out applying pressure to adhere it.  Be careful not to \"pull\" or \"push\" the wood or else the sheeting my become wavy further back on the wing.Gently lift the sheeting up being carefully to not bend it to far and crack it.  Then apply a bead of Thick CA to the the front half of the rib in front of the spar. Next fold the sheeting back over the glue making sure that it adheres smoothly without wrinkles.Repeat the previous step now going up to the wing spar.At this point you can proceed two ways.Keep lifting and applying thick CA to the ribs until you finish the wing.Flip the wing over and while supporting the skin from underneath use small drops of thin CA along the joints to glue the sheeting on.Trim away any excess wood from the edges with a sharp razor.Sand the sheeting at the center rib at an angle to allow a scarf joint to be made along it.Fit the other wings sheeting and trim off the extra.Continue dry fitting until the edge of the new sheet comes to end of the scarf joint on the sheet on the other wing.   Place the root end of the sheeting on the edge of a table and sand in the scarf joint to match the one on the wing.Apply the sheeting to the second half of the wing using the same technique used on the first half.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FG3/VZJY/HZFDWAC7/FG3VZJYHZFDWAC7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMD/LGYS/HZFDWAD1/FMDLGYSHZFDWAD1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEW/H5TQ/HZFDWAE2/FEWH5TQHZFDWAE2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXF/4408/HZFDWAEX/FXF4408HZFDWAEX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGJ/XIMQ/HZFDWAP5/FGJXIMQHZFDWAP5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIR/4JB8/HZFDWAH9/FIR4JB8HZFDWAH9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5D/ZCOI/HZFDWBBN/F5DZCOIHZFDWBBN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS3/Z6FQ/HZFDWAFS/FS3Z6FQHZFDWAFS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVL/LZPF/HZFDW9AP/FVLLZPFHZFDW9AP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYJ/9B9C/HZFDW9P0/FYJ9B9CHZFDW9P0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS5/1FF3/HZFDWBAD/FS51FF3HZFDWBAD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM2/J1IA/HZFDWA3U/FM2J1IAHZFDWA3U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F83/G4KA/HZFDWA4L/F83G4KAHZFDWA4L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXY/1JJH/HZFDWHPU/FXY1JJHHZFDWHPU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFX/WJHB/HZFDWHQY/FFXWJHBHZFDWHQY.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 32: Wing Fabrication: Sheeting the Upper Wing Surface"}, {"step": 33, "steps_text": "Now that the shells of the ailerons are completed, the control linkages and hinges must be build into the aileron and into the wing.  Since I have choosen to use the rotatory drive system to move the control surface the ailerons will not have any visible control horns but instead will have a slot in side of them where a bent wire will rotate to move the control surface.  In this step I will describe how I made the slots, installed the hinge pockets and hinges, as well as how the leading edge was installed on the ailerons.  Additional information on rotatory drive systems can be found at the link below.http://augiemckibben.tripod.com/g2_instructions.htmlThe rotatory drive system that I purchased did not include a set of pockets so they had to be fabricated.  First i cut 6 sheets of 2oz fiberglass large enough to make make pockets for all of my control surfaces from.    To prepare for the wet layup tape a waxed sheet to the working surface.    Mix the epoxy and work it into the the first ply of fiberglass, once it is thoroughly wetted place it on the waxed sheet.Wet the next sheet of fiberglass and after squeegeeing out the excess epoxy place it onto the previously placed fiberglass ply.  Then squeegee the plys together to remove any air bubbles. Repeat this until all of the plys are stacked together.Place a waxed sheet on the top side of the laminate stack and squeegee out any air bubbles to ensure that a flat smooth surfaces is created.Wait for the resin to cure.Using a razor saw strips out of the fiberglass plate approximately 3/4\" of an inch wide.  These will form the inner surfaces of the pocket that the drive shaft will rotate in.The pockets need to be large enough to allow the drive shaft to rotated freely within therefore I made mine 2.5\" long.  Again I cut the fiberglass with a razor saw.While wearing the appropriate protective equipment rough up what will be the outside of the pocket and also the outside 1/4\" inch on the inner surface, this will allow the fiberglass to be glued while keeping a smooth inner pocket.Glue a 1/16\" thick basswood backer to the back of the fiber glass liners.    Now the gap must be set between the two plates I used a piece of 1/4x1/8\" bass wood to make the spacer for the drive shaft.  First glue the spacers onto the inside of once of the fiberglass spacers with thick CA.Sand the spacers and then place the other pocket halve on the spacers and check the fit with the driveshaft.  The fit should be tight, but not to tight as to where it does not rotate freely and smoothly.Once the desired fit is achieved glue the top piece of fiberglass onto the lower assembly to make the pocket.Glue thin strip of balsa onto each side of the pocket till it is the thickness of the opening in the aileron.  Then sand the balsa until the pocket fits perfectly in the aileron, but also importantly the pocket must align with the hinge line in the center of the control surface.Once the desired fit is achieved for the pocket assembly install it into the aileron with wood glue.The hinge pockets are made from a 3/8x3/8\" rod of balsa with a hold drilled length wise into the rod.Then a notch is cut in the top side of the hole so that the set screw can be installed.Dry fit the hinges until they fit well into the pocket and are centered.Glue in the hinge pockets and then the hinge block into the aileron.Mark the upper and lower surface where the hinge is located so that once the leading edge is attached, it will be easy to locate the hinge.The leading edge is made from an over sided piece of 1/4\" thick balsa, use thick CA to glue it onto the aileron being careful to not twist the aileron.

The main differences are that the servo is set up to use a control horn and push rod setup rather than a rotary drive system,  this was done because the elevator is equipped with a standard size servo for increased reliability and control authority.  Additionally the elevator is solid rather than being build up as all of the other control surfaces were, this was done because there elevator is very thin at the tips and the difficulties in building a build up elevator that would be strong enough is not worth the weight savings. Using the same technique used to make the wing rib templates draft the horizontal stabilizer rib templates (NACA0010)Print out and use double sided tape to attach the templates to the 1/16\" inch balsa stock     Cut out the ribs and then sand to the final shape.     Cut the spar notches.Draw the blue print to build on and then cover with wax paper.Cut the elevator spar made from 3/16x1/8 basswood to length, note that this spar is 4 pieces and that they will come together in a V. Then place the stabilizers spar on the blue prints being sure to prop the tip up so that the center of the stabilizer is horizontal.Glue on the ribs, while verifying that ribs are square with the table.  Do not install the center rib at this time.     Once the ribs are all installed dry fit the other spar half making sure it will not twist the elevator. Once the fit is correct glue in the other spar cap.The shear web is made from 1/16\" balsa. Cut and install it as done on the wing.The two sections must now be joined together with a structural carry though.  To accomplish this I cut and sanded three pieces of basswood that would be large enough to completely fill the gap between the upper and lower spar cap.  These pieces not only replace the shear web in this section but also serve to unify the right and left wing.     Now cut the middle rib so that it can be installed in two pieces on the spar.Sand the leading edge with a straight edge to properly angle the ribs for the installation of the sub leading edge.The sub leading edge is 1/4\" thick over sized balsa strip that can be glued on to the ribs with thick CA.Use a razor to get the sub leading edge close to following the angle of the ribs. Once the shape is close use the tape technique that was used on the wing to protect the ribs as the sub leading edge is sanded.Since the stabilizer is swept the leading edge will need to cross as done on the wing.     Mark where the elevator will begin on the ribs and then cut off the excess rib material with a razor saw.Attach the drag spar and sand as was done of the wing.Note that the structure of the elevator is made mounting points must be installed before the stabilizer is sheeted.  I chose to install two brackets. The front bracket is made to connect to the upper and lower beams on the truss in the fuselage.  The aft mounting bracket mounts only to the upper beam since the lower beam does not extend the entire length of the fuselage.  They are both made from 1/8\" thick hobby plywood.Sheet the first side of the vertical stabilizer using one of the methods used on the wing.Hinge pockets are fabricated exactly they were on the ailerons.Cover the other side of the horizontal stabilizer by slowly working your way from the leading edge back, by bending the sheeting up and applying thick CA to the ribs.The wingtips are made from solid pieces of 1/4\" balsa stacked together to be the thickness of the surface.Once the balsa pieces are stacked to form the tips, cut out the top view of the tip into them.  Trace that view onto the other tip and cut it out.    Glue the tip blanks on to the stabilizers tips.Use a razor to thin down the tips until they are close to the desired shape.Use progressively finer sand paper to finalize the shape of the tip.The elevator on this airplane is split by the fuselage, but is only articulated with one control rod.  To allow the motion to be transmitted between each side a dowel rod was added onto the solid wood elevator blank.  At this point I recommend drilling the hing holes in the elevator blank in case they do not come out well very little work will be lost.  Begin carving the elevator blank into a streamlined shape that follows the curves of the stabilizer. Once the elevator is sanded to shape the center section can be cut out so that it will clear the fuselage.  Additionally on the control horn side the balsa is cut back further to allow a piece of basswood to be installed.  This basswood is to provide a solid material that a slot can be cut into to mount the control horn into.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F4A/NMA3/HZGTDKCV/F4ANMA3HZGTDKCV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRF/MTTE/HZGTDKDW/FRFMTTEHZGTDKDW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNG/ENOO/HZGTDKF5/FNGENOOHZGTDKF5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4H/VUCN/HZGTDKFS/F4HVUCNHZGTDKFS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR5/J51V/HZGTDKGR/FR5J51VHZGTDKGR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJX/I74T/HZGTDKHI/FJXI74THZGTDKHI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBM/IEQR/HZGTDKIJ/FBMIEQRHZGTDKIJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOP/Z08W/HZGTDKJC/FOPZ08WHZGTDKJC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFF/VSUV/HZGTDKBO/FFFVSUVHZGTDKBO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS2/1JEN/HZGTDKC1/FS21JENHZGTDKC1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR2/UCYD/HZGTDKCG/FR2UCYDHZGTDKCG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW6/PPUJ/HZGTDKOG/FW6PPUJHZGTDKOG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFM/FAIX/HZGTDKP5/FFMFAIXHZGTDKP5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQW/QXO2/HZGTDKQ3/FQWQXO2HZGTDKQ3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI6/8KWR/HZGTDKSJ/FI68KWRHZGTDKSJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSE/804K/HZGTDKTW/FSE804KHZGTDKTW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY9/U30Q/HZGTDKUH/FY9U30QHZGTDKUH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJP/33WE/HZGTDKV8/FJP33WEHZGTDKV8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ7/MCNF/HZGTDKW4/FJ7MCNFHZGTDKW4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSF/4DWB/HZGTDKL5/FSF4DWBHZGTDKL5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRU/IDGZ/HZGTESVC/FRUIDGZHZGTESVC.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 37: Horizontal Stabilizor & Elevator Fabrication"}, {"step": 38, "steps_text": "This fuselage is designed to carry flight loads through a truss, like a bridge. Therefore most formers are not designed to take any load. The formers are simply attached to the truss to allow a streamlined fuselage to be build over the truss.The fuselage had been preliminary designed in CAD as a side view.  From this I had to determine the cross-sectional shape at each location along the fuselage.  To do this I printed out the side view from CAD and then taped it onto a sheet of foam core.  Then using poster board I began cutting out every other cross section, from there I cut out the intermediate cross sections.   Then I was able to use the model to size the fuselage truss. I was able to do this by laying a ruler along the length of the fuselage and using that to determine the height of the truss, then I measure what the maximum width of truss could be to fit inside on both ends.  By dividing the difference in size by the number of formers that were between the end points I was able to check to see if the truss would fit in the remaining formers.  You can see the final truss design marked out on the fuselage cross sections as boxes.  It is a two part truss with the joint near the middle of the cockpit.  This allowed me to maximize the size of the truss and thus strength, while also minimizing the number of joints between truss sections.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQU/ARDE/HZGTATCU/FQUARDEHZGTATCU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F46/976V/HZGTASHU/F46976VHZGTASHU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL5/L1F8/HZGTASF2/FL5L1F8HZGTASF2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSR/AHH9/HZGTAV3T/FSRAHH9HZGTAV3T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2R/CFWV/HZGTAV7P/F2RCFWVHZGTAV7P.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9O/5S54/HZGTAUZ0/F9O5S54HZGTAUZ0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ0/KB43/HZGTAV9I/FZ0KB43HZGTAV9I.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS5/F1H9/HZGTAUYN/FS5F1H9HZGTAUYN.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 38: Fuselage Design"}, {"step": 39, "steps_text": "Building the structure of the fuselage as a truss proved to be a rather fast and easy process, that produced a light yet very strong framework.  To save time constructing it I had purchased strips of  1/2x1/16x36\" hard balsa to make the corners out of, however it was challenging to find enough straight pieces.  The vertical members of the truss were made from strips of hard 1/4x1/16\" balsa, while the diagonal members were the same size but made from a lighter and softer balsa.Lay down wax paper over the working surface and apply a strip of packaging tape along the length of it to protect it from glue. Use double sided tape to stick a long straight edge to the wax paper.  This will be used as a guide while gluing the two pieces together into the beam. Stand one strip of balsa upright in front of the straight edge and then lay down the second piece flat on the table to hold the other piece in place. Hold the two pieces tightly together and with the joint over the tape.  Work from one end to the other applying thin CA to the joint to bond the two pieces together.  I have tried making beams like this previously with wood glue and have found it to be a headache because the water in the glue will swell the wood along the joint which will bend the beam.  From there it is luck as to whether it will return to being straight once both the wood and then glue have dried thoroughly.    To make assembling symmetric trusses easier, I drew a quick side view of the truss in Autocad which showed the location and spacing of the truss members when looked at from the side.  Note that you will need a different drawing for each side since they are mirror and not a copy of each other.    With the drawing printed out and taped on the working surface and covered in wax paper, apply double sided tape to hold the long corner members of the truss in place.    Start installing the vertical members, which are made from the harder balsa, following the template.     Once all the vertical members are installed then install the diagonal members.  The easiest way I have found is to sand one end of the strip into the required shape so it fits in the first corner by the vertical member and then line the strip up to pass through the opposite corner. Then cut it diagonally across with a razor saw and sand to fit the second corner.    Now that the sides of the truss are formed they must be joined.  to prepare for this I drew a very simple blue print on poster board that shows the correct taper to mount the trusses at.    Carefully align the trusses with the blue prints, and again double sided tape can be used to help hold them in place.Starting from the bottom install the horizontal members between the vertical members on the side and then install the diagonal members.Once the bottom is finished, flip the part over and do the horizontal members.  Once a sufficient number are in place the truss can be moved into a more convenient position to fit the diagonal members.  Do not forget to leave areas to allow access into the fuselage for batteries and electronics.To join the truss sections together I first tacked them together with CA, then installed a balsa doubler inside the truss at the joint between the sections.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWW/1Z8B/HZGTCGRE/FWW1Z8BHZGTCGRE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6Y/3O7N/HZGTCGRV/F6Y3O7NHZGTCGRV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDG/DEH6/HZGTCGSI/FDGDEH6HZGTCGSI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH9/XKJX/HZGTCGSZ/FH9XKJXHZGTCGSZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX6/SDFH/HZGTCGTC/FX6SDFHHZGTCGTC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ7/26Y5/HZGTCGU8/FQ726Y5HZGTCGU8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCU/5UM6/HZGTDGXV/FCU5UM6HZGTDGXV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOD/H8JD/HZGTDGYP/FODH8JDHZGTDGYP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUC/6Z4K/HZGTDGYC/FUC6Z4KHZGTDGYC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX7/4PR7/HZGTCGWL/FX74PR7HZGTCGWL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU4/JCUF/HZGTCGVT/FU4JCUFHZGTCGVT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F50/FTKO/HZGTCGXT/F50FTKOHZGTCGXT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1J/1YEH/HZGTCGYI/F1J1YEHHZGTCGYI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPC/9TRN/HZGTCGZ7/FPC9TRNHZGTCGZ7.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 39: Fuselage Fabrication: Building the Truss"}, {"step": 40, "steps_text": "The formers are basically the ribs of the fuselage, they provide the base shape to attach the balsa sheeting too.  They are all made from 1/16\" balsa, with the exception of a few structural ribs that are made from 1/8\" plywood.  Two of these structural formers are located at back of the canopy for the rear wing mount, the other two are located in front of the wing mount where the fuselage is connected on both sides in between the canopy cover and the engine cover.  The firewall is a fiberglass reinforced plywood that the motor mounts onto.  It must be extremely stiff or else vibrations from the motor can cause it to flex which will cause the vibrations to grow until either something breaks or the throttle is reduced. Additionally the firewall must be attached very well to the fuselage truss so that it can pull the airplane through the air as well as withstand any vibrations.Using the templates made from the plan cut out all of the formers out of the desired material.  The balsa formers are made in two halves and then glued together while the plywood ones are cut out as one piece.  Dry fit all of the formers to ensure they fit the truss well since the marks on the template are really just an approximation of the parts that were actually made.  Once all of the formers fit appropriately begin by installing the solid plywood formers from the widest point on the fuselage to the narrowest using wood glue.Install the remaining formers to the fuselage one half at a time.  A drop of thin CA can be used to join the two halves together in the center.  Note: because of the orientation of the grain in these pieces they can be very fragile.  If any break during the build they can simply be glued back together with CA since they are not carring any load and are hidden.The firewall is made from a fiberglass reinforced plywood that is made from 8 layers or 1/32\" basswood with a 2oz ply of fiberglass in between each layer of wood. This is made by wetting the bass wood and the fiberglass and then applying the glass to the wood just as was done on the reinforced ribs.  Ensure that this piece receives adequate  compression to ensure there are not voids in the layers once cured.  Using the appropriate safety measures cut the firewall to shape using a coping saw, leave a little excess along the inside of the cut too allow the part to be sanded  Now find the center of the firewall and mark it.  Then use that to help position the motor mounting plate.  These markings can be seem on the first picture of the fuselage with the firewall mounted, sorry I missed getting a picture of it before it was installed.  Once the position is found drill the holes for the mounting screws.  An additionally hole may need to be drilled depending if the motor has a drive shaft extending out the base of the motor.  The fuselage must be prepared to accept the firewall.  To do this I squared the front of the truss by standing the fuselage on a perfectly flat table.  I then suspended a make shift plumb bob from the center of the tail pylon.  By carefully sanding the fuselage trusses I was able to get it to align to the center of the fuselage, which would make the firewall square to the flight path (0 degrees right thrust) as desired.  The top section of the fuselage truss is flat in respect with to the direction of flight, therefore once this was trimmed to be perpendicular to the table the firewall could be set with 0 degrees of down thrust.  Adjustments to the thrust angle will be made as required by flight testing.Note: The thrust line is conventionally measured in degrees right from the center line and degrees down from center line.   The right thrust offset is to counter the torques being generated on the vertical stabilizer from the propwash, commonly known as P-Factor. Down thrust is include to reduce the airplanes tendency to climb as the throttle is increase.Rough up the back of the firewall so that it can be glued to, then tack the firewall to the fuselage using thick CA.   Reinforce the front of the fuselage by gluing in a second set of lower truss beams.  They can be seen since they produce a gap between the outer and inner truss beams. These are to increase the rigidity of the nose of the airplane.  Continue reinforcing the fuselage by gluing a 1/16\" thick piece of basswood to the top of the truss at both the engine cover and at the canopy.  Note that the excess former material was removed from the engine cover to allow a door to be placed there.  The new edges of these formers were connected with a strip of 1/16\" balsa.  These reinforcements both help strengthen the structure but also help to protect the truss while the airplane is being worked on and readied for flight.Mount the firewall to the reinforce fuselage, for this I used 1/8x1\" strips of bass wood to go around the entire perimeter of the fuselage.  These are glued to the fuselage and to the firewall with 5 minute epoxy to create a very strong bond.The truss is a very strong and light structure all together, but if a large load is applied to a single point it will break.  Such loads are not actually generated in flight but by people just touching the airplane to work inside it perhaps to install a battery, therefore from the firewall back to one former behind the canopy need to be reinforced.  To protect the truss from this 1/32\" balsa sheeting was applied to the inside of the truss.  The floor was reinforced with a sheet of 1/16\" balsa since it will have to support the battery and the weight of any of the other components and distribute it across the structure.  Hindsight being 20-20 shows that these really should have been installed when the truss was made and was in pieces.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FL1/P4GZ/HZI8Q6WA/FL1P4GZHZI8Q6WA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6Y/9CQ9/HZI8Q7EY/F6Y9CQ9HZI8Q7EY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBB/D21Q/HZI8Q7JD/FBBD21QHZI8Q7JD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNP/NHI8/HZI8Q7NR/FNPNHI8HZI8Q7NR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAU/PKQ6/HZI8Q7S5/FAUPKQ6HZI8Q7S5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHV/RXJT/HZI8QR8K/FHVRXJTHZI8QR8K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG4/RME0/HZI8QYX9/FG4RME0HZI8QYX9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR4/Q40T/HZI8QYXP/FR4Q40THZI8QYXP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF4/39MA/HZI8QZ02/FF439MAHZI8QZ02.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS6/QF8Z/HZI8QZ47/FS6QF8ZHZI8QZ47.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8G/Z20M/HZI8QZ4H/F8GZ20MHZI8QZ4H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN5/ITKS/HZI8QZ6N/FN5ITKSHZI8QZ6N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKM/5UX2/HZI8QZCK/FKM5UX2HZI8QZCK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAZ/SBMR/HZI8QZGL/FAZSBMRHZI8QZGL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQO/1B4F/HZI8QZH3/FQO1B4FHZI8QZH3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9S/1PQT/HZI8QZOP/F9S1PQTHZI8QZOP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBC/NH0E/HZI8QZR0/FBCNH0EHZI8QZR0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUQ/CYXR/HZI8R12M/FUQCYXRHZI8R12M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXN/KWUK/HZI8QRKG/FXNKWUKHZI8QRKG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9X/5GTL/HZI8QREG/F9X5GTLHZI8QREG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBQ/NJ0P/HZI8RXUA/FBQNJ0PHZI8RXUA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6N/I1I5/HZI8RY6R/F6NI1I5HZI8RY6R.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 40: Fuselage Fabrication: Installing Formers and the Firewall"}, {"step": 41, "steps_text": "The wing mount for this airplane had to allow the wing to easily be removed so that airplane could be transported.  Even though the wing and fuselage will remain two separate pieces it is critical that when they are assembled for flight that there is no slop in the connection, and that the mount will support the full weight of the airplane while it maneuvers.  Therefore a three point of contact system was designed. The front of the wing mount is a rectangular peg that attaches to the center reinforced rib and to the sub leading edge.  It is made form 1/4x1/2\" basswood and is glued to the rib using epoxy.  Then gap between the two rods is filled with a piece of basswood to make a solid peg.The rear wing mount is made by drilling two holes through the center drag spar, in which a blind nut is installed.  Over the blind nut is glued a strip of basswood with a hole aligned over the bolt hole, this piece ensures the nut never moves out of place in the wing. On the upper surface of the wing a plate is then placed above these wing bolt holes.  This plate serves a a solid point of contact to prevent the wing from twisting in reference to the fuselage.The reinforced former in front of the wing has a hole cut into it to accept the peg from the wing.  It was then reinforced with basswood frame on the front side of the former to prevent cracking.  This hole must be the a tight fit for the peg or else the wing and fuselage will be able to move in flight.Once the hole is trimmed to fit the peg the location of the rear wing bolts must be found on the fuselage. To do this the airplane was placed nose down on a flat table.  Then the distance from the wingtips to the table was measured.  When the measurement from both wingtips were equal then the wing was aligned.  I used a drill bit to mark the on the underside of the fuselage where the wing bolts would go.   To secure the wing bolts into the structure of the fuselage required substantial reinforcements. First the underside of the truss was covered in 1/16\" basswood, then a second reinforced former was installed just forward of the bolt location.   Then a 1/4x1\" basswood bar was epoxied to the reinforced formed and to the truss work.

Lastly a rectangular piece of basswood was used to fill in the center section created in this lattice to provide a solid point for the wing bolt plate to be tightened against.Once again the wing was placed nose down on the table to ensure that the wing was mounted straight.

The angle of the horizontal stabilizer must be slightly nose down to ensure the stability of the airplane, otherwise it will be unflyable.  The mount must also be made as lightly as possible since it is difficult to compensate for a tail heavy airplane with out adding a lot of weight to the nose.At this point the vertical stabilizer is a self contained structure that needs to be connected into the truss that makes up the fuselage. To do this the segments of the spar that are sticking out had to be very firmly attached. I began by making preliminary holes in the upper deck of the the truss to allow the surface to be test fitted.   Then a mounting bracket had to be made to take the loads from the spar and transfer them into the balsa truss.  It is made from 1/8\" thick plywood and has lightening holes in it to reduces excess weight. By dry fitting it it is possible to mark the location of the spar holes.   Once the vertical stabilizers mounting bracket has been dry fitted it can be glued in place with wood glue.   Make and install a second mounting plate on the lower truss members to allow the vertical stabilizers spars to attach to it, as well as making a solid mounting point for the horizontal tails front bracket.Install the tail wheel support beams.  There are made from 1/8x1/4\" bass wood.  thought difficult to see they run from the front of the upper tail bracket and extend well past where the wheel will mount.The horizontal stabilizer already has mounting brackets attached directly to its spar, however they will need to be fitted to set the correct angle with respect to the wing.  This is a repetitive dry fitting process where the angle is set by sanding the rear bracket.   Once the brackets were set to the correct size position the horizontal stabilizer inside the airplane.  Then cover the tip of the vertical stabilizers spars with the lead from a pencil.  Gently side the vertical stabilizer into position keeping it the angle  it will be mounted at.  The lead will transfer on to the skin of the horizontal tail and will show the location of the holes that must be made to allow the vertical tail's spar to pass through.Repeat this process to mark and drill the hole location on the underside of the elevator.Apply finishing glass to both the horizontal and vertical stabilizers, this process will be covered in later step.Double check the angle the tail is mounted at. Glue the horizontal stabilizer in place using 5 minute epoxy, since it will produce a very strong bond while also filling any gaps that my be hard to see.    Double check the angle the tail is mounted at, and that the holes in the horizontal stabilizer still align. Glue the vertical stabilizer in place again using 5 min epoxy.Glue in a second tail gear support that comes from as far forward as possible. It will likely not be as long as the upper member since it will hit the horizontal stabilizer.I chose to install the tail wheel bracket backwards as opposed to the intended direction.  This was done to create a tighter rear of the airplane to allow it to come down smoothly into a point.  It is epoxied onto a block of basswood that connects into the tail wheel beams that extend out of the fuselage.   The rudder had to be reinforced with a strip of basswood at the bottom to be able to support the wire going into it that moves the tail wheel.  Unfortunately there was no way to capture a picture of the final bent wire since it had to be done while the tail was mounted.  However if looking at the photo of the rudder and the tail wheel bracket the wire is bent 90 degrees down just forward of the hinge line.  Then it travels down to the level of the brass tail piece where it bends 90 degrees to the right to go though a hole in the brass cap. On the other side of the brass cap it bends up 90 degrees to lock it into place, and then the excess is cut off.     The control rod for the elevator needs to be made now while there is still easy access into the fuselage.  It is made from a 4mm carbon tube with 2-56 threaded rod epoxied about 2 inches deep into the tube on either end.  This setup reduces the weight of the control rod verses a comparable metal one and is easier to set up than the plastic tube control rods.  Additionally the carbon tube is very stiff which reduces the slop in control setup with out having to add guides inside the fuselage.  The clevises are threaded on to the rod, one of which with tread lock to prevent the pushrod from being able to rotate and unscrew out of the clevis.   Build a mounting shelf as done for all the other servos in the aft section of the fuselage and epoxy the servo into place on it, being sure to line up the control arm with the control horn on the elevator.

The fuselage has contours in more than one direction at a time, and the curves are much tighter than the relatively flat surfaces that were covered on the wings.  The first rule is that edge joints are no longer an acceptable way to join sheets because they will be impossible to align and will easily brake on the tight curves being made.Add any remaining formers, for me these were in the tail  region.Us a sanding bar to very gently sand the formers.  The goal is not to change the general shape but to ensure that they all align with one another.  This step will prevent the skin from being wavy and going up and down between formers.Sheeting must be done in either smaller pieces for where there are complex curves to negotiate or in large sheets when the lines of the airplane permit it.  The key to smooth sheeting and tight joints is to dry fit again and again, and to lightly draw alignment marks on the pieces being sheeted to help align the work when gluing it.  Additionally all joints must be scarf joints with at least a 1/4\" overlap.  This overlap allows the joints to come together smoothly and also allows them to be sanded after the sheeting is in place.  If the contours are too sharp you will find that the skin will try to bubble up somewhere else. It may still be possible to cover this area however it will likely require more than one piece of covering.  For very tight corners solid balsa will need to be used, such as the very end of the lower fuselage where the elevators pushrod comes out, or the fairing from the razorback to the rudder.  When sheeting a sharp corner it is best to install a backing to glue onto, an example would be just aft of the firewall in front of the vents the sheeting comes to a \"V\" and under the sheeting is a piece of balsa sanded to a \"V\" that I could glue to for support.  Be patient and be gentle with the covering at this stage it is very easy to crack it", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FOS/OI6O/HZI8YCT0/FOSOI6OHZI8YCT0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5K/TH53/HZI8YD54/F5KTH53HZI8YD54.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F07/OIOZ/HZI8YDTH/F07OIOZHZI8YDTH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP0/4OLQ/HZI8YE7H/FP04OLQHZI8YE7H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOW/54HJ/HZI8YEO3/FOW54HJHZI8YEO3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F88/FX9P/HZI8YEWA/F88FX9PHZI8YEWA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBY/F60V/HZI8YFDO/FBYF60VHZI8YFDO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXJ/B4FC/HZI8YFXB/FXJB4FCHZI8YFXB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7T/IXH0/HZI8YGLW/F7TIXH0HZI8YGLW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F97/RAI1/HZI8YH0J/F97RAI1HZI8YH0J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX2/PEIA/HZI8YH3F/FX2PEIAHZI8YH3F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH6/4S28/HZI8YHA7/FH64S28HZI8YHA7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4I/3HHL/HZI8YHST/F4I3HHLHZI8YHST.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLF/RVG4/HZI8YICJ/FLFRVG4HZI8YICJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR5/86CA/HZI8YIPP/FR586CAHZI8YIPP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGA/5PFN/HZI8YJ6Q/FGA5PFNHZI8YJ6Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3R/8O7A/HZI8YJTT/F3R8O7AHZI8YJTT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH9/RNFR/HZI8YKLW/FH9RNFRHZI8YKLW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBK/JGW2/HZI8YLFU/FBKJGW2HZI8YLFU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 45: Fuselage Fabrication: Sheeting"}, {"step": 46, "steps_text": "The landing gear on this model is concealed by two doors when the gear is retracted.  The inner doors are articulated with a micro high torque servo  to ensure under any condition that they will open. The outer gear doors are attached to the landing gear and move with them. In order for the landing gear to function properly a landing gear sequencer must be used otherwise the inner doors would close faster than the landing gear and only bad things come after that. The sequencer allows you to set up a time delay between each stage of extending and retracting, while also allowing for flexibly in the setup of the doors.  Mine operate as follows starting from the landing gear up position.Inner door opens   Landing gear opens   Inner door closes   Inner door opens   Landing gear closes   Inner door closesThat is enough about how the gear works lets get to how to build them.Design the outer landing gear doors, they must be long enough to cover the landing gear legs but have to be short enough that when the landing gear and the soft wheel are fully compressed that the door will not strike the ground.  They should also leave sufficient margin in front of and behind the gear and if the gear somehow twists that they will not strike the wing sheeting.With the shape determined cut the door out of 1/8\" thick balsa.     Install the gear door and hinge onto the rib on the outside of the landing gear using CA.A spacer is used to prevent the gear from striking the door as it opens.  Additionally small rubber band is used to secure the gear to the landing gear strut.Next design the inner gear door, allow extra length on the door to allow it to overlap the outer gear door. Again it must provide the necessary clearance for the wheel.  Also it may be designed to use only one servo to operate both doors. (Initially I set up the landing gear to use two GWS pico servos, one for each door. However towards the end of the door fitting one of the servos had an electrical glitch and would no longer respond.  At that point I replaced the two pico servos with one high torque micro servo)   Cut the inner gear doors out of 1/8\" balsa.Install the hinges and the inner gear door.  The hinge that I used has the control horn build into it, the advantage being that it had a very small footprint, however it does require more torque than it really should to open and close the doors.   With both doors installed sand the ends of the door so that the inner door overlaps the outer door.Drill a hole through the center rib to allow a push rod to connect between the door and the servo arm.Bend the push rod, note that I included a zig-zag in the push rod,  this is to increase the flexibility of the rod and will help prevent the servo from binding, also it it allows the pushrod length to be easily adjusted.Lastly Install a neodymium magnet on the tip of the inner door, as well as underneath it.

Given that my model was about 11 inches tall (280mm), and my longest ball nose endmill was 3 inches long, I divided my model into 4 sections of roughly 2.77 inches each.Before splitting the model, I added some registering holes through the whole thing, so I could easily put the final piece back together using some support wooden dowels. I used 5 holes, 3 that go all the way through, and 2 that only go through 3/4 of my design.The diameter of the holes were selected based on the drill bits available.

The roughing path type I used is called Pocket Clearing, and it was easy to set up. A couple of important options I modified were the step-down amount, the overlapping amount, and the feeds and speeds. I set the step-down to 10mm, which is a little bit larger than 3/8\u201d, and the overlap to 10mm, which is a bit less than half of the endmill radius. Feed was 5080 mm/min and spindle speed 4000 RPM.I also set the bottom limit to be 2mm above my model\u2019s bottom plane. This was to make sure that the roughing pass didn\u2019t go all the way down to the plywood and released the pieces from the block.After roughing, I set up the drilling for the registering holes. If this was harder wood, or metal, I would have been more careful and used some kind of pecking routine. Since MDF is soft, I could drill all the way through in one pass with a slow feed rate.This was done by selecting Drilling from the top menu, and selecting the hole geometries in the model.

Most hardwood comes rough-cut from a large supplier, however, you can save yourself this step if you're willing to spend a little extra for pre-planed boards at your box stores.

Cutting this down will allow you to create your four side posts.  I measured slightly wider than what my dimensions called for again for my margin of error.  To get my four posts, I measured twice as thick as my sides had to be so I could cut it in half, then half again.  In other words, I cut the post down the middle twice - just imagine a cross on the end of the board and you'll get the idea (figures 5 through 7).  My plans called for 25mm wide supports, but I had been a bit too vigorous in my planing earlier and only had 48mm to work with (figure 1 and 2).  It isn't a big deal if your lumber is not exactly as you planned as long as you are comfortable adjusting your plans going forward.  I cut my wood down to four 24mm wide supports instead.  I made sure to use the \"ripping\" side of my Japanese pull saw (figure 3).  The ripping side is the side with chisel like teeth. The other side, \"crosscut,\" has teeth like a shark.  The ripping saw is designed to cut with the grain.I used my marking gauge to pre-mark where I wanted to saw (figure 4).  This helps you visualize where you want to saw and actually makes it easier to saw in a straight line.Again, i'm fairly new so I made mistakes in sawing, as seen in picture four.  I \"hid my crimes\" by planing out these mistakes later.  This, again, made my lumber thinner than my design but I was still able to work with it.Plane your four supports flat, level, and square with each other (figures 8 and 9).  My work surface didn't allow me to do all four at once, so I made do by planing three, then planing the last one to match.  It's not ideal but it's what I had to work with.To finish fine-tuning your support stock, square one end of your shorter posts.  Figure 10 shows me squaring using a home-made shooting board, which holds the stock at 90 degrees to my plane.  I run my plane along the end of the board and it makes it square.  After, trim your other end to slightly longer than needed with your cross cut saw.  You can use your marking knife (I used my X-Acto knife, figure 11) to mark a line across your board before you trim it with your cross cut saw (figure 12).  Marking it with a marking knife works just like a marking guage.  Next, square the other end.  I didn't bother squaring the ends of my two longer support braces because they get cut to angles in the final design.You should now have two shorter bottom supports and two longer top supports.  The bottom supports should be square on all sides, but the top supports don't need their ends square.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F0W/ZWKI/JAMTVFZZ/F0WZWKIJAMTVFZZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUR/M3O5/JAMTVG53/FURM3O5JAMTVG53.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7L/5CCR/JAMTVFSZ/F7L5CCRJAMTVFSZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1W/1M33/JAMTVGKJ/F1W1M33JAMTVGKJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCB/TT2A/JAMTVFTI/FCBTT2AJAMTVFTI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5P/2ZOP/JAMTVFWO/F5P2ZOPJAMTVFWO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE9/SKMH/JAMTVGH5/FE9SKMHJAMTVGH5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F48/TI81/JAMTVGLC/F48TI81JAMTVGLC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZR/C2JM/JAMTVGMJ/FZRC2JMJAMTVGMJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI7/2QTB/JAMTVGNV/FI72QTBJAMTVGNV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9O/OSBO/JAMTVGQY/F9OOSBOJAMTVGQY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO4/QF3T/JAMTVGVZ/FO4QF3TJAMTVGVZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Fine Tune Your Support Stock"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "I used my T-Bevel to mark my angles.

Using the tool to mark all the angles at once ensures accuracy and the angles are all the same.I measured to make sure I didn't start cutting too far back (figure 4), then I started cutting my tenon for my \"corner bridle joint\" (figure 5).  A corner bridle joint connects two ends of wood and allows for long-grain to long-grain connection, which is a strong bond with glue.I cut the \"mortise\" (negative space) on the shorter, bottom supports first (figure 6), then cut the tenons (positive space) on the upper supports (figure 7). To do this, I measured the widths of the support, divided by three and rounded to the nearest whole number.  Here, the dimension was 24mm, so the third was 8mm.  If they were 23mm thick, I would have still used 8mm to keep things simple.  I found the center of the board, then measured out each way 4mm.  This ensures the mortise and tenon is in the center of the support.  When you mark these, be sure to choose a reference face (I used the inside face) and STICK TO IT.  This will ensure your joints line up.  I had plenty of wood to trim after connecting them, but that's a happier accident than not having enough.  Glue the mortise and tenon together and you have your frame (figure 8).

My diagram called for 100mm wide boards, so I measured that out (plus a little extra for errors!) and cut those first (figure 2 and 3).  This leaves us with two 24mm by 100mm boards, so I marked a line down the middle of the thin side (24 down to 12) and started cutting.  This was a terribly long task and my Japanese pull saw kept binding (figure 5).  I got blisters from this.  I would highly suggest a true \"rip\" saw, or if it weren't a hand-tool only project, a bandsaw.

I also trimmed down the top too just a little, no need for this to be razor (figure 3).  Square an end of each board.  I marked a right angle on my boards to help me tell me I got it squared with the planer (figure 4). A helpful tool was my block plane.  The lower angle helps reduce tear-out when squaring your ends.  Measure the length you need.  From the diagram, my measurement is 725mm.  I cut down to near this line, then squared with the planer from there.  I made plenty of mistakes planing these thin boards, most notably was trying to plane against the grain.  This causes the board fibers to tear out rather than shave off.

I don't have a shooting board for this angle, so I just eyeballed it (figure 1).  Now you need to mark all your mortises on the supports.  I referenced my diagram a lot here.  The rear corner of the seat starts 10mm up from the inner corner of the bridle joint on the support (figure 2).  Then I just measured the same distance from the edge all the way up the top support, that way the seats all start the same distance inset from the edge.  My diagram called for a slight 5 degree tilt to the seat to ensure the beanies stayed in their seat, so I marked this with my T-bevel (figure 3).  Each seat starts about 100mm up the inset from the last, so I marked these at this time too.  I used my seats to mark down their exact width on the supports.  I had to decide which seat will be in what order, and I had to keep them that way, to make sure the measurement was true.  I placed the board's back bottom edge at the \"x\" on the support, aligned with the 5 degree tilt, outlined the board (figure 4).  I used my marking knife and gauge to get consistent depths.Chisel out your waste.  This step took the second longest, and was the loudest by far.

None of the (ostensibly identical) shapes are very similar, but because there are so many curves and few parallel lines, you can't easily tell. I know of course, and it drives me crazy. But done beats perfect!There are some tricks to using a jig saw that I have learned along the way: - patience is key - don't force it - if it is hard to push, you are probably bending the blade. Stop, look at the blade and the cut, back up and try again. - bent blades are the result of trying to 'push' the heel of the iron back onto your cutting line. As much as you would like it to, a jigsaw simply cannot cut sideways at all (this is a major difference to cutting with a router). You need to strike a balance between keeping the blade at ninety degrees to the curve and following your carefully marked pencil line. - good blades in a cheap machine will outperform okay blades in an expensive one. And jig saw blades are pretty cheap, so get a few of the good ones. - A good stance will make the cut straighter and cleaner - just cut it! Confidence will yield a better result. And in this project, the worst case is having to buy another sheet of cheap ply. Cutting is almost the most fun part, and marking out a second time will take much less time than the first.You need to cut:Rectangular base (this is a solid panel, and takes a lot of material)Two sidesOne front panel (split in two sections in this case, but I wouldn't suggest you do it that way)Four wingsOne rear 'arch' panelTwo 'ribs'Four nosebox panelsFront nose panelPhew!(there is more cutting later, but that will utilise the scrap)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ5/9MPS/HZKP09MZ/FQ59MPSHZKP09MZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZI/JOY0/HZKP09MQ/FZIJOY0HZKP09MQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE7/LYE1/HZKP09MH/FE7LYE1HZKP09MH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH5/52A1/HZKP09MB/FH552A1HZKP09MB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F12/NIF1/HZKP09IC/F12NIF1HZKP09IC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCS/6BUL/HZKP09BJ/FCS6BULHZKP09BJ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Cut and Cut..."}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "The design is very simple, using screws and glue. Nothing fancy, just butt joins. It's very satisfying to see it come together (and quite quickly too).12mm ply is definitely thick enough to put an 18G screw into the side. If you are a purist of some sort, you might prefer pocket screws (I don't have a jig, and I'm sure this would significantly add to the construction time). The joins are glued using 'construction adhesive' - this has the added benefit of filling small gaps caused by inferior workmanship! In this circumstance, the screws are really acting as clamps to hold the glued joint together. There was a huge void in one of the sheets of ply - but a bit of glue and a clamp keeps everything together.The key to a project like this (as with many things in life) is to realise your limitations and work around them. Make as much use as possible of the pre-cut edges, which are generally straight and square (unlike my cuts). Hide wonky edges on the bottom. Use the fact that the sheet is an even thickness to help line everything up. And you can leave a little extra (a little) and sand back your joins for a flush finish.My view on this stage is that this is the 'armature' of a final sculpture. It doesn't have to look too nice, just be structurally sound. And I can assure you that the screws and glue are very sound - the three year old loves to stand on the wings, and they barely dip. The box made from the sides and baseboard is very strong.If I was building this again, I don't think I would make the nose box the same. I don't particularly like the length and angles it makes. I  might just try for a round nose, but that might look funny with a square  front. Probably the best thing is to leave it off all together and put  the propeller straight onto the front panel of the bed. Making the  box was a fun activity in geometry and problem solving though.I started by attaching the sides to the base and the front and back to the base. This gave me a 'box' to work on. Next time I might attach the wings to the sides before attaching to the base, depending on how I feel on the day.The ribs go on next - space them evenly and just screw them into the insides of the box. You need to have cutouts so the outside top of the ribs lines up with the outside of the box.Next up, the canopy. We used a few screws to hold it roughly in place, then a bunch of nails to conform it nicely to the  ribs. Note that it goes from floor to floor (it sits on top of the sides). Even though there were many flats and wonky parts on the ribs, and  they were far from identical, it all went on pretty nicely. There are  voids, but they are hardly noticeable.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FD2/UTMH/HZKWXORB/FD2UTMHHZKWXORB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F45/V18N/HZKWXORC/F45V18NHZKWXORC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2A/CD8N/HZKP09JX/F2ACD8NHZKP09JX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8X/FZF8/HZKP09JM/F8XFZF8HZKP09JM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUN/32P6/HZKWXORA/FUN32P6HZKWXORA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4J/VNZ1/HZKP09N6/F4JVNZ1HZKP09N6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDG/16YP/HZKP09LZ/FDG16YPHZKP09LZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F12/NIF1/HZKP09IC/F12NIF1HZKP09IC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY3/JW4J/HZKP09IP/FY3JW4JHZKP09IP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Assemble the Body"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "This is the trickiest part to line up (I didn't line it up all that well, but fixed it later).

Then screw your aluminium angle  into the side so that it will line up with the bottom of the wings.On  the top wing, I put some heavy twine/light rope under the bracket - this  forms the 'cross brace' of the bottom wing. Before you attach the  wings, make sure you have marked out and drilled a pilot hole where you  want the uprights to go. It's a pain to do it after they are attached  (don't ask me how I know).

So it was glued and screwed. The screws do stick out a bit, since they are placed at an angle to the surface, but it holds together okay.Now how to attach this big heavy box to the front of the plane? Best not to screw and glue it, because you will never get the plane inside the house. I used 'lift off' hinges, one on each side. I intended to use two on each side, but lining up two hinges was hard enough! Trying to get the second set in was nigh impossible, so I gave up.

2009. \u00a0I race my airplane at the Reno Championship Air Races in Reno Nevada. \u00a0These are pylon races which are races which involve 8 airplanes racing around telephone poles in the desert at altitudes as low as 30 feet. \u00a0The formula class is a very affordable class for people interested in racing airplanes and it is also very restrictive (which helps to keep the cost down). \u00a0As a result very little can be done to the engine in particular to increase the speeds on the course. \u00a0This project took approximately three months to complete with two people working on it nights and weekends. \u00a0The cost is less than 10 thousand dollars.\nThe cowling of an experimental aircraft has two primary jobs. \u00a0Fair the engine into the fuselage and provide a cooling opening that cools the engine. \u00a0In the case of the carbon fiber cowling I built for my formula racer Wasabi \u00a0for the 2009 air races I hoped to make the cowling better at both of these jobs.\nFair the engine into the fuselage. \u00a0fundamentally the cowling takes the conical shape of the spinner and continues it around the engine and back to the shape of the fuselage at the firewall. \u00a0The cowling that I had run in 2008 was all aluminum and was therefore pretty boxy. \u00a0By using composites I planned to be able to incorporate more curvy shapes that would result in less drag.\nProvide cooling air to the engine. \u00a0The aluminum cowling that I ran in 2008 provided too much cooling air, over cooling my cylinders to the low 200sF. \u00a0By closing the inlets on this new cowling I hoped to limit the cooling air and by doing so reduce the overall drag of the installation.\nI am going to mostly focus on the handforming of shapes for making composite parts rather than the technical aspects of particular design choices (it is for racing afterall). \u00a0The act of handforming composite plugs is quickly becoming old world as a sanding block is replaced with a CNC mill. \u00a0In the case of this particular project in order to CAD model the cowl I would have neeed a model of the engine which I don't have. \u00a0So I took advantage of the opportunity as a chance to

The number you picked for C is the distance between holes, for me, C was 2\", so I drilled a hole every 2 inches. I thought I was going to use the zig-zag method, (though I miscalculated) so I set it up for the zig-zag. On one side, the first hole was 2\" down ( C ) from the top, the other side started 3\" down ( 1\u00bdC ) and drilled holes at a 2\" interval until I hit the kickboard. (thats the zig-zag setup)\n\u00a0\u00a0 For the length of bungee I got, I should have set it up for the up 'n' over method, which both sides would be parallel, meaning the holes start at C (2\") below the top on both sides and repeat every 2\" (or C).\n\u00a0\u00a0 Starting the bungee run, the back end of the cord needs a knot, preferably a double knot, and tight, as tight as you can get it, I used my Leathermans pliers to pull it tight. You also need to fuse the end with fire, much like you would with rope, to keep it from fraying. That should be quick and painless. Take the opposite, un-knotted end of the bungee and seal it, then thread it through the first hole. Start at the bottom and work up, it will create less tension on the boards at the top.\n\t\tZig-zag method: thread through the bottom two holes and pull all the cord through (the bungee wont go through much more than 3 or 4 holes before it just wont go) then, much like a typical shoelace, go over to the opposite hole above the first, go through it, cross over to next hole up on the opposite side, and repeat all the way to the top.\n\t\tUp 'n' over: Thread the cord through the bottom two holes, pull the cord all the way through (you'll have to do that all the way up :/ just like the zig-zag), go up one hole, repeat all the way to the top.\n\t\tTo get things taught, start at the bottom.

The Table is flipped over onto its side when you need to use the generator and functions as a front wheel rest to stabilize and balance the bike. I built the pedal generator and the table cover from scrap wood and a treadmill that I found in the trash out on the street. For power storage and use I used a Deep Cycle Marine Battery and a 400 Watt Inverter I purchased from Harbor Freight. I also built a voltage regulator using some electrical components from scraps and \u00a0I realize that painting it wasn't quite as green as leaving it au naturale, but I figured the paint would help prevent the wood from rotting and having to build another one. While the generator stand is made from scrap materials I found I did buy the battery and the inverter, as well as some of the components for the Voltage Regulator I couldn't find in E-Waste. I connected the generator input voltage to a Deep Cycle Marine Battery and Inverter through a diode and Voltage Regulator that I made.  I attached the Voltmeter where the Battery typically would be. I did the little backwards pedal hiccup halfway through to show why a heavy flywheel sort of thing is great to have an a pedal powered generator, it helps get the spinning smooth. The reason the Voltage stays up after I finish pedalling is the inverter holding a bit of the charge in a capacitor somewhere I guess. The beep at the end is me turning the inverter on so it drains the little bit of residual it had in its system. Normally the plastic tub with the battery and electronics is inside the house, I just moved it out so the video would be easier to shoot, the cord goes in a slot under the door usually.\u00a0  \u00a0 Finding The treadmill a while back was definitely the impetus for this project. While they aren't something one sees everyday out in the trash, they aren't too hard to come by if you keep your eyes open(and watch craigslist too).I have built bike generators before with broken cordless drills and they are very noisy(best case scenario as loud as a drill), also the drill can't support or balance the weight of a bicycle and that required a stand of some sort to rest bicycle pegs in. I fixed both those problems in this iteration. I hope in the future to build a charge controller to add to the system so I can add some solar panels and/or a wind turbine generator to power the battery(or in future batteries). I'm currently working an a charge controller design I found at\u00a0http://mdpub.com/555Controller/\u00a0.

Using the Formula provided I determined the 100 ohm and 1K would produce the output voltage of 13.75 VDC, which would be suitable to charge the battery. As you can see in the Video in the Intro, the Voltage that ended up coming out was 13.33ish, due to losses to heat and the blocking diode, which is still suitable to charge the battery. There is no protection currently in place against overcharging the battery, my thought being one will be able to monitor the battery while charging, and overcharging will require quite a bit of hard\u00a0pedaling\u00a0and it will be apparent to the generators operator. Whenever I finish the charge controller I will add it to the system so I will also have the option to add solar or wind power to it. I uploaded a schematic below.IMPORTANT: Be sure to attach a substantial heat sink to the LM317 component, it will get pretty hot when you are pedaling as it converts the voltage down for the battery. That being said- Use the Heat if you can- maybe I'll try to add a stirling engine or something in the future, that'd be neat. Though as off now the heat sink is dissipating the heat really well and its not really warming up too much. I attahed the LM317 component to the PC Heatsink using thermal compound and then later a layer or epoxy over the piece to hold it on. I mounted the Voltage Regulator, 12 V deep cycle battery, and inverter in a used Cat Litter Bucket. I picked this container as it held everything and also kept the battery off of the ground. First I hooked the Battery to the 400W inverter I purchased from Harbor Freight. Next was connecting the cables from the generator through the Voltage Regulator to charge the battery. be sure to add a diode to the line between the generator to the voltage regulator as shown so the voltage won't backfeed from the battery to the electric motor. The Diode does cause a small drop in Voltage, but its worth it to not have voltage backfeed through the circuit from the battery or accidentally damage the components if I I happen to hook the generator up in reverse.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F89/W2I4/HGH71Q81/F89W2I4HGH71Q81.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FID/FQTQ/HG85CLHC/FIDFQTQHG85CLHC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKO/9CUD/HGH71Q7S/FKO9CUDHGH71Q7S.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F12/5QAW/HGH6QBVO/F125QAWHGH6QBVO.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Building the Voltage Regulator, Hooking Up the Electronics and Battery"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "The Next Step is to Attach the Generator to the Electronics and Battery.

I used my Dremel to cut the plugs down so they fit the solderless type fittings that the motor already had wired into it. Now the tricky part- You want to connect the generator so it delivers the V+ in and Ground/Negative where its supposed to, and not in reverse or else the whole thing won't work. The Key to figuring this out is to take a voltmeter and measure the voltage on your battery, making note which color probe is on the Positive and which is on the Negative, then compare that reading with what you read from the generator when you spin it by hand the direction the bike will spin it it. For example, If I used my Red Probe on the Positive of the Battery and the Black Probe on the Negative of the Battery, and red a Postive number, then when I switch the Leads to the Generator Output and read a Positive number when it is spun, whatever Lead the Red Probe is attached to is the positive lead.

This supply source enabled me greatly in constructing my project.IntroductionI have always been fascinated with weight training machine design.  I had a bench press weight set at home that did not come with a butterfly attachment so I decided to build my own home gym equipment.  It took me about 3 \u00bd years to complete because I do not have an Industrial Design, Woodworking, or Engineering background.  With my system, a person can (1) perform both the butterfly and lat pulldown exercises transitioning between them with minimal effort and also have the ability to (2) utilize a workout standard where stacking columns of weight (instead of accumulating weight plates) in a moving grid generating even or uneven resistance, by organizing variety of pattern configurations (X,\u25a1, /,\\, --, etc.), using cup shaped ballast inserts.I decided to build with wood because I felt it was a more manageable material than metal: it would be an easier substance to cut, shape, and attach together.  Constructing the frame, creation of the butterfly exerciser arms, fabrication of the weight box, creation of the lat pulldown bar holder, as well as any other appliances to be made and their connections would involve welding equipment and supplies.  Dealing with wood, all I really worried about (besides wood stock) were basically bolts, nuts, and screws, Et al., concerning hardware and various saws, drills, and the like for tooling.The following are a couple of evaluations concerning conventional stacked weight plate exercisers compared with my work.Stacked weight plate machine evaluation #1When increasing weight, an individual must either add whole plates (usually 10 pounds) or, if available, a half add-on plate (usually 5 pounds). If you want to use any weight level in between those values, it is often difficult to do so: both of these could hamper the use of progressive sets and foster overload dynamics.My work Innovation #1My system\u2019s demonstration weight cartridges are \u00bd pound each (about 2 10/16 inches long and 1 14/16 inches in diameter): making them easy to manage.  IF the inserts were made from solid steel roll stock their individual weight would be estimated at around 2 \u00be pound per item. The smaller size increments have the potential to offer more options to those involved in progressive sets and likewise reduce the risk of overload during a circuit.Stacked weight plate machine evaluation #2Machines generally don't change their pattern, meaning you grab a handle, pull a cable, and then draw the stacked weight upward and downward. This can lead to repetitive stress on bones, joints, ligaments, tendons and muscles.  Flexibility is also limited because equipment often concentrates on strengthening a limited number of muscle areas which leaves the surrounding and stabilizing muscles unchallenged (muscle fibers generally require new hurdles to improve). My work Innovation #2 My system\u2019s rate of repetitive stress is more controlled since the force needed to transfer weight is not universal. By changing the configuration of weights in the holder, targeting various muscle areas that need more or less attention (by adding or voiding pockets of stack inserts) accounts for this.  In other words, the integrity of the exercise is not static because the individual can position the solid weight cylinders in organized horizontal/vertical patterns or treat them more as random free weights in the load basket.Motivation My efforts endorse: (1) how to apply simple machine principles (i.e. pulleys, leverage, and weight resistance) in developing a project, (2) promoting a positive message within the DIY universe (i.e. advancing individual knowledge, learning new skills, and the enormous feeling of satisfaction that comes from manufacturing your own things),  (3) woodworking (i.e. which allows a person to be creative and is a wonderful medium for artistic expression) and, (4) inspiring others in the greater inventor community, all in a positive manner.Tools used for the project:\u25cfHole Saw (3/4\u201d)\u25cfCordless Drill\u25cfJig Saw\u25cfBand Saw\u25cfCircular SawMaterials used for the project:\u25cfSpade Drill Bit (7/8\u201c)\u25cf3/8\u201d Drill Bit\u25cfMachine Bolt (1/4\u201d, 5/8\u201d, 3/8\u201d)\u25cfWood Glue\u25cfMachine Screws (#6, #8, #10)\u25cfCarriage Bolts (1/4\u201d)\u25cfCloth Straps  (1 foot long strips that were 1 \u00be inches wide)\u25cfMetal L shaped angle brackets\u25cfWood screws (1\u201c, 1 \u00bd\u201d)\u25cf2 X 4 Wood Pieces\u25cfPlywood (1/2 of an inch thick)\u25cf2\u201d x 2\u201d Furring Strips\u25cfPulleys (3/4\u201d Single Sheave Swivel Eye)\u25cfHose Clamps (1/2 \u2013 29/32)\u25cfPVC Pipe (1 \u00bd\u201d, \u00bd\u201d)\u25cfCotter Pins ( 3/32 X 1\u201d)\u25cfWood Dowel (3/8\u201d, 1 1/8\u201d)\u25cfTape Measure\u25cfCardboard Tubes (3 inches across and 11 inches in length)\u25cfFurniture Movers (4 in total, 3 \u00bd of an inch long, 10/16 of an inch wide, and a height of \u00bc inch)\u25cfCardboard Squares (4 inches long and 3 6/16 inches wide)\u25cfPlastic Squares (4 inches long and 3 6/16 inches wide)\u25cfQuick Dry Cement\u25cfOrange Duct Tape\u25cfElectrical Tape\u25cfNylon Para cord\u25cfEye Bolt (1/4\u201d, 3/8\u201d)\u25cfScrew Eye (1/4\u201d)\u25cfPlastic washers (2\u201d)\u25cfFastener", "title": "Concept Exerciser Prototype", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Concept-Exerciser-Prototype/", "section": "workshop", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I was able to get a steady provision of scrap (or reclaimed) wood material provided by a local source (i.e. a company) nearby. This supply source enabled me greatly in constructing my project.Frame (All plywood material used here was \u00bd inch thick)General I used circular, jig, table, and band saws to help cut the pieces for this section.  1\u201d wood screws, carriage bolts (1/4\u201d), various sized machine bolts (1/4\u201d, 3/8\u201d), and machine screws (#6, #10) were largely used to connect various parts of the frame together.  The entire unit is about 73 inches tall and about 41 inches deep with its width determined by the exercise the user is doing.  For the lat pulldown bar exercise the width of the machine is about 49 inches.  With the butterfly arm exercise the width of the machine becomes about 58 inches.StructureThere are 2 wood center bars located just above the weight box.  These are pieces of 2\u201d x 2\u201d furring strips  held in place with \u00bc\u201d carriage bolts which are 3 \u00bd inches long.  The two upside down \u201cU\u201d shaped center supports, which can be detached from the base, are each 31 inches tall as well as 37 inches long across.  There are attached on the sides with more \u00bc\u201d carriage bolts (2 inches long) as well as a 3/8\u201d machine bolt about 3 \u00bd inches long.The 2 supports in the back of the unit are plywood planks which are 2 inches wide and 34 inches long.  It links the top of the unit to its bottom portion.  \u00bc\u201c machine bolts (2 inches long) were used on the bottom and a metal L shaped angle bracket (6\u201d) along with  wood screws (1\u201d) connecting to those on top.  The large 6\u201d angle bracket was attached with (5) \u00bc\u201d machine bolts that were 2 inches in length.   There are 4 pieces of 2 X 4 which are 31 inches in length each that make up the bottom corners of support for the frame.  The 4 diagonal support legs around it are each about 19 \u00bd inches long and attached to it with 1\u201d wood screws..The two bottom framing pieces on the front and the back of the unit are 2 inches wide and 33 inches each in length.  The two wood brackets near the bottom sides of the exerciser are each about 11 \u00be inches long by \u00be inches wide and their bottom edge was 7 1/2 inches from the floor.  These are all fastened together with 1\u201c wood screws.Rails The rails that the weight box glides on are each about  44 inches tall, 2 inches wide and were held in place with 2 #10 machine screws each 2  \u00be\u201d in length.  The inner track had side bumpers which were \u00bd\u201d wide each with an interior guide space that was 1 inch in measure.  The two top support bars that connect the 2 sets of weight box rails, on the side, are 9 inches long, \u00be inches wide, and about \u00bd of an inch thick and are fastened using #6 machine screws (about 3 inches long with several washers) .  The space between the rails in the front and the back was about 25 \u00bd inches.  The space between the rails on the sides was about 6 \u00be inches.  The rails were located on the frame 3 \u00bd inches inward on the front and the back of the outfit. Another significant detail was figuring out how to make the weight box rise and fall on the movement track while minimizing the friction between itself and the rail surface.  I researched various ways of how to make the friction between the connectors on the weight box and the conduit surfaces it to a minimum.  I considered using various sprays, waxes, greases, lacquers, covers, wheels, and ball bearings to accomplish that.  I ended up sanding the inside of the track extensively and then mounted furniture mover inserts (3 \u00bd of an inch long, 10/16 of an inch wide, and \u00bc inch in height) to the weight box bracket sides for a successful connection. I really had to get used to \u201cbalancing\u201d the weight box when doing repetitions, equal force must be applied on both sides of this simultaneously in order to ensure a smooth glide up and down on the vertical track.

This supply source enabled me greatly in constructing my project.Pulldown Bar Station & Butterfly Arm Support Blades (All plywood material used here was \u00bd inch thick)1\u201d and 1 \u00bd\u201d wood screws and various sizes of machine bolts (1/4\u201d & 5/8\u201d) were some of the elements used to connect many things together in this section.I had to determine the height of the lat pulldown bar from the floor.  It had to be high enough to be out of the way of the butterfly arms but not so high that it was out of reach for a user to grab it from a sitting position.  First, I mimicked the exerciser movement to determine how high from the floor to have the bar while I sat in a chair with full arm extension.  I then knotted a string to the pulldown bar and measured the distance from the start of it to its end on the floor, which turned out to be about 65 inches in height.The pulldown bar box (that supported the lat pull down bar holder and butterfly arm support blades)  was about 11 inches tall, about 14 inches long, and about 7 inches wide.  It\u2019s mounted to a plywood base that\u2019s 15 inches long by 10 \u00bd inches wide.  4 \u00bc\u201d bolts 3 \u00bd inches long secure it to the frame near its front and back with the aid of additional wood screws (1\u201d) and metal L shaped angle brackets (1 \u00bd\u201d).2 pulleys (3/4\u201d Single Sheave Swivel Eye) for the pull down exercise were mounted on wood blocks (2\u201d x 2\u201d furring strips that were 2 \u00bc inches long) positioned about 7 \u00bd inches in front of the pulldown box which were then in turn mounted to a plywood platform (see the upside down \u201cT\u201d diagram that has no header) with \u00bc bolts that were 2 inches long.  The holder for the pulldown bar was about 6 \u00bd inches wide, 8 \u00bc inches long, and 2 \u00bd inches tall.  That assembly was arranged with smaller pieces of wood sewn together by nesting 1\u201d wood screws:4 pieces were, 6 \u00bd inches long, 1 \u00bd inches wide, \u00bd of an inch thick1 piece was, 4 \u00bd inches long, 1 \u00bd inches wide, \u00bd of an inch thick6 pieces were, 8 \u00bd inches long, 2 inches wide, \u00be of an inch thickThere is a release system (utilizing a 3\u201d eye and hook process along with a 4 inch hinge) that does free up the lat pulldown bar as needed (which itself was a 1 1/8\u201d Poplar wood dowel that was 48 inches long).A wood hold down arrangement, on either side of the back, of the unit works along with a large bolt (5/8\u201dand about 4 \u00bd inches long) with corresponding washers (5 of them) in order to keep the butterfly support blades in place without shifting their position during the exerciser\u2019s operation.  The hold down bracket was an oddly shaped object (see diagram A) which was mounted to the frame with metal L shaped angle brackets (1 \u00bd\u201d) and wood screws (1\u201d).  The wood blades are each 33 inches long and actually made up of 3 pieces of wood (for a total height of 1 \u00bd\u201d inches s tall joined together with 1\u201d wood screws .  There were a series of connectors (2, \u00bc\u201d screw eyes, 1, 3/8\u201d eye bolt, and 2, 2\u201c inch metal L brackets) attached to, and by, the blades that were then connected to several bungee cords used to suspend the butterfly arms on the mid air track system.2 other pulleys (3/4\u201d Single Sheave Swivel Eye) were mounted just below the pulldown bar box on the frame; they were measured 12 inches in from the right and left edge.  A nylon para cord (75 inches long) was used to connect the lat pulldown bar to the weight box.Note: the values of the measurements in diagram A and the upside down \u201cT\u201d diagram (with no header) are all in inches.A clip setup helped to connect the para cord line from the weight box to both the butterfly exerciser and the lat pulldown bar.

This supply source enabled me greatly in constructing my project.Butterfly Arms (All plywood material used was 1/2 inch thick)1\u201d wood screws as well as various sizes of machine bolts (1/4\u201d), cotter pins (3/32 x 1\u201d), and plastic washers (2\u201d), and machine screws (#8) were some of the elements used to connect many things together in this section.I determined the length of the butterfly arms by mimicking the exercises movement and motion.  Next, I manipulated a flexible tube and made a \u201cC\u201d type shape in order to determine the appropriate distance forward necessary from the main unit\u2019s frame.  Finally, I marked and measured the appropriate distance when I laid it out straight: which came out to be around 44 inches long.I also had to figure out how to do a circular arc turn using blocks of wood (2\u201d x 2\u201d furring strips). I overcame this by creating a jackknife motion, involving those connected together with linkage joints made from PVC pipe.The butterfly arms (actually three separate blocks of wood) were attached together with the use of a \u00bd inch PVC tube 7 \u00bd inches long (a 7/8 spade bit was used to drill the holes for that activity on either side of each of the links) with cotter pins (3/32 X 1\u201d) in coordination with plastic washers (2\u201d) were used as well as a couple of hose clamps (1/2 \u2013 29/32).  The block closest to the machine was about 13 \u00bd inches long, the mid block was still about 13 \u00bd inches in length, and the block furthest from the exerciser  was 15 \u00bd inches long in measure.5 wood planks on each butterfly arm held the 2 x 2 inch furring strip blocks together.  They were mounted with \u00bc\u201d carriage bolts that were 3 inches long.  Moving from closest to the machine and migrating forward, here are the board measurements:Board #1: 1 \u00bd inches wide, 21 \u00bd inches longBoard #2: 2 inches wide, 24 inches longBoard #3: 2 inches wide, 24 inches longBoard #4: 2 inches wide, 21 \u00bd inches longBoard #5: 2 inches wide, 21 \u00bd inches longEach of the arm paddles of the butterfly arms compilation were blocks of wood that were 2 \u00bd inches wide, 18 inches long and 1 \u00bd inches in height.  Two pieces of \u00bd\u201d PVC tube piping, 6 inches long, also attached with help from cotter pins (3/32 X 1\u201d) and plastic washers (2\u201d) connected them to the housing, on both ends that allowed them to swivel while in use.  A #8 machine screw (2 \u00be inches long) held the PVC pipe segment that protruded from both ends of the arm paddles.  Three \u00bc\u201d eye screws were used to complete the para cord circuit from the weight box and this piece of equipment.  There were three adjustable fabric straps, 1 \u00be inches wide, located on the arm paddles for the user to make as loose or tight as deemed fit.  In addition, a strap on top of the butterfly arm helped the user lift it off and put it back on the frame when needed.There were 5 bungee cords on the butterfly arms attached to a series of eye bolts (3/8\u201d & \u00bc\u201d) on the bottom of the butterfly arm support blades that allowed it to glide forward in mid air and recoil back into starting position when done.The butterfly arms used many pulleys (3/4\u201d Single Sheave Swivel Eye) to work its operations. 2 pulleys on either side of the exerciser were attached to wood blocks (2\u201d x 2\u201d furring strips that were 3 \u00bd inches and 6 \u00bc inches long respectively) who were themselves attached to the frame with \u00bc\u201d machine bolts about 3 inches in length.  The pulleys were also attached to the blocks of wood with 1/4\" machine bolts that were 2 1/2 inches long and were located on the outside edges of those pieces.  I made a wood stop for the butterfly arms attached on either side of the frame that was 10 inches long and 1 \u00bd inches wide.  It had three wood prongs on it with the front and the back being 2 \u00bc long and 1 \u00bc wide.  The middle one was 4 inches long and 1 \u00bd inches wide (raised up 1 \u00bd inches high) all held together with 1\u201d wood screws. 2 other pulleys were mounted just below the pull down bar box on the frame; they were measured about 12 inches in from the right and left edge.  A nylon para cord (about 112 inches long) was used to connect the butterfly arms to the weight box.3/8\u201d dowel pegs (1/2 of an inch long) kept the butterfly arms locked in position when not in use along with a bungee chord attached to the exerciser frame with a 1\" wood screw.A clip setup helped to connect the para cord line from the weight box to both the butterfly exerciser and the lat pulldown bar.

This supply source enabled me greatly in constructing my project.Weight Box (All plywood material used here was 1/2 inch thick)1\u201d and 1 \u00bd\u201d wood screws including of machine screws (#10), and machine bolts (1/4\u201d), were some of the elements used to connect many things together in this section.The weight box is 6 cardboard tubes (about 3 inches across, about 11 inches long, and 10/16 thick) joined together with 4 pieces of flat cardboard (about 10 inches long and 6 \u00bd inches wide) mounted to them (2 in the front and 2 in the back) with wood glue.  The weight carriage has overall dimensions of about 14 \u00bd inches wide, about 24 inches long, and about 4 \u00bd inches high.  There are 7 view ports on each tube (the holes drilled into the weight box were done with a \u00be\u201d hole saw by freehand and not on a drill press) so a viewer can tell how full each weight each tube was during a given time.  The edges of those were spaced about \u00be of an inch apart and were visually centered on each of the drop cylinders.  I had to figure out how to represent weight in the exercise system without using flat plates, while being confined in a small amount of space (without compromising adaptability and/or portability).  I overcame this by representing weight as \u201ccups\u201d of mass.  I ended up taking a 1 \u00bd\u201d tube of PVC pipe and cut it length wise about 2 10/16 inches.  I then used a 2\u201d hole saw to cut a circle out of plastic and then glued and taped it to the bottom of the tube in order to get the cup shape I desired.  After I secured the cup bottom, I filled it with quick dry cement and then covered it in orange duct tape in order to achieve a bright color so a user could see a noticeable change in the view ports as the insert dropped through the weight box.  My exerciser uses a container (it itself weighs about 25 lbs.) that can hold up to 24 cylinder inserts (instead of using weight plates) to change the amount of force a user exerts for each movement.  Wood pegs about 4 \u00bc inches long are used to suspend the cup weights in individual positions in the tubes themselves.  When not in use, weights can be placed in the grid container for compact storage.There are two flap covers, they are 2 \u00bc inches were 7 \u00be inches long (held together with 3 inch hinges using \u00bd\u201d machine screws) on either side on top of the weight box used to help keep weight inserts in the assembly as it was being used.  They stay open or closed as needed when the bungee cords are connected to its central housing 2 \u00bd wide, 12 inches wide, and 2 \u00bd inches high.There is an extension that sticks out of the outer edge of the flaps about 2 \u00bd inches further than the main part itself (it\u2019s also about \u00bc wide):  the entire length of this piece was 5 inches.  They stay open or closed as needed when the bungee chords are connected to its central housing 2 \u00bd wide, 12 inches wide, and 2 \u00bd inches high.The top of the weight box (where the two anchor clasps connect to \u00bc\u201d eye bolts which enable the weight box to rise and fall evenly) is a plywood section 2 \u00bd inches wide and 26 inches long.  It\u2019s connected to its center support column by (8) 1\u201d wood screws.  It\u2019s also notched in the front of it to allow the flap extension to pivot back and forth with ease: this is 9 2/16 inches from center and up by \u00bd of an inch on both sides.The brackets that attach the weight box and allow it to glide on the exerciser\u2019s 4 rails were secured to it by 1 \u00bd inch long #10 machine screws (on the tubes themselves are inserts that those attached to) were 7 \u00bc long by 6 \u00bd inches wide.  A center piece of wood (6 1/4 inches long, 1 \u00bc inches wide, and 3/4 of an inch in height) on it adds for stability and small furniture movers, 3 \u00bd of an inch long, 10/16 of an inch wide, and a height of \u00bc inch, (on either side of the fixture) ride on the rail grooves to help hold it in place as it moves up and down.On the bottom of each tube were cardboard slots which held thin pieces of cardboard or plastic (4 inches long by 3 \u00bd inches wide) that insured no weights would go all the way through the tubes unexpectedly.A couple of wood strips  that were attached to the top of the weight box and controlled by the vertical stops (on the frame) were 2 inches wide and 8 inches long (held in position by (7) 1\u201d wood screws on either side). The weight box is suspended 1 foot off the ground in its resting position and about 6 \u00bd inches from the top edge of the draw box.  4 bracket assemblies used 3 inch straight and metal L shaped pieces (1 \u00bd\u201d) using wood screws (1 \u00bd inch) and machine bolts (1/4\u201d and \u00be inches long) to support pieces of wood which were 2 \u00bd inches long and 1 \u00bc inches wide..On the back of the weight box are 2 crossbars of wood (13 inches long and 1 inch wide) which added additional stability to it as it traveled up and down during operation.  Support wood from the primary one were about 6 inches long and 1 inch wide.  2 other pieces of wood in the back of the unit (10 inches long and 2 inches wide) also provided support here.  The top of the weight box, in the back, was connected to its center column by the way of the bars of wood held together with 1\" wood screws.Angle cardboard (3 \u00be inches in length) was fastened with wood glue to either side of each of the weight box tubes.  These helped to keep the slot weight stops in place. Fabric straps on top of the weight box allow a user to take it out and place it back again on the rail system for use.A clip setup helped to connect the para cord line from the weight box to both the butterfly exerciser and the lat pulldown bar.  I added a fastener, tightened with a couple of cotter pins, to help keep that item taut in the clip arrangement.The overall design, of this section, was based on a loose interpretation of the Connect 4 game.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5X/CFNT/IN238PGP/F5XCFNTIN238PGP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFF/3VG1/IN238PGN/FFF3VG1IN238PGN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF1/D58N/IN238PGO/FF1D58NIN238PGO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF0/VNFK/IN238SSU/FF0VNFKIN238SSU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSN/6G04/IN238SSY/FSN6G04IN238SSY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXN/7V9U/IN238PBR/FXN7V9UIN238PBR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2J/HI74/IN238OZQ/F2JHI74IN238OZQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FML/6GR2/IN238Q3H/FML6GR2IN238Q3H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNR/8YMA/IN238PPK/FNR8YMAIN238PPK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFK/BF1N/IN238P07/FFKBF1NIN238P07.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7Y/U6ET/IN238PBS/F7YU6ETIN238PBS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKQ/W6QP/IN238SA2/FKQW6QPIN238SA2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FK1/DOD0/IN238PPD/FK1DOD0IN238PPD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF7/7AU6/IN238Q3G/FF77AU6IN238Q3G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU7/PS7V/IN238SAT/FU7PS7VIN238SAT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYX/7LQE/IN238SBN/FYX7LQEIN238SBN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIS/65ZS/IN238R20/FIS65ZSIN238R20.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWF/ZZ27/IN238QXM/FWFZZ27IN238QXM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F38/3BIG/IN238R07/F383BIGIN238R07.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUO/XS0L/IN238SQM/FUOXS0LIN238SQM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG6/Z2GE/IN238X85/FG6Z2GEIN238X85.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGZ/8CHB/IN238XVZ/FGZ8CHBIN238XVZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL8/D514/IN238XW3/FL8D514IN238XW3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTL/8ZJ9/IN238Y85/FTL8ZJ9IN238Y85.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN9/S7XH/IN238Y88/FN9S7XHIN238Y88.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIG/3ZI3/IN238Y8X/FIG3ZI3IN238Y8X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3N/POA1/IN238YSD/F3NPOA1IN238YSD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU3/4POC/IN238YUI/FU34POCIN238YUI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNJ/LXDZ/IN238YVF/FNJLXDZIN238YVF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR7/ZAOD/IN238YXF/FR7ZAODIN238YXF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F51/X8EZ/IN238ZKZ/F51X8EZIN238ZKZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6V/UQOT/IN238ZJ7/F6VUQOTIN238ZJ7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIP/KDH6/IN238ZJS/FIPKDH6IN238ZJS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F07/DITC/IN238ZM0/F07DITCIN238ZM0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYP/ZW7C/IN239093/FYPZW7CIN239093.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHW/GD2F/IN238ZMP/FHWGD2FIN238ZMP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNJ/TBV5/IN23908E/FNJTBV5IN23908E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJJ/9FZL/IN23909S/FJJ9FZLIN23909S.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCR/OGPF/IN23909T/FCROGPFIN23909T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPL/LKE2/IN2390VC/FPLLKE2IN2390VC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1F/4RAL/IN2390VS/F1F4RALIN2390VS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYW/DIBM/IN2390WK/FYWDIBMIN2390WK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7C/AGY6/IN2390XO/F7CAGY6IN2390XO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXY/6737/IN2390Y4/FXY6737IN2390Y4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS9/87G2/IN2390YT/FS987G2IN2390YT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2N/2TCY/IN7ONT50/F2N2TCYIN7ONT50.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2F/HPX0/IN7ONT7I/F2FHPX0IN7ONT7I.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Exerciser Weight Box"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "I was able to get a steady provision of scrap (or reclaimed) wood material provided by a local source (i.e. a company) nearby.

A long pipe with an interior diameter no smaller in interior diameter than 3 inches (the bigger the interior diameter of the pipe, the better)  2. 8 bolts or screws  that  can reach the radius of your pipe (these will be used to hold your ball bearings in place (see item 6))3. A rod 1foot longer than your pipe4. Fasteners to hold the forms of the wind turbine blade in place5. Three Forms(These are made by taking the interior diameter of the pipe (in inches)-subtracting 1/2 inch to get the length of the form, adding 1/2 inch to the diameter of the rod to get the width,and by cutting the diamond shape out  of 1/4 inch to 1/2 inch thick wood).6. 2 ball bearings, 1for each end of the pipe. (The diameter of the inner ring of the ball bearings should be the same or slightly larger than the exterior diameter of the rod). 7. 2 small pieces of pipe that fit snugly around the ball bearings. 8.Some 1 millimeter thick foam9. Something to mount your wind turbine mount to (I used a tripod made for mounting large satellite dishes on).10. Something to mount you wind turbine on (I used PVC pipe, zip ties, and rubber strips to mount my wind turbine.11. A DC motor or alternator to generate electricity with. ( I used an RC car motor)12. Something to connect your rod to your generator (I used a wooden dowel with a hole drilled through the center).13. Some wood to make the tail fin for the wind turbine and the three forms.14. PVC pipe to attach your tail fin to your wind turbine pipe.15. Duct Tape (to hold certain  things together)(Its the best stuff in the world):-)16. Something to attach your generator to the wind turbine tube with ( I used wood and zip ties).Everything mentioned here can be bought at Home Depot except for the generator/ DC motor/ alternator, the tripod, and maybe the foam.

We had the choice to learn something new, hone a specific discipline, or develop a method to teach the class about a specific subject. In my mind, I knew that I wanted to find a project that encompassed all three of these criteria. This is how I, along with my classmate Ian Kelley, stumbled upon building our first wind tunnel.  Going into this project, we did not know much about wind tunnels, much less how to build one. After our build, we published a guide on Instructables (available here). Within a few days, it grew on a humongous, unanticipated scale. We were able to receive feedback from individuals that were experts in the field of aerodynamics and fluid dynamics. Inspired by their support and constructive criticism, we went back to the drawing board and asked ourselves what could we do to improve our design. After a long iterative process, we were able to compile and assimilate the suggested ideas and started to build. This ible is meant more as a guide to learn from and is meant to work in tandem to the first guide. Some specific details may be left out intentionally to allow for a certain degree of independence and creativity. Experiment!.

From cars, airplanes, and space-faring vehicles, to buildings, bridges, and skyscrapers, knowledge and understanding gained from wind tunnel research provides a conduit for mankind's drive for innovation.  Now how does a wind tunnel work? Well the physics behind it are based off of the work of Daniel Bernoulli, a Swiss physicist. Many might remember him from the equation that you learned in physics back in high school of constant= P + 1/2 p v^2 + p g h. An equation he helped contribute to, the continuity expression in physics of A1V1=A2V2. This provides the foundation of wind tunnels by showing how if you decrease the cross sectional area, your speed subsequently increases.

While researching about the way other wind tunnels are designed, we encountered that many of the tunnels had intakes that similar to a bell shape or like the profile of speakers. This design is advantageous since it helps amplify the sound waves into the air from a compact source. For the tunnel, the opposite effect is achieved with this design, taking in a lot of air and channeling it into a directed flow to the test bed of the tunnel.  The intake additionally functions to speed up the air incoming due to the conservation of energy, where A1V1=A2V2 (A=Cross sectional area, V=Velocity of fluid). When air enters the tunnel, it has a larger area and slow speed, but when the area shrinks, the speed increases. As a result, the overall speed of the air across the test section is increased by a certain factor. The design increased speed by a factor of two. However, I am certain that this factor is a rough estimate since the density of the air is assumed to be constant and uniform with the friction between the air and material is overlooked.

Put simply, the array of straws allow for the turbulent air to flow into the wind tunnel smoothly, achieving what is known as laminar flow (smooth flow).  Here is a really good visual that I found that explains the difference: here.  When I was making my flow straightener, I recall learning from feedback on my last guide that the dimensions of the honeycomb array of flow straighteners should fall within a certain range of values dictated by an equation known as the Reynolds Number (wiki link).  Essentially, the equation goes as such:  \"Re=  \u03c1vD/\u03bc, where \u03c1 is the density of the fluid (air in our case), v is the velocity, D is the diameter of the pipe the fluid is going through, and \u00b5 is the dynamic viscosity\" (Instructables user Hawkeye_bkj [Thank you for the help]).  It was also recommended that I achieve a Reynolds number around 2300.  With the dimensions of the given straws that I bought and some research, I was able to determine that I needed roughly have a fan that would be able to reach 5m/s (11.2 mph).  This was wonderful because during trails with my teacher's wind speed indicator, I was able to reach a value close to 11.2 mph with slight variations that would put the Reynolds number a tad lower.  But that was something I was able to live with.  Making the honeycomb array took quite a while.  I ended up going through I would say 8 or more packets of drinking straws.  I would cut the straws in thirds into roughly 7cm sections and line them up for gluing.  Since there were literally a few thousand of straws to cut, I did not bother making it terribly accurate, compensating by making the exhaust of the straw line uniform but not the intake (see image 2, the back vs image 6, the front).  Layer upon layer, I slowly glued the straws together with Elmers glue and eventually resulted in an array that looked beautiful.

This was supplemented with 4 long pieces that formed a 45-45-90 degree triangle with the square cross section, making the shape an octagon. Two leftover Lexan sheets were cut to the same width as the long pieces to act as a clear bridge between the sides. The integration of lights within the tunnel were added along with a black construction paper backdrop to optimize visualization of the smoke.  This was a relatively simple design and cheap.

It is a section of the wind tunnel that opens up slowly, increasing the cross sectional area slowly over a long distance.  Essentially, the role of the diffuser is to slow down the air that speeds past the models in the test section.  According to the website that provides great animations for each part of the wind tunnel (the diffuser one available here), the speeds are slowed down such that the fans do not have to run as fast which results in a cheaper operation of the fans.  This makes sense using the continuity equation (A1V1=A2V2) since with as the air enters the diffuser, A1 is low and V1 is high and when the diffuser opens up at the other end, A2 increases resulting in a decreased V2.  Slower fan speeds results in less power output by the motors which in turn results in less usage of a power source and more money saved.  Key attributes of my diffuser was that it is very modular, being able to fold up from being a large roughly 15\" X 15\" X 40\" rectangular prism to a 30\" X 1\" X 40\" flat board.

The set up that I utilize currently is the cheapest and simplest one that I have found in relation to the smoke being created.   A really good trail of smoke can be created from the dry ice + hot water combo with the drawback of having to replace the solution with new ice and water after a certain time.  I would recommend it over using incense or a fog machine as of now due to the dangers involved with the machine and the dizziness induced by the smoke.  The way that flow is controlled was developed by my genius partner, Ian.  Using simple wire coat hangers, he was able to unbend them such that they took the shape of a hoop with a small loop on the top.  By placing half into the tunnel, we are able to manipulate the direction of the smoke by pushing it either left or right, up or down, or a combo of both.  Versatility is a key attribute to this design.  For making the device, 3 Styrofoam cups were used.  Two of them were first stacked within another with a hole added to the side for the tubing.  With this, the top of another cup is sliced off and added to the original set up inverted such that a sealed compartment can be achieved.  Some plastic wrap was added so that the volume of the container would be smaller, allowing for the smoke formed through the reaction between dry ice and hot water to flow through the tube easier and not get stuck in the vessel. ***Exercise safety while working with dry ice and hot water!

The aesthetics of the fan was also vital to the wind tunnel as a whole since it was an integral part to the instrument as a whole.  Therefore, it was spray painted with a black and gold color scheme (our school's colors) and a red top for cautionary purposes.

You can read more about our vision for the future of transportation on our website, our facebook, our twitter, and our subreddit. You can also see extracts from our Final Design Briefing here (the full package is going to be released with errata shortly).What is the Hyperloop?Hyperloop is a high-speed transportation system initially proposed by Elon Musk in 2013. The concept uses safe and reliable ground based transit at supersonic speeds to traverse large distances in a superior method than current modes of transportation. A pod carrying passengers and/or cargo is levitated inside a partially-reduced-pressure tube, eliminating rolling resistance and greatly reducing air resistance. To accelerate its development, SpaceX is hosting a competition for engineering teams to design their own hyperloop pods and test them at a SpaceX facility in Hawthorne, California, in the summer of 2016. For the purpose of validating our CFD results, we wanted to build a wind tunnel and test a 3D print of an iteration of our pod design.

SAVE YOUR SCRAP WOOD!SIXSame process as the Contraction Cone, connect the boards together. This time is easier, as you can use the fan/drive section at the base to mount the boards. NOTE: you will need the power supply for the fan to be accessible. For this, I drilled a hole at the base of the drive section big enough for the cable to fit through, then ran the power cable out before mounting to the diffuser boards (visible in video at beginning of instructable).SEVENAt the drive section there will be a gap due to the way the boards will mount. This is unavoidable, but can easily be patched with some sealant or lots of silicone. As with contraction cone, run silicone along seam to ensure air tightness.EIGHTAs with contraction cone, build a base so the diffuser runs along same axis as contraction and test section. I used scrap wood to achieve this. Some measurements should be taken to ensure you are as close to aligned as possible. The diffuser base will be a bit more difficult as both ends will need to be raised, where the inlet of the contraction cone can rest on the floor. NINEIn order to get an idea of how fast the air is moving in the test section, an economical method is to mount a personal fan just inside the diffuser section (where it would interface with test section). Instead of connecting batteries, wire a multimeter to the fan. Later, as you are testing your fan the multimeter will give you a voltage output. You can use this number to convert to airspeed.

You want to be very careful and precise at this step so that your readings are accurate. First, drill a hole in the centre of the base of your test section just large enough to accommodate the threaded rod that will mount your test model to your 'lift' sensor. You want to make sure the rod won't touch the test section even when the fan is in operation.Next, determine the best way to mount your force sensors to the base of the test section. Again, I used scrap wood to achieve this. One sensor will connect with the threaded rod going vertical in to the test section to measure lift, and the other must be mounted at a right angle and perfectly aligned with the threaded rod to measure drag. The image above gives you an idea of how they should be mounted, but was not my final mounting position. You can see the threaded rod for my drag sensor is not perfectly perpendicular. I also sanded down the sides of the threaded rod for the drag sensor so it was smooth on the end and wouldn't catch on threads from lift sensor rod.Once you have them satisfactorily mounted, you need to calibrate the sensor before performing any tests. Plug the sensor interface into your computer using a USB. I used a FlowBotics app to set up and record data from sensors. These sensors have a rated output of 1.0+/-0.15mv/V and a precision of 0.05%. To calibrate each sensor, a reading with no force is measured and plugged in to the following equation:  B (offset) = 0 - 5 * Measured OutputTo convert the measured mv/V output from the load sensor to the measured force:Measured Force = A * Measured mv/V + B (offset) Where A is equal to the capacity of the sensor, in this case 5kg.Another method to check calibration is to define the weight of the model on the rod as 0 lbs/Newtons, then put a known weight on the model (such as a 100g weight which exerts a .98 N force on the model) and define the force measured by the sensor. As this force is pushing downward on the lift sensor, you should define it as a negative number so your test results will come back positive.

With two weeks lead time, I was curious if I could both plan and execute a motion sensitive LED animation hat. Turns out I could! I probably went a little overboard, but the total project cost around $80. With experimentation and some coding you could do it for less.The goal with the hat was the following:Have a set of lights move from the center front of the hat to the back, one light on each side Change the speed of the light's travel dictated by the tilt of the hat front to back Allow the lights to reverse when the hat band was tilted downward (i.e. emulate gravity's effect on the lights) Change color based on the tilt of the hat left to right Sense shocks, and display a special effect Sense the wearer spinning, and display a special effect Have it completely contained in the hat", "title": "Fancy LED Hat", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Fancy-LED-Hat/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I used the following major components (non-affiliate Amazon links included):Teensy LC microcontroller - I chose this over a regular Arduino due to its small size, and it having a special connection for controlling my LEDs, as well as strong library and community support.

There are much less expensive options, however once you figure out the Bosch it does a lot for you that you would otherwise have to do in code WS2812 addressable LED strip - I chose a 1 meter length with 144 LEDs per meter. Having that density helps the light look more like it is moving, rather than individual elements lighting up in sequence.And the following minor components:A hat - any hat with a hatband will do. This is a $6 hat from a local store. If it has a seam in the back it will be easier to get the wiring through.

The first smaller pocket towards the front is pointed like the hat itself so that when the electronics are installed the positional sensor is held in place fairly well, yet can be easily removed if necessary. The second pocket towards the back is to hold the battery pack in place.The pockets were sown with thread that matched the color of the hat, all long the crown line. Depending on the style of hat and materials it is made of YMMV with this technique.We also discovered the hat band tucks into itself on one side, and it was fully sewn to the hat in that location. We had to remove the original seam in order to run the LEDs under the band. During the build it was held in place with pins, and then sewn with matching thread when completed.Finally we opened the seam on the back of the hat were it is covered by the band. We tucked the wire harness that came with the LEDs through that seam and lined the first LED in the strip to be right on the seam. We then wrapped the LEDs around the hat and cut the strip down so that the last LED would be right next to the first.

This is why I chose to use 3 AAA batteries, the output voltage of 4.5v is nicely in that range, and they have plenty of runtime for the way I've programmed the LEDs to work. You should be able to get well over 8 hours of runtime.Wiring the powerI wired the positive and negative leads from the battery box and LEDs together, then soldered onto the Teensy in appropriate locations. The positive from the battery needs to be connected to the top right pin of the Teensy in the diagram (labelled Vin on the board), and the negative can be wired to any pin labelled GND. Conveniently there is one directly on the opposite side of the board, or right next to the Vin pin. The full pinout diagram for the board can be found on the bottom of this page. And in some cases a paper copy is included when you order the board.If you are planning on running code that only has a few LEDs turned on at a single time, you can power the LEDs from the Teensy itself, by using a 3.3v output and GND, however if you try to pull too much power you can damage the board. So to give yourself the most options it is best to wire the LEDs to your battery source directly.Wiring the LEDsI chose the Teensy LC for this project as it has a pin that makes it much easier to wire up addressable LEDs. On the bottom of the board the pin that is second from the left mirrors Pin #17, but also has 3.3v on it. This is referred to as a pull-up, and on other boards you would have to wire in a resistor to provide that voltage. In the case of the Teensy LC you can just wire from that pin straight to your LEDs data wire.Wiring the position sensorSome of the BNO055 boards available are much more strict on voltage and only want 3.3v. Because of this, I wired the Vin on the BNO055 board from the dedicated 3.3v output on the Teensy, which is the 3rd pin down on the right. You can then connect the GND on the BNO055 to any GND on the Teensy. The BNO055 position sensor uses I2c to talk to the Teensy. I2c requires pull-ups, so I wired two 4.7K ohm resistors from a 3.3v output on the Teensy to pins 18 and 19. I then wired pin 19 to the SCL pin on the BNO055 board, and 18 to the SDA pin.Wiring tips/tricksTo do this project I used solid wire rather than stranded. One advantage to solid wire is while soldering to prototype boards like these. You can strip some wire, bend it to 90 degrees, and insert it through the bottom of one of the terminals, so that the cut end of the wire is sticking up above your board. You then only need a small amount of solder to hold it to the terminal, and you can cut off the excess easily.The solid wire can be more difficult to work with as tends to want to stay how it is bent. However for this project that was an advantage. I cut and shaped my wires in such a way that the orientation of the positional sensor would be consistent as I inserted and removed the electronics from the hat for tweaking and programming.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F4S/P9M1/JHATLUXU/F4SP9M1JHATLUXU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Wire It Up"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Now that everything is assembled you will need an Arduino compatible programming tool. I used the actual Arduino IDE (works with Linux, Mac, and PC). You will also need the Teensyduino software to interface with the Teensy board. This project heavily uses the FastLED library to do the color and position programming of the LEDs.  CalibratingThe first thing you will want to do is go to Kris Winer's excellent GitHub repository for the BNO055 and download his BNO_055_Nano_Basic_AHRS_t3.ino sketch. Install that code with the Serial Monitor running and it'll tell you if the BNO055 board properly comes online and passes its self tests. It will also walk you through calibrating the BNO055, which will give you more consistent results later.Getting started with the Fancy LED sketchThe code for the Fancy LED hat specifically is attached, and also on my GitHub repository. I plan on making more tweaks to the code and those will be posted on the GitHub repo. The file here reflects the code when this Instructable was published. After downloading and opening the sketch, there are a few things you will need to change. Most of the important values to change are in the very top as #define statements:Line 24: #define NUM_LEDS 89 - change this to the actual number of LEDs on your LED stripLine 28: #define SERIAL_DEBUG false - you will probably want to make this true, so that you can see output on the serial monitorPosition detection codePosition detection and most of your tweaking starts at line 742, and goes through 802. We get Pitch, Roll, and Yaw data from the position sensor and use it to set values. Depending on how your electronics are mounted you may need to change these. If you mount the position sensor with the chip towards the top of the hat, and the arrow next to X printed on the board pointed towards the front of the hat you should see the following:Pitch is nodding your headRoll is tilting your head, e.g. touch your ear to your shoulderYaw is which direction. you are facing (North, West, etc).If your board is mounted in a different orientation you will need to swap Pitch/Roll/Yaw for them to behave how you would like.To adjust the Roll settings you can change the following #define values:ROLLOFFSET: with your hat stable and as centered as it can be, if the Roll isn't 0, change this by the difference. I.e. if you are seeing Roll at -20 when your hat is centered, make this 20.ROLLMAX: the maximum value to use for Roll measurement. Easiest to find by wearing the hat and moving your right ear towards your right shoulder. You'll need a long USB cable to do this while using the serial monitor.ROLLMIN: the lowest value to use for Roll measurement, for when your tilting your head leftSimilarly, for Pitch:MAXPITCH - the maximum value when you are looking upMINPITCH - the minimum value when you are looking downPITCHCENTER - the pitch value when you are looking straight forwardIf you set SERIALDEBUG to true at the top of the file you should see the current values for Roll/Pitch/Yaw output to the serial monitor to help tweak these values.Other parameters you may want to changeMAX_LED_DELAY 35 - the slowest that the LED particle can move. This is in milliseconds. It is the delay from moving from one LED to the next in the string.MIN_LED_DELAY 10 - the fasted that the LED particle can move. As above it is in milliseconds.ConclusionIf you have gone this far, you should have a fully functioning, and fun, LED hat! If you want to do more with it, the next page has some advanced information on changing settings, and doing your own things. as well as some explanation of what the rest of my code is doing.

You can tweak the sensitivity of it with the following lines in initBNO055():Line #316: BNO055_ACC_HG_DURATION - how long the event has to lastLine #317: BNO055_ACC_HG_THRESH - how hard the impact needs to beLine #319: BNO055_GYR_HR_Z_SET - rotation speed thresholdLine #320: BNO055_GYR_DUR_Z - how long the rotation even has to lastBoth values are 8 bit binary, currently the impact is set to B11000000, which is 192 out of 255. When an impact or spin is detected the BNO055 sets a value which the code looks for right at the beginning of the Loop: // Detect any interrupts triggered, i.e. due to high G    byte intStatus = readByte(BNO055_ADDRESS, BNO055_INT_STATUS);  \n    if(intStatus > 8) {\n      impact();\n    } else if(intStatus > 0) {\n      spin();\n    }Look for the void impact() line above in the code to change the behavior on impact, or void spin() to change the spin behavior. HelpersI've created a simple helper function (void setAllLeds()) for quickly setting all the LEDs to a single color. One use it to turn them all off: setAllLeds(CRGB::Black);Or you can pick any color recognized by the FastLED library: setAllLeds(CRGB::Red);There is also a fadeAllLeds() function that will dim all the LEDs by 25%.The Particle classIn order to greatly simplify wiring I wanted to use a single string of LEDs, but have them behave like multiple strings. Since this was my first try I wanted to keep it as simple as possible, so I treat the one string as two, with the middle LED(s) being there the split would be. Since we could either have an even number or an odd number, we need to account for that. I start with some global variables:/* * Variable and containers for LEDs\n */\nCRGB leds[NUM_LEDS];\n\nstatic unsigned int curLedDelay = MAX_LED_DELAY;\nstatic int centerLed = NUM_LEDS / 2;\nstatic int maxLedPos = NUM_LEDS / 2;static bool oddLeds = 0;\nstatic bool particleDir = 1;\nstatic bool speedDir = 1;unsigned long dirCount;\nunsigned long hueCount;And some code in setup():if(NUM_LEDS % 2 == 1) {     oddLeds = 1;\n     maxLedPos = NUM_LEDS/2;\n  } else {\n     oddLeds = 0;\n     maxLedPos = NUM_LEDS/2 - 1;\n  }If we have odd numbers, we want to use the 1/2 point as the middle, otherwise we want the 1/2 point - 1. This is easy to see with 10 or 11 LEDs:11 LEDs: 11/2 with integers should evaluate to 5. and computers count from 0. So  0 - 4 is one half, 6 - 10 is the other half, and 5 is between them. We treat #5 in this case as if it was part of both, i.e. it is #1 for both virtual strings of LEDs10 LEDs: 10/2 is 5. But since computers count from 0 we need to remove one. Then we have 0 - 4 for one half, and 5 - 9 for the other. #1 for the first virtual string will be 4, and #1 for the second virtual string will be #5.Then in our particle code we have to do some counting from our overall position to the actual positions on the LED string:if(oddLeds) {        Pos1 = centerLed + currPos;\n        Pos2 = centerLed - currPos;\n      } else {\n        Pos1 = centerLed + currPos;\n        Pos2 = (centerLed -1) - currPos;\n      }The code also has conditions where the particle can change directions, so we also have to take that into account:if(particleDir) {        if((currPos == NUM_LEDS/2) && oddLeds){\n          currPos = 0;\n        } else if((currPos == NUM_LEDS/2 - 1) && (!oddLeds)){\n          currPos = 0;\n        } else {\n          currPos++;\n        }\n      } else {\n        if((currPos == 0) && oddLeds){\n          currPos = centerLed;\n        } else if((currPos == 0) && (!oddLeds)){\n          currPos = centerLed - 1;\n        } else {\n          currPos--;\n        }\n      }So we use the intended direction (particleDir), to calculate which LED should be lit next, but we also have to consider if we have reached either the real end of the LED string, or our center point, which also acts as an end for each of the virtual strings.Once we've figured all that out, we light up the next light as necessary:if(particleDir) {        if(oddLeds) {\n          Pos1 = centerLed + currPos;\n          Pos2 = centerLed - currPos;\n        } else {\n          Pos1 = centerLed + currPos;\n          Pos2 = (centerLed -1) - currPos;\n        }\n      } else {\n        if(oddLeds) {\n          Pos1 = centerLed - currPos;\n          Pos2 = centerLed + currPos;\n        } else {\n          Pos1 = centerLed - currPos;\n          Pos2 = (centerLed -1) + currPos;\n        }\n      }\n      leds[Pos1] = CHSV(currHue, 255,255);\n      leds[Pos2] = CHSV(currHue, 255,255);           FastLED.show();<br>}Why make this a class at all? As it is, this is pretty straightforward and doesn't really need to be in a class. However I have future plans to update the code to allow for more than one particle to occur at a time, and have some working in reverse while others are going forward.

This was an exciting yet difficult project that spanned over three months. While undertaking this project, I found a lack of a single comprehensive guide on the basics of drone - building. Thus I decided to create this extremely simple guide to explain the fundamentals of drone building to beginners. This is certainly an interesting project to undertake, especially if you are into robotics, physics, and computer science. You don't have to learn about flight physics to make a drone, but if you're a physics nerd (like me) then you may want to, just to understand how the parts work together successfully to create flight. This is also an impressive project you could present to school, use in a robotics competition, or just do for fun.Here are a few videos of my Drone:", "title": "How to Make a Drone - for Dummies", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-a-Drone-for-Beginners/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "1) ToolsWrench - This is used to tighten the propellers onto the motors as well as tighten any and all screws used in the body.Screwdrivers - To tighten screws (duh)Soldering Equipment- This is for electrical connections, such as soldering your ESC's onto your power distribution board (more on this later)Hot Glue Gun - This is used to cover up solder joints and exposed electrical connections to prevent shorting. It can also be used to secure parts of your drone together.2) Tape/ZiptiesThese are basics you'll need to secure parts of the frame and components together3) FrameThis will be the body and arms of your quadcopter. It acts as a mount for electrical components and your FC, and also provides a place to maintain the quad's center of balance. There are plenty of good carbon fiber/metal frames out there, but I decided to build my own frame from aluminum.4) Lithium Polymer BatteryThis will be the power source of your quad. The larger the battery, the more power it will provide, but keep in mind that it will also be heavier. In the end your choice of battery will be a trade-off between flight time and weight.5) Electrical systemYour Power Distribution Board and Electronic Speed Controllers fall under this category; think of it as the nervous system of your drone. The PDB is a small board with 2 conductive rings on its surface. The terminals of your battery will be soldered to the starting points of both rings. Your ESC's will then be soldered to the PDB, with each terminal corresponding to the correct ring. Your ESC's do exactly what the name suggests - they essentially direct the flow of current into your motors to adjust their speed. 6) Brushless MotorsMotors are what provide thrust for your quad. 7) PropellersThese  go on your motors - the curvature of a propeller is such that it pushes air downwards as it spins, creating an equal and opposite force upwards on the drone. Buy plenty of these as they're the most vulnerable part of your quad (you'll break several before your quad becomes stable).8) Flight ControllerThe FC is the 'brain' of your drone. It usually internally contains a compass, accelerometer, and g-sensor. It  takes inputs from your transmitter and outputs signals to your ESC's to get the desired response. Everything from hovering your quad to doing simple turns requires a lot of math specific to your drone - luckily, the FC performs all of these calculations hundreds of times a second.The FC may or may not also require a UBEC - that is, a transformer that steps down the voltage of the battery to a level the FC can handle. Some ESC's come with UBEC's inbuilt, though, so this part depends on your ESC's.9) TX/RXTo give your quad flight instructions, you'll need a transmitter (TX) that has at least 4 channels - for thrust, yaw, pitch, and roll. I recommend using at least six channels to enable flight modes as well. Transmitters come with specific receivers (RX) that receive analogue signals from the TX and transmit them to the FC.10) Ground Control SoftwareThis is the software that will run you through calibrating your FC and allows you to alter certain parameters. You will also use this to plan out autonomous missions and configure additional modules later on.11 Optional StuffThere are plenty of add-ons to a drone you can add once everything is up and running. This guide aims only to instruct on the most basic of components, so I wont explain how any of these things work.

If you look inside a motor, you will see copper coils and neodymium magnets arranged in circles. When currents passes through the coils, a magnetic field is generated, which interacts with the magnetic field of the magnets. When they interact, a magnetic force is exerted on the coils. An equal and opposite force is exerted on the magnets on the outer ring, causing the shaft and casing of the motor to spin rapidly. You can buy motors that rotate at several thousand RPM's, but once again, your motor rating depends on what strength your drone requires. Brushless motors have three connectors, or 'phase leads'; each phase lead is required to control the 3 axes of rotation of your quad: pitch, roll, and yaw. Thrust is controlled directly by the magnitude of current entering the motor.Lithium Polymer BatteryAs mentioned, your choice of battery will be a trade-off between flight time and weight. At a certain point, the increase in weight will become higher than the increase in flight time. Finding out your optimum weight takes experimentation, which we will not explore here. Go here if you want to know more about selecting your battery:http://www.dronetrest.com/t/lipo-batteries-how-to-...To find out how to make a mathematical model to calculate optimum weight, go here:https://oscarliang.com/how-to-choose-battery-for-q...Matching the Components You cannot randomly mix motors, ESC's, and batteries as you like. Your battery will have an 'S' rating - this is the number of cells inside the battery. Your motors will have to synchronize with this; for example, '4S' motors must draw current from a '4S' battery.Furthermore, your ESC's and motors will have to be matched. Motors are labelled with their maximum 'draw current', i.e. the current they will draw at full throttle. Your ESC's must be rated at or higher than the max draw current of your motors. I recommend using a rating a bit higher though, so as not to put strain on your ESC's. A 20A (amp) ESC will work with an 18A motor, but high throttle flying may cause it to heat up and get damaged eventually. Thus a 30A ESC would be better as would have no problem with 18A flowing through it (it can withstand much more).Further furthermore, your battery charger also needs to be right for your battery - for a 3S battery, use only a 3S charger.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FHI/SPZG/IUSLO1Q8/FHISPZGIUSLO1Q8.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Electronics"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Ah, the dreaded FC. There is so much subject material here that it's quite necessary to just absorb as much about how they work and the different types as possible.Most FC's are pretty good at most things, although some are particularly good at certain modes. I went with ArduPilot 2.5 as it's quite robust, and I was already familiar with it. If you've never made an RC vehicle, I would recommend using Ardupilot as it's not too expensive and pretty simple to interface with. If you've flown a bit and want a higher-performance FC for a slightly higher price, I would recommend PixHawk. nevertheless, here is something to help you with your selection:http://myfirstdrone.com/tutorials/buying-guides/be...Your transmitter/receiver set must have 4 channels at the bare minimum. However I highly recommend using 6 or higher, as you will want extra channels later for flight modes. I chose the FlySky i6 as it wasn't too pricey and had a nice interface with an extra flight mode channel. This will probably be the most expensive part of your quad, so choose wisely. Here's some help with that:https://oscarliang.com/choose-rc-transmitter-quadc...Your set will also come with a bind key to bind the Rx and Tx. Here's a video on binding the FlySky i6:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRzvMgoBHdcAnother thing to keep in mind it that your ESC connectors must be connected to your FC in a specific order, not just 1-->1, 2-->2, and so forth. The order may seem random, but please check the order I which your specific FC requires your ESC's to be placed in. Alternatively, you can test each motor independently to check if they rotate in the correct order. Most newbie drone makers think they've done some horrible mistake when they power their quad up for the first time and it flips over violently upon thrust. The reality is that they probably connected the ESC's to the FC in the wrong order. In fact, I wasted about a month with HARPY testing out other random stuff because I thought there was something fundamentally wrong with my setup. in the end, I just had to swap two ESC cables and everything was smooth after that. This is a big problem because no guides seem to address this, leading to situations like mine.

If you've ever flown a ready-made quadcopter before, flying your own drone will be significantly less smooth. This is because it's likely that there are more imperfections in yours; however, your flying can be made smooth with a few simple fixes:TrimmingWhen you first take off, you will notice your quad drifting in one direction or the other. It may also have some yaw. The trims on your transmitter are meant to cancel this out. They are the little silver buttons on your transmitter that beep when you press them. On your display you will see 4 sliders, which will move corresponding with your trims.To view the trims on a typical transmitter, look at the image attached.In general, you should trim to cancel out your quad's drifting - for e.g. if it drifts forwards, press the backward pitch trim button until it stops going forward. Going further will overcompensate, making it drift backwards. It might take a while to find the balance point, but when you do, your drone should hover in space.Throttle GainYou may find your throttle way too responsive, making your drone rush upwards to the sky while you hurriedly cut the throttle and watch it fall down and crash in a mangled heap of metal and wires (never happened to me, I swear). Your throttle trim will adjust your throttle at max thrust. You should aim for full throttle to be a fast rise, and mid to high throttle to give you a steady rise. Flight modesYour FC will come with a variety of flight modes. For our drone (due to limited channels) we used two modes: AltHold and Stabilize mode. Here we will explain some, of many, flight modes.Stabilize modeStabilize mode allows you to fly your vehicle manually, but self-levels the roll and pitch axisMore about Stabilize mode: http://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/stabilize-mode.ht...AltHold (Altitude Hold) modeIn altitude hold mode, the drone maintains a consistent altitude while allowing roll, pitch, and yaw to be controlled normally.More about AltHold mode: http://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/altholdmode.html#...Loiter modeLoiter Mode automatically attempts to maintain the current location, heading and altitude. The pilot may fly the copter in Loiter mode as if it were in a more manual flight mode but when the sticks are released, the vehicle will slow to a stop and hold position.More about Loiter mode: http://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/loiter-mode.html#...Here is a list of many flight modes you can choose from:http://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/flight-modes.htmlPID TuningThis is where the mathematics of your FC comes into play. PID Loops are a set-point variable-based feedback system used in manufacturing industries There is a ton of math here which, unless you're learning control theory in college, you probably don't wanna know about. So let me give you the rundown in Laymen's terms:P-ProportionalThis is the main value which determines the drone's need to stabilize itself. With a low P value, it will correct sluggishly and be relatively unresponsive to controls. If P is too high, your drone will oscillate rapidly by trying to stabilize itself and overshooting repeatedly. You want to tune this first (set I and D to 0) by hovering in a windless environment and increasing P until just before your quad starts oscillating.I-IntegralYour P value determines how much your quad will stabilize. However, this is just the amount by which your drone will correct. The timing is irrelevant to your FC as far as P is concerned; it could stabilize in 1 second or 1 minute. Your I value exists to speed things up - it dictates the force exerted to push the quad back into a stable position. This is why I is important in outdoor flying; with factors like wind, your I is what controls how quickly your drone will respond to outside factors. Use a low I, and your quad will just drift away in the wind.D-DerivativeThis one is the least important; some FC's don't even let you change this so as not to mess with the PID loops too much. Think of D like a dampener; it smoothens out the corrections made by P and I. Instead of jerking back to a hovering position, a drone with a high D value will gracefully return horizontal after getting to its new position.Here's another super-simple guide to PID tuning: https://oscarliang.com/quadcopter-pid-explained-tu...Here's a slightly more hardcore version:https://oscarliang.com/understanding-pid-for-quadc...For an even more detailed version, go here:http://myfirstdrone.com/tutorials/how-to-tune-a-qu...If you're interested in the math behind PID-loop theory and have Alan Turing's brain, go here:http://innovativecontrols.com/blog/basics-tuning-p...http://www.expertune.com/tutor.aspxFinally, for a cool analogy to help you understand all of this a bit better, go here:http://diydrones.com/forum/topics/pid-explained", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F9E/UVXN/IUSLPFGT/F9EUVXNIUSLPFGT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3P/DMBV/IUSLQ87E/F3PDMBVIUSLQ87E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIO/3FHR/IUSLQ87H/FIO3FHRIUSLQ87H.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Flight"}], "channel": "Gadgets"}, {"category": "technology", "description": "Quadrotors are the new Segways: a mesmerizing, somewhat magical, self-stabilizing platform that every tech person wants to have. You can't ride a quadrotor (well, maybe you can), but they do fly, and you can build one yourself from scratch!\nI helped with a previous quadrotor build (Instructable here), and after flying it I decided I wanted to make my own. I had an idea to make a miniature one comprising a single printed circuit board that is both its structural frame and its electronics motherboard. The end result was \"4pcb\", a 138-gram micro quadrotor. I designed it in EAGLE, soldered it, and tested it over the course of a few months. Here's some video of it flying, after a lot of control tuning (see Step 13) and practice:\nMore flight video in the final Step!\nThe idea of making a PCB-based quadrotor isn't unique (see links below for other examples), and 4pcb definitely isn't the smallest (see the Picopter Instructable for a really tiny one). But I think it strikes a good balance between size, cost, buildability, and flyability. It's also one of the only PCB quadrotors with integrated brushless motor drivers, so there's no need to wire up external ESCs. And it runs on XBee digital radios, so there's no RC receiver or servo-style wiring.4pcb Specifications:\nSize: 6.50\" (165mm) motor center-to-center distance, diagonally\nBattery: 3S (11.1V), 370mAh, 20-40C Lithium Polymer\nMotors: HXM1400-2000 \"hexTronik 5gram Brushless Outrunner 2000kv\"\nESCs: Toshiba TB6588FG\u00a0\"3-Phase Full-Wave PWM Driver for Sensorless DC Motors\"\nProps: 4x2.5 (2), 4x2.5R (2)\nController: Arduino Pro Mini 328 - 5V/16MHz\nIMU: Pololu MinIMU-9\nRadio: XBee Series 1\nTotal Weight: 138g\nAdditional Payload: <30g\nFlight Time @138g: 8min\n4pcb is a \"low level\" quadrotor build, by which I mean that there are very few black box components.

Depending on your level of experience and interest, you may want to take a different approach where you buy commercial modules for some parts and DIY others. (I included links to some kits and modules below.) This Instructable includes all the files and information you would need to build one completely from scratch.\nThere are a few small changes I would make if I did a second version of the board, but overall, I think it could make a good standalone project or, even better, a great starting point for your own modifications!

You can download it here. The free \"Light Edition\" is sufficient, even though the outline of the board is larger than 100x80mm limit (see Step 2). You will also need EAGLE to reference the board layout when placing components. (e.g. Type \"show R32\" in the board window command line to figure out where to put resistor R32.) There are no designators on the board itself.-Arduino\nThe flight controller is written in the Arduino IDE. You can download the latest version from here.

If you just want to run the ground station executable, you can download the .NET Framework runtime files from here.-Processing? (Optional)\nAlthough I haven't done so myself, it is possible to port the ground station software over to Processing, which would make it compatible with other operating systems.

The second most time-consuming part of the project was probably designing the board in EAGLE. (The most time consuming part is programming the flight controller and tweaking the controls.) I included the Gerber files required to manufacture an exact copy of 4pcb's PCB in the project documentation files (Step 1). In that case, you can skip to the next Step, which talks about board manufacturing options. But, I strongly encourage anyone who is interested in modifying the board design to pop open the EAGLE files and go for it!How to Cheat EAGLE Light's Board Size Limit (A Little):\n4pcb is quite a bit larger than the 100x80mm board size limit for the free EAGLE Light Edition. One reason I put off starting this project was because I didn't want to pay for the full version or switch to a different board layout software. But then I discovered something interesting: The board size limit applies only the placement of components. You can route traces, add holes, and create a board outline that extend far outside the 100x80mm box.\n4pcb's centroid is right at the middle of the 100x80mm bounding box. All the components fit in the center part of the board, inside this restricted area. The arms, including the motor mounting holes, stretch out in all directions including going into negative coordinates. This is fine - the Gerber files still seem to render properly.Board Outline:\n4pcb's board outline (\"Dimension\" layer in EAGLE) is actually the shape of the quadrotor frame. Most board printing companies will route the outside dimension of your board to any shape you specify. (Make sure this is an option before you order.) Drawing the shape took some practice using the arc tools in EAGLE. One idea that's been suggested is to add diagonal supports between the arms. However, this would create areas of internal routing, and most board companies charge extra for that.Rotational Symmetry and Copy-Paste:\nThe four motor controller blocks are rotationally symmetric. I routed this board in EAGLE 5.11, when Copy-Paste of component groups was more difficult. I think it's much more straightforward in EAGLE 6.0.0 and later. But it definitely still saved a lot of routing time to be able to make four identical copies of the motor controller block. If you're using an older version of EAGLE (prior to 6.0.0), the rough process for Copy-Paste is as follows:\n1. Create and route the component block to be copied. Do this first, before any non-copied components are placed or routed. This will help auto-numbering not break.\n2. Close the schematic. This breaks the back-annotation check so that you can Copy-Paste on the board itself.\n3. Select the group and perform a group copy (Ctrl + Right Click). Paste, move, and rotate as desired.\n4. Re-open the schematic. Ignore all the errors. Copy-paste the schematic group containing exactly\u00a0the same components and nets as the board group.\n5. The auto-numbering should work, but if it doesn't you may have to clean up some designators manually to make them match the board copy.\n6. Repeat.\nThe process should be much simpler in EAGLE 6.0 or later, and shouldn't require breaking the back-annotation.

The external wiring is summarized in 4pcb_EXT.pdf in the project documentation (Step 1).Pololu minIMU-9 Mounting and Wiring:\nThis quadrotor's original design called for the now-obselete Sparkfun 6DOF Razor IMU. The new design uses the Pololu minIMU-9. The minIMU-9 is a digital IMU, which has some nice benefits (higher resolution ADC than the Arduino, self-zeroing). It's also smaller than the Razor IMU was and only requires four connections to communicate with the Arduino Pro Mini over I2C serial.\nI didn't modify the board to have a minIMU footprint because I found that the IMU has to be mounted on foam tape anyway in order to minimize the effects of mechanical vibration transmitted through the frame. (The vibration really messes with the gyros, in ways that can't even be filtered out.) I found that making a loop of foam tape works even better than one or two layers alone. Also, I found that adding mass to the IMU, by taping small pieces of aluminum to the bottom, helped. (See the third image.)\nAfter mounting the IMU to the frame, the four connections should be made with thin, flexible external wires (also to minimize vibration). Conveniently, the connectors can go right to the first four pins of the now-unused Sparkfun IMU header. (See first image.)External Power Wiring:\nThe power wiring carries high current, so I thought it would be a good idea to keep it off-board. In retrospect, I wish I had put the external power wiring on the board. This is something I would definitely modify in v2. There is enough room to route a few large traces around to carry power and ground to the four motor controllers, especially with the Sparkfun IMU headers out of the way.\nFor now, though, the power wiring is done externally with 22AWG or larger, preferably stranded wire. There are a total of 8 wire jumps to make, four for power and four for ground. (See the second image.)

However, the minimum voltage rating of the Toshiba TB6588FG driver chip is 7V, which is cutting it a little close for 2S. I found that a 3S (11.1V) battery, even one that it slightly heavier than the 2S, increased flight time and didn't cause the motors to overheat.\nThe 10g version\u00a0and 20g version of this motor fit the same mounting pattern and can swing a much larger propeller, so it might be possible to make a larger version just by extending the arms.

I originally tried plastic ones, but they broke off on tough landings. The aluminum ones are much more durable, for not very much weight penalty. They attach directly to the outermost motor mounting screw (use threadlocker). To cushion the landings, I added four small silicone feet to the landing gear. Without these, the shock from the landings is transmitted directly into the motor, which can sometimes case its rotor press fit to fail (see below).Shock-Proofing the Motors:\nBy far the most common failure mode I found during crash landings was the motor cans coming apart. (See the second image.) The shock from a crash would cause the narrow interference fit to fail, and no amount of superglue or Loctite would keep it together. The problem with adhesives like that is that the joint is brittle, so the shock just cracks the adhesive off.\nI found a much better solution was to actually heat shrink the entire motor. You can see this in the first image: three of the four motors are heat-shrinked. This probably reduces motor cooling a bit, but the compliant heat shrink does a much better job of holding the rotor together under the shock loads of a crash landing. Just be careful to cut and shrink the tubing evenly, or it will throw off the balance of the rotor a lot.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FBI/LT72/H2ULR3CX/FBILT72H2ULR3CX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKU/QLI1/H2ULR3FV/FKUQLI1H2ULR3FV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Landing Gear and Motor Shock Proofing"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "\n          4pcb uses four 4x2.5 propellers, two standard and two counter-rotating. (It needs the counter-rotating props to control the yaw.) You can buy them in sets of six here. Buy plenty of spares.\nThe props are inexpensive, but they're also poorly balanced. Other than mounting the IMU on foam tape, balancing the props was the single most important thing I did to reduce vibrations. You can feel the effect of vibrations on the frame, but to really see how large they are I filmed one arm of the quadrotor under a strobe light set to flash slightly faster or slightly slower than the prop speed:\n\tIf that doesn't convince you of the importance of balancing the props, I don't know what will.\u00a0You can buy prop balancing jigs, but I think they're mostly useless for small props and I wouldn't waste the money.For a rough pass at balancing the props, you can place them on any small, smooth shaft and see which way they tend to fall. If they get \"stuck\", tap the shaft a little or spin the prop with your fingers. If they have a tendency to fall one way, add small pieces of electrical tape to the opposite side until they seem to have no preference. I use yellow electrical tape to add some visibility to the edges of the props as well.For more precise balancing,\u00a0you can use a 2mm shaft and two prop adapters to make a simple gravity-based balancing jig like the one shown in the first image. The bubble levels are optional - a machine vise or any other reasonably flat and smooth surfaces could be used instead.\u00a0I found this to be far more precise than commercial jigs.\nFor some reason, the counter-rotating props (4x2.5R) always seem to require more balancing. I've sometimes even had to use two layers of tape!Prop Adapters and Prop Savers:\nThe motors come with prop adapters, small hubs that reduce the bore of the prop down to 2mm so it is a nice fit on the motor shaft. They also come with prop savers, which are just o-rings. The prop savers are designed to absorb the impact of a prop strike, where the propeller hits the ground or a fixed object. This way, the propeller itself is less likely to break. They work fairly well on small props. I've crashed many times and only break a prop maybe 1 out of 10 crashes.\nThe second image shows how the prop adapter and prop saver are used to mount the propeller to the motor.

Normally, this would take the form of a prepackaged RC-style ESC, but for this quad I especially wanted to integrate the motor controllers onto the PCB itself. Luckily, after searching around for a while, I found the Toshiba TB6588FG driver chips, which were perfect for the job.\nWell...almost perfect.Overclocking the TB6588FG:\nThe TB6588FG has a variety of options that can be \"programmed\" simply by placing resistors to pull pins up or down. One such option is a fault protection which disables the motor if a maximum commutation frequency is exceeded. The maximum frequency is the chip's internal clock frequency divided by 3*2^11. On the default clock speed of 5MHz, this is 814Hz. The datasheet, which is a little sparse, neglects to mention what happens if you ignore the fault and keep telling the motor to speed up. As it turns out, the driver will keep increasing the drive voltage while holding the frequency at 814Hz, causing the motor to draw a lot of current without producing any more power.\nUnfortunately, the HXM1400-2000 motors can get up to significantly higher frequencies. At 2,000rpm/V and 11.1V, the no-load speed is 22,200rpm, or 367Hz. But the motor has 14 poles, so the no-load frequency is 7*367rps = 2,590Hz. The loaded speed, with a propeller, is much lower than this, but still higher than 800Hz.\nLuckily, the datasheet also neglects to mention why the clock speed is 5MHz; it's just the default setting used in all the examples. The clock speed is set by a resistor and capacitor which form the time basis of an oscillator. I halved the value of the resistor, to 10k (R9, R27, R46, and R65), pushing the clock to 10MHz and the maximum commutation frequency to 1,628Hz. This seems to be enough to cover the range of loaded speeds for the HXM1400-2000 on 11.1V. I'm guessing the clock frequency can go even higher, but haven't tested it.\u00a0As a side effect of the clock frequency doubling, the PWM frequency also doubled. This can increase switching losses, but I opted for the lowest of the possible PWM frequency settings to compensate for this.Analog Inputs\nAnother nice thing about the TB6588FG motor driver chips is that they take analog inputs to command motor voltage, rather than the servo-style PWM inputs of commercial brushless ESCs. Servo PWMs have a refresh rate of 20ms by default, which is a little on the slow side for a small quadrotor like this. Analog inputs can be arbitrarily fast (up to the sampling rate inside the TB6588FG).\nTo generate the analog signals, I use the Arduino's PWM capabilities, but at very high frequency. (62.5kHz if I got the settings correct.) Then, I filter the PWMs with a first-order RC filter (third image). The filter time constant is:tau = 3k\u03a9 * 0.1\u03bcF = 0.3ms.\nThe cutoff frequency is:f_c = 1 / (2 * pi * tau) = 531Hz.\nThis is fast enough to capture transient speed commands, but slow enough to filter out most of the PWM ripple.\nOverall, the TB6588FG is a pretty amazing little chip. It can drive each of the motors with up to 3A, and can even reverse them using a digital input. This can be convenient in case you solder the motor wires on in the wrong order. You might even be able to fly upside down, although I haven't gotten this to work yet.

This Step focuses on how to get from those four commands (the inputs) to the four motor speeds (the outputs).\nYou might be able to look at the image in the previous Step and intuitively figure out what the input/output mapping for a quadrotor should be.

Yaw works on a different principle, using reaction torque from the motor to rotate the frame. The reaction torque for each motor is in the opposite direction as the propeller and is proportional to the drag seen by the propeller as it pushes through the air.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FL1/3Y9A/H2TIUBHI/FL13Y9AH2TIUBHI.LARGE.gif"], "step_title": "Step 12: Command Matrix"}, {"step": 13, "steps_text": "In an ideal world, you could just take the four inputs (throttle, pitch, roll, yaw) and directly map them to the four motor outputs using the command matrix from the previous step. But there are some things which make it impractical to do this in real life:\n1. Disturbances such as wind and non-idealities such as differences in the motors and propellers cause the real-life dynamics to be noisy and variable. Direct command mapping doesn't take these into account, and our mind, eyes, and hands might not be fast enough to react to these in real time, especially on a small quadrotor.\n2. We want the quadrotor to have some degree of \"autonomy\". Particularly, it would be nice if the quadrotor could self-level, returning to nearly horizontal when we command zero pitch, roll, and yaw. With direct mapping, we are commanding the quadrotor to rotate but it won't know to return to horizontal when we're done.\nThis is where\u00a0feedback control\u00a0comes in. Despite its complex mathematical notations, the concept of feedback control is simple. Imagine washing your hands in a sink you've never used before. You set the faucet knob to some middle position. If the water's too cold, you turn it up. If the water's too warm, you turn it down. How much you turn it up or down depends on how hot or cold it is compared to your liking. If the water starts cold, but then rapidly heats up, you may preemptively turn the knob back down to prevent it from overshooting and burning your hands. All these concepts are mathematically formalized in feedback control.\u00a0Feedback Control on a Quadrotor:\nA common structure for feedback control is called PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control. The thing to be controlled in this case is the angle (pitch, roll, or yaw angle) of the quadrotor. This is analogous to the temperature of the water in the sink. With no input commands, we try to control the angle to be zero. However, we can also command a non-zero angle to make the quadrotor move. The commands we send to the motors are based on the error between the angle we want and the angle we actually have, as measured by the IMU.\n- Proportional (P):\u00a0The command is proportional to how much angular error we have. It helps return the quadrotor to zero angle, or push it to whatever angle you command.- Integral (I):\u00a0The command is proportional to the accumulated error over time. It can help fight disturbances like wind or asymmetric motor performance.\u00a0I don't use this on my quad, although I left placeholder code for it in the Arduino project.\n-\u00a0Derivative (D): The command is proportional to the rate of change of the error*. It resists motion and it keeps the angle from overshooting the target.Mass-Spring-Damper Analogy:\nThe effects of PD control (no integral term) on a quadrotor are similar to adding a virtual spring and virtual damper (shock absorber) to the quadrotor, which is the mass. See the first image for a graphical depiction of this. The spring stiffness is set by a constant, Kp, the \"proportional gain\". The damping rate is set by another constant,\u00a0Kd, the \"derivative gain\". The desired angle,\u00a0\u03b8r, defines the angle at which the springs are evenly stretched. Imagine attaching the springs to a movable plank, and rotating the plank to command the quadrotor to go to a certain angle.\n- Increasing\u00a0Kp\u00a0pushes the quadrotor toward the reference angle faster, but can also result in more overshoot and oscillation.\n- Increasing Kd\u00a0slows down the rotation rate of the quadrotor, but can also damp out oscillations.\nNote that the gains can be increased to a point where this model breaks down. If\u00a0Kp, Kd, or both are too high, the controller will start amplifying noise, leading to oscillations and instability. These oscillations tend to be at a faster frequency than the oscillations that would be seen from a high Kp:Kd ratio. If you see fast oscillations, the best thing to do is turn both gains down.\nTuning the gains takes practice and experience, and depends on your exact frame and flying preference. A really good guide to PID tuning for multirotors, with video example to show the various types of oscillations, can be found here. Hopefully, the spring/damper analogy helps you think about the gains intuitively.\n*Actually, in practice it is sometimes easier to use the measured rate of rotation directly, instead of trying to measure the rate of change of the error. The error only exists in software and computing the derivative of it can be noisy. Practically speaking, using the measured rate of rotation directly from the gyro works just fine. To map this into the mass-spring-damper analogy, the dampers are connected to ground (zero angle) instead of to the plank. In this configuration, they resist all rotation, even commanded rotation.Pitch, Roll, and Yaw Controllers:\nThe quadrotor actually has three independent feedback controllers, one each for pitch, roll, and yaw. Throttle is directly mapped to all four motors with no feedback control in this quadrotor. With an altitude sensor, a fourth feedback controller could be added.\nThe\u00a0pitch\u00a0and\u00a0roll\u00a0controllers are PD controllers that match up exactly with the first image. To the extent that the quadrotor is symmetric, the pitch and roll gains should be the same. The outputs from the proportional and the derivative gains are summed together and sent to the motors through the command matrix in the previous Step. The second image shows the pitch and roll PD controllers in block diagram form. The variables are:Kp - Proportional GainKd - Derivative Gain\u03b8r - Reference/Command Angle\u03b8 - Measured Angle from the IMU\u03a9 - Measured Rate of Rotation from the IMU.y - The output command.\nThe yaw\u00a0controller is only based on rate, so it doesn't exactly match the images. The error is just the difference between the commanded yaw rate and the measured yaw rate from the IMU. The magnetometer in the IMU could be used to measure absolute yaw angle to implement a full PD controller, but I haven't tried this yet.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5H/218E/H2TIUBI5/F5H218EH2TIUBI5.LARGE.gif", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKV/LLFR/H2TIBBTR/FKVLLFRH2TIBBTR.LARGE.gif"], "step_title": "Step 13: Feedback Control"}, {"step": 14, "steps_text": "Feedback control is only useful if there is a quality measurement signal to feed back. In the case of a quadrotor, it's critical to have an accurate measurement of both angle and angular rate. This requires two different types of sensors. Sound familiar? I wasn't joking when I said that quadrotors are the new Segway. In fact, they're more like two flying Segways, one for pitch and one for roll. Each axis has its own accelerometer and gyro measurement, and the way the signal from these two sensors can be combined is identical to what I used in the Seg...stick Instructable and in this white paper. Before looking at the Complementary Filter, though, it's important to understand what each of the sensors does:The Accelerometer:\nThe accelerometer actually doesn't measure acceleration. It measures force per unit mass along each axis. You can use this measurement to determine the direction of gravity, which exerts a force downward, as long as the quadrotor isn't accelerating.\nThe Polulu minIMU-9 is a lot less hassle than the original analog sensor because it is self-zeroing and reports a digital value with a known scaling factor. The scaling factor is even a nice simple number: 1mg/digit with the most sensitive range.\u00a0That is, 1/1000th the acceleration due to gravity per digit. I got this value directly from the accelerometer datasheet.\u00a0If you point the sensor's X axis directly downward, it should report back a value of 1,000.\nConverting from an acceleration measurement to an angle requires either a lot of trigonometry or a linearization. Since the quadrotor spends most of it's time horizontally and deviates by at most 30\u00ba in any direction, I chose the linearization. The first image shows how to linearize about 0\u00ba. The slope of the line that is tangent to the sensor output vs. angle curve at 0\u00ba is\u00a01000digit/rad. The inverse is what is called A_GAIN in the code:A_GAIN = 0.001rad/digit = 0.0573\u00ba/digit.\nThis is the number by which to multiply the raw accelerometer value to get an approximate angle in degrees.The Gyro:\nThe gyroscope isn't actually a gyroscope; there are no spinning flywheels inside the chip. It's more accurately called an angular rate sensor, and uses a MEMS tuning fork structure to measure rate of rotation based on Coriolis force. Like the accelerometer, there's one for each axis.\nSince this is a nice digital IMU, the value reported is directly in physical units, although the scaling factor is a bit odd. It's given in the datasheet for the gyro as 8.75mdps/digit, or 0.00875(\u00ba/s)/digit. I use this value directly as G_GAIN in the code.G_GAIN = 0.00875(\u00ba/s)/digit.\nThis is the number by which to multiply the raw gyro value to get an angular rate in degrees per second.Motivation for Merging Sensors to Estimate Angle:\nThe gyro directly measures angular rate, so the rate feedback is taken care of by the gyros alone. In fact it should be possible to fly the quadrotor on rate feedback only, but it would need a different control structure and wouldn't self-level. To get good attitude control, angle feedback is also required.\nUnfortunately, the accelerometer estimate of angle isn't perfect. Horizontal acceleration will disturb the angle estimate, since the accelerometer can't distinguish the difference between accelerating forward and leaning backwards. The quadrotor doesn't spend much time accelerating horizontally, but when it does, it can easily pull large fractions of 1g, which will disturb the angle estimate substantially.\nThe gyro can also produce an angle estimate, by numeric integration: If you know how fast you're rotating, you can predict what angle you'll be at in the next time step by multiplying the rate by the sample time. This estimate of angle can work for short periods of time, but over long a duration it will drift away from the true angle. No matter how good and well-zeroed the gyro is, numeric integration will always cause the angle estimate produced by the gyro alone to drift over time.\nSo, the accelerometer is bad for short-term angle estimate, but provides a stable long-term average equal to the gravity vector. The gyro is good for short-term angle estimates, but will drift over long periods of time. The Complementary Filter, discussed in the next Step, merges the sensors together smoothly at different time scales to obtain a better angle estimate than either sensor alone could produce.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F1B/M3QM/H2TJ4TMR/F1BM3QMH2TJ4TMR.LARGE.gif"], "step_title": "Step 14: IMU Part 1: Sensors"}, {"step": 15, "steps_text": "My method of choice for combining the accelerometer and gyro signals into a clean and stable angle estimate is the Complementary Filter. It's computationally efficient and it directly addresses both transient horizontal acceleration and long-term gyro drift. The idea is to use the gyro for short term angle estimates, by numeric integration, but switch to the accelerometer for long-term estimates, by averaging. To do this in a continuous way, low-pass and high-pass filters are used. This is identical to the method I used in the Seg...stick Instructable, Step 10.\nThe image shows the a Complementary Filter in block diagram form. The sensor signals, converted to degrees and degrees per second, are the inputs. The accelerometer angle is low-pass filtered, reducing the influence of short-duration signals but maintaining a long-term average (from gravity). \u00a0The gyro angular rate is first integrated, to get an estimate of angle, and then high-pass filtered, to remove any long-term drift. The two filtered signals are summed together to create a single angle estimate that combines the best parts of both sensor signals.\nIt's one of the few cases where the code is more concise than the block diagram or the written explanation:\n\u00a0 //\u00a0Excerpt\u00a0from pd_digitalIMU.pde in 4pcb_ARD:\n\u00a0 // -------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u00a0 rate_pitch = (float) g_pitch * G_GAIN;\n\u00a0 angle_pitch = AA * (angle_pitch + rate_pitch * DT);\n\u00a0 angle_pitch += (1.0 - AA) * (float) a_pitch * A_GAIN;\n\u00a0 // -------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe first line converts the raw gyro signal, g_pitch, into \u00ba/s, as discussed in the previous Step. The end of the second line is the numeric integration. DT is the loop time, 0.01s. A small change in angle, rate_pitch * DT, is added to the previous angle estimate.\nThe rest of the second line and all of the third line form the high-pass and low-pass filters, in discrete form. The high-pass acts on the integrated angle estimate and the low-pass acts on the accelerometer signal, a_pitch. The constant AA determines the time scale of the high- and low-pass filters, and is a value you can tweak depending on your quadrotor. Larger AA trusts the integrated gyro signal for longer. Shorter AA merges the accelerometer signal in faster.\nThe value for AA used in 4pcb corresponds with a time constant of 1s. This is the approximate length of time for which the gyro angle estimate is trusted, and the approximate length of time over which the accerometer signal is averaged. Since these are infinite impulse-response (IIR) filters, the transition is smooth and continuous and the time constant only represents where the weighting of the two filters is equal.\nI wrote up a more thorough explanation of the Complementary Filter as applied to self-balancing system in this white paper.

The commands sent to the motor are not thrust values, though. They represent a voltage, or more precisely a fraction of the battery voltage, applied at the motor terminals. The voltage and speed of the motor are closely related, which is why motor controllers are often called speed controllers. But thrust is more closely related to the\u00a0square\u00a0of propeller speed. (Just like lift is proportional to airspeed squared.)\nSince the quadrotor spends most of its time operating in a small band of speeds around hover, the difference may not matter very much. But, I played with the idea of \"undoing\" the square relationship by passing the motor commands through a square root function before sending them to the motors. The square root function has to be normalized (see the image), but it can be done with a look-up table to spare the CPU time.\nI found that this modification did improve stability, especially for manually holding altitude.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FI5/0QGW/H2TIL75I/FI50QGWH2TIL75I.LARGE.gif"], "step_title": "Step 17: A Minor Tweak: Square-Root Control Law"}, {"step": 18, "steps_text": "4pcb's radio interface is based on XBee Series 1 modules. These are small 2.4GHz digital radio modules that behave like wireless serial ports. In the Bill of Materials, I specified two of the higher-power XBee Pro transceivers. At $32, these are about 50% more expensive than the normal XBee modules. But they will give you much longer radio range, which is important for a quadrotor.\nOne XBee connects directly to the quadrotor, on the bottom of the board. (I superglued mine in, so it doesn't fall out during hard landings.) The other connects to a ground station computer using an XBee-to-USB adapter such as the Sparkfun XBee Explorer. One advantage XBee radios have over standard RC equipment is that the data flows both ways. Commands are sent from the ground station to the quadrotor, and telemetry is sent back.\nData is sent in packets, one byte at a time, at 57600 bits per second. I chose this bit rate because it's also the default rate for the Arduino bootloader, so you can program the Arduino Pro Mini over XBee without needing a separate programming cable. (You still have to hit reset on the Pro Mini.) The second image shows the flow of data and the byte definitions of the command and telemetry packets. The third image shows how to recover the angle and angular rates in degress (per second) from the raw telemetry data.\nThe quadrotor transmits and reads data at 100Hz.

It consists of three parts: a user input device, an XBee radio as discussed in the previous step, and some software to map input device axes to commands.Input Device: Logitiech Gamepad\nI chose to use a Logitech Dual Action gamepad as my input device. The first image shows how the Logitech gamepad's joystick axes get mapped to the four quadrotor commands. Experienced RC pilots might recognize this joystick layout as Mode 2. Unlike an RC radio, the throttle stick on the gamepad will be spring loaded. This makes it a little more difficult to hold altitude, but it's not too hard to get used to.\nYou can use any other USB HID device as the controller, but you'll have to modify the ground station software to correctly map the joystick axes to the commands. I've also tried a flight simulator joystick. I didn't like the feel as much, but this was back when I was first learning how to fly it.\nYou can also use a standard RC flight transmitter. In this case, you don't even need a computer for interfacing. An Arduino can read the pulse position modulation (PPM) signals from the transmitter's trainer port, and send out commands via XBee. Here's a guide on how to map signals from the transmitter's trainer port to the XBee.Interfacing Software:\nIf you do decide to use a USB HID controller, you'll need some software running on a computer to interface with the controller and to send commands to the XBee radio. This software can also grab telemetry from the quadrotor and display it, or log it for later analysis.\nI wrote a simple ground station program in Visual Basic, which is included in the project documentation (Step 1). The executable is in the 4pcb_EXE folder and the source is in the 4pcb_VB folder. To run the executable, you'll need the .NET Framework runtime files, which can be downloaded from here. If you're interested in modifying the ground station software, you can use Visual Basic 2010 Express, which is free.\nMy ground station is nowhere near as functional as it could be. First, only some of the trims are active and they don't save their values when you close the program. It also only logs the telemetry (in a text file called 4pcbdata.txt). It could do so much more - like display a virtual 3D quadrotor on the screen that mimics the orientation of the real quadrotor.\nThe .NET-based ground station will only run in Windows. If you're on a different OS, you can still write ground station software in any programming language that can interface to HID game controllers and a virtual serial port (so, pretty much any language). One easy option is Processing, an application/GUI programming language with and Arduino-like IDE. There is a third-party library for Procssing called ProCONROLL which interfaces to HID controllers. I wrote a very quick Processing/ProCONTROLL-based ground station for controlling robots\u00a0that could easily be modified to send the command packet needed for the quadrotor.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5G/6F69/H2ULR6OE/F5G6F69H2ULR6OE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPB/P3UL/H2TIFZQV/FPBP3ULH2TIFZQV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHT/DEEW/H2ULR7X0/FHTDEEWH2ULR7X0.LARGE.gif"], "step_title": "Step 19: Ground Station"}, {"step": 20, "steps_text": "\n          This isn't the type of quadrotor that can fly itself.

Please note, however, that this is a huge, complex topic, with hundreds of websites dedicated to explaining it. I'll attempt to condense as much of this as possible into one Instructable that I'll maintain to the best of my ability.Before I continue, let me state now that this hobby is both expensive and time consuming. Don't let this deter you, but in all fairness, be warned that you may wind up dropping $700+ and many, many hours on this.So what is drone racing?Drone racing is a recently created sport where pilots fly FPV, or first person view, drones at speeds that can exceed 100 mph (If you needed to ask). Reaction times and technology are pushed to the limit as pilots weave through gates, tunnels, and between poles, while VR-like goggles let them see exactly what the drone sees. (Notable pilots: BanniUK, Nurk, Gab707, Wild Willy)OK cool, so then what's freestyle?Drone freestyle is a more relaxed, free way of flying, with no rules or boundaries imposed. Pilots \"float\" upside down in free fall, shoot narrow gaps, \"wallride\" vertical walls or trees, and perform flips, loops, rolls, and other maneuvers in smooth combos. Freestyle emphasizes the freedom of flight, as opposed to the human and technological limitations. (Notable pilots: Mr. Steele, Skitzo, StingerSwarm, Le Drib, Charpu)So now that it's defined, where in the world do I start?Hopefully, you'll know by the end, or at least halfway through. There are simulators, toy drones, simple FPV racing drones, high end FPV racing drones, and finally the custom build. My main focus will be on the custom build, as it's both the most difficult and most interesting part of the hobby, and will give you far better performance in the long run. I'll try to work through these in a logical order, please bear in mind that this is still a work in progress. **Disclaimer** None of the links included are affiliate links.

The easiest and cheapest way to start is with FPV Freerider (available here) which includes a free demo, or for $5 you can pick up the whole package. Other alternatives include Liftoff and the DRL simulator, but both of these are more advanced, and will be more difficult to learn on. These simulators will help you learn the basics of controlling the drone, and how to coordinate maneuvers. For the sake of this Instructable, I'll go with FPV Freerider as the demo simulator. You'll need at minimum a gamepad with two joysticks (Keyboard control is supported but nearly unflyable), but if you do have a RC radio with two gimbals and a USB cable, that'll work better.The basics of flightGenerally quadcopters (or quads) are flown in a Mode 2 configuration. This means that throttle is assigned to the left stick's vertical, or Y axis, Yaw is assigned to the left stick's horizontal X axis, Pitch is assigned to the right stick's vertical Y axis, and Roll is assigned to the right stick's horizontal X axis.There are two primary flight modes as well, self-level or horizon mode, and rate, or acro mode. Horizon mode returns the quad to a level position when the pitch/roll stick is released. Acro mode does not level itself, instead maintaining it's current angle when the pitch/roll stick is released. It's generally best to learn on horizon mode until you get a feel for controlling it, then switching to rate once you're comfortable. FPV Freerider also includes a rate switch, allowing you to determine the sensitivity of the input.Coordinated turnsAfter playing around with the simulator, you may notice that turning at speed is difficult. To fix this, combine roll and yaw in equal amounts to complete a banked turn, maintaining your speed and angle forwards. It may help to think of the quad as a thrust vector in a newtonian environment with very little air resistance: you need to cancel out your existing velocity in one direction, then accelerate in the desired direction (Think vector addition).Getting funky!Once you feel mostly confident with flying and turning and whatnot, try adding in some flips, loops and rolls (You'll need to be in acro mode for this to work). Remember that you'll want to zero the throttle any time you are upside down, otherwise you'll be accelerating downwards. Mess around with it, crash lots, just have fun! There's some neat structures on the map to play around with, just try things.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FVG/XVJZ/J5MQKBYT/FVGXVJZJ5MQKBYT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9S/LWWK/J6MGCJGW/F9SLWWKJ6MGCJGW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Starting With a Simulator"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Regardless of how psyched you are about drones, few people want to go drop $750+ on a racing drone right away. A cheap toy quad is an excellent place to start practicing your skills with a real quad without investing too much time or money. Personally I love the FQ777; it's small, charges quickly, is nearly indestructible, and is its own carrying case, so you can throw it in a bag and take it anywhere. Again, really just have fun with it, flying Line of Sight (or LOS) is hard, and trying to keep track of it's orientation can be difficult. With most small toy quads, flying indoors is probably recommended, outdoors the wind and gusts can play havoc with a less powerful drone. Practice on the simulator will still help, a lot of work is done just building muscle memory and coordination.Once you're comfortable, I would recommend looking into a \"real\" racing drone setup: there's a lot of options. I know I'm not able to cover everything here, but hopefully it's a pointer in the right direction.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FLP/JQZZ/J5MQT7JO/FLPJQZZJ5MQT7JO.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Starting Cheap"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "There's really no simple answer. Your budget is the main determining factor at this point. You'll also have to consider whether you want to fly LOS (line of sight) or FPV. FPV is more expensive, but allows far greater freedom in the air. There are a huge and growing number of ready to fly (RTF) setups on the market, as well as bind and fly (BNF) which requires you to have your own radio (and goggles for FPV), and almost ready to fly (ARF) which require you to have your own radio, goggles, and flight controller board. Nearly every major RC distributor, such as HobbyKing, GetFPV, and HeliPal have their own line(s) of pre-setup racing/freestyle drones.Another factor to take into consideration is the size. A typical FPV racer is built to accept 5\" or 6\" propellers, and generally measures between 220mm to 250mm measured from rotor to rotor. However, recently smaller 3\" and 4\" racing drones have become more popular, as advances in the technology allow them to have the same features as larger drones, but in a lighter, cheaper, and more agile (although slower) package. At the higher end of the prebuilt racer spectrum are drones such as the ImmersionRC Vortex 250 and the TBS Vendetta. These offer high end racer specs, albeit at a premium price. The task of picking out a drone, radio transmitter, and FPV gear can be super daunting and intimidating. I personally started with an Eachine 250 Racer, a drone I would not recommend due to a history of electrical issues. However, it did give me the radio transmitter and an FPV screen, both of which I still use.Again, there's no one answer. The more common radio systems are Spektrum and Taranis, but nearly any RC radio system with 6+ channels can be used. One in particular you may want to consider is the new Taranis QX7, due to it's low price point and number of features. As far as FPV equipment goes, goggles are the best choice as they provide the most immersion and block out sun glare and distracting surroundings. The most commonly used system is the Fatshark FPV system which provides slim, compact goggles with high resolution display, but again at a premium. Personally, I've found the Eachine EV800 to be an excellent set, with a wide display that fills your field of view at a reasonable resolution.Finally, when it comes down to the drone itself, it's what you feel comfortable with. Building your own is not as complex as it sounds, but it will take a lot of time and effort.

Things to note in your search are prop size, style (component placement and arm style), and carbon thickness. At this point you've likely already decided what prop size you'd like to fly with, so there's two main styles of frame to pick from: the H and the X.Main shapeH frames are literally shaped like a sideways H: a long body with arms at either end. Typically the motors are not spaced evenly, instead the sides are pushed closer together to allow for the longer body, which houses the main components. Variants on this style include the Lumenier QAV-R and the Shendrones Shrieker.X frames have evenly spaced motors and typically a compact vertical body containing all the primary electronics. Having the center of gravity and most of the weight in the center gives a more responsive quad with equal response on the roll and pitch axes, which is more desirable for racing. Examples of this style are the Shendrones Krieger and the XHover R5X.ExtrasA couple other factors you may want to keep an eye out for are carbon thickness, arm replacement, protection, and ability to carry an HD camera. Generally arms run from 3-4mm thick, while bodies are often made of 2mm carbon fibre to reduce weight. Thinner arms do mean reduced weight, but at the expense of durability. Adding to this, the removability of the arms is important as well: frames with separate, easily removable arms, such as the QAV-R and Krieger will be easier to fix, whereas unibody frames like the Shrieker require the entire base plate to be replaced in the event of a broken arm. Finally, a more enclosed frame will protect the fragile electronic components better.As far as ability to carry an HD camera goes, generally any quad with 4\" or larger propellers can carry as much as a GoPro session or equivalent. H frames typically have more room to mount the camera; it may get a bit tight on an X frame.Frames are largely subjective, and a balance of preference, usage, and of course aesthetics.

However, features such as telemetry and audio feedback can be incredibly useful. Telemetry allows the radio not only to talk to the drone, but also allows the drone to talk back, giving information such as battery voltage, flight status, etc. Audio feedback allows you to receive this information without having to take your goggles off or turn your attention away from flying. Another bonus is the number of channels on your radio system. Quads require a minimum of 6 channels; one channel each for throttle, roll, pitch, yaw, arm, and an auxiliary channel. However, more channels allow you to remotely toggle more features, such as flight mode, rate modes, LEDs, and any other extras you may have.Typically the radio will come bundled with a receiver. Please note that not any receiver will work with any remote. Receivers are typically compatible with radios of the same make, but please check the specs! You'll also want to note the output signal from the receiver, more on that in the step on flight controllers.Some examples of popular radio systems include the Spektrum DX6 and DX9, as well as the Taranis and the new QX7.

There are literally hundreds of options, primarily divided by the central processing chip, which is an STM32F1 - F4. The most common kinds are F1, F3, and F4 chips, with the big difference being the clock speed they can run at. Overall, a faster clock speed means a smoother, better flying quad that is easier to tune. This is not to say an F1 cannot be tuned as well as an F4, it will just require more time, and may not be quite as smooth. Another bonus of the higher end F4 chip is the ability to run more demanding software, which I'll cover later as well.Signal protocolsAs mentioned before, make sure that your receiver and flight controller are compatible. There are four main signal protocols: i-Bus, s-Bus, PPM, and serial. I-Bus, S-Bus, and PPM are supported by the majority of flight controllers, and are single wire communication protocols, meaning the data from all six channels sent by the radio is transmitted along one wire. S-Bus and i-Bus are the fastest of these, but the difference is slight. Serial is a one-channel-per-wire protocol, so your standard six channel radio will require you to run six wires from the radio receiver to the flight controller. Serial is not supported by many flight controllers, notable exceptions including the Naze32 rev5 and rev6. Additionally on flight controllers that do support serial input, more than six channels are generally not supported, limiting your number of aux channels.Extra featuresOther features you may want to look for on a flight controller are OSD (on screen display, basically HUD) and an integrated PDB (power distribution board). Obviously an OSD will only be necessary if you plan to fly FPV, but having it built into the flight controller directly allows you to display more information, giving you the ability to display a virtual horizon, flight modes, and more. Having a PDB integrated directly into the flight controller will save you precious space in your final build, and allows for neater wiring. Although a relatively uncommon feature, it will come in very handy, particularly on tighter, smaller builds, just note that it will generate more heat overall.Also look for extra UART (serial) ports if you plan on including telemetry (if supported by your radio and receiver). This will send data about the quad back to the radio. Please note that this is a slightly more advanced setup which I am not overly familiar with, so please excuse the rather brief explanation. :)Some examples of popular F1 flight controllers are the CC3D and Naze32. For F3 some of the best include the Lux V2, SP Racing F3 (includes OSD and PDB), and the Betaflight F3. For F4, some of the most common are the Revolt F4, F4 EVO, and the Matek F405 (available with OSD/PDB). Finally, there's also the KISS FC.*NOTE* From personal experience, I've found the MPU6050 gyroscope used in some boards (such as the Naze rev6) to be very noisy. This will make it harder to tune, and will add minor vibrations into your quad's flight. Don't make this a determining factor, just be warned. :)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FNG/BXHH/J654OKU4/FNGBXHHJ654OKU4.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Flight Controller"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "I touched on the PDB briefly in the section on flight controllers. The PDB simple takes the power off the battery and divides it out to four traces, one for each motor. Many PDBs also have 5v and/or 12v takeoffs, which are useful for powering extra electronics that cannot be run off the flight controller or directly off the battery, such as LEDs and many FPV cameras. PDBs are usually designed to stack underneath the flight controller, and are usually pretty easy to pick out.ESC'sESCs, or electronic speed controllers, are what convert the digital signal from the flight controller into the actual output that goes straight to the motors. There's two main concerns when picking out ESCs; firmware and amp rating. The most widely used firmwares currently are BL-Heli and KISS. While many ESCs can run BL-Heli, only KISS ESCs can run the KISS firmware. The amp rating is by far the most important part of picking out a set of ESCs. This depends on the size of battery you intend to use: 3 cell, 4 cell, or even 6 cell, usually abbreviated as 3s, 4s, and 6s. I'll go more in depth in the next step, but essentially the more cells, the more power (Think acceleration and rate of climb). For a 3s battery, a 12a ESC should work fine, but you might be better off on a 20a. For 4s, a 20a ESC will work fine. Finally, for a 6s, you'll probably want to consider a 30a+ ESC, although I HIGHLY recommend building for a 4s and learning on a 3s. A 3s is predictable, a 4s is pretty insane, and a 6s is completely mental.Some common ESCs in the 4s range include the Aikon SEFM, DYS XSD series, Emax Bullet Series, FVT LittleBee, Kiss 18A, Lumenier 35A, Tattu 30A, and the TBS Bulletproof.Note that an ESC slightly larger than your requirements will work just as well. The numbers given here are rough guidelines; for a proper calculation, divide the maximum wattage of your motors by the voltage of your battery (14.8v for a 4s , 11.1v for a 3s). This will give you the minimum amperage of your ESCs.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5F/CH0G/J6FDZCYR/F5FCH0GJ6FDZCYR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4I/CV1R/J654P27W/F4ICV1RJ654P27W.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: PDB and ESC's"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "All drones run on lithium polymer (LiPo) rechargeable batteries. Racing and freestyle drones require vast amounts of power, so be warned that flight time per battery will usually run around the 2.5 - 3.5 minute mark. As mentioned earlier, the major determining factor in buying batteries is the cell count. I recommend starting on a 3s but building your quad so it can handle a 4s, which is what most pilots, such as Mr. Steele, Skitzo, and StingerSwarm fly. It is possible to learn on a 4s, but it is more difficult. If you'd like to see what a 6s looks like, check out MattyStuntz, who has some excellent flight videos. CapacityOnce you've figured out what cell count you want to start with, there's capacity. Capacity is typically measured in mAh, or milliamp hours. A common size is somewhere around 1300 to 1500 mAh, although some pilots do fly as large as a 2200 mAh LiPo. However, the weight of the battery becomes a major factor at that size, and it becomes a tradeoff of flight time, agility, and weight. C ratingFinally, there's discharge rating. This is measured in C, where the maximum output of the battery is mAh capacity * C rating = output in Amps. Note that this is not how to best determine your ESC rating, that should be calculated from the motor's max wattage. Practically, a high performance battery would run around 75-90C, while a trainer battery would be more along the lines of 30C. A lot of this depends on how bold you are with your new drone as well. :)I fly primarily 75C 1300 mAh 4s Tattu LiPos; they offer good performance and are fairly widely available. I learned on 30C 1500 mAh 3s Chinese LiPos, which, while slightly underpowered, were a great introduction to the basics of flight in the wild. Many companies sell their own rebranded LiPos; at least at the beginning, you'll be worrying more about the specs than the brand.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FP9/K62B/J654OKZC/FP9K62BJ654OKZC.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Lithium Polymer Battery"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "Finally, motors! These are pretty subjective, as a wide range of specs are available from an even larger range of manufacturers. When choosing motors, there's two numbers in particular you'll want to look for; the size and kV rating.Assuming we're talking a 4-6\" quad running a 3-4s LiPo, the most common sizes of motors are 22XX range.(A brief explanation on sizes: the first two digits measure the diameter of the motor's stator in mm, and the second two measure the height of the stator in mm)SizingFor a 5\" specifically, 2204 is typically the starting size, and anything up to 2207 is common. Similar ranges can be used on a 4\" quad, and as low as an 1806, just be aware larger motors will respond more aggressively than on a 5\". For a 6\", you may want to consider 2205 as the starting size to ensure you have adequate power. Motor SpecsMore important than the size of the motor is the kV rating. Basically, RPM at max throttle = kV * battery voltage. Higher kV motors will draw more power, reducing flight time but amplifying thrust. Typically 22XX size motors range from 2300-2600 kV, do note that 2600 kV on any size motors will give a noticeable more aggressive flight.Efficiency and overall thrust generated will vary from motor to motor, check the manufacturer's specs for more information on thrust given varying types of propellers and efficiency rating.You'll want to do a lot of looking when it comes to motors, as they're one of the most important parts of your quad when it comes to performance. From experience, I've found the Emax 2306 2400 kv motors to be extremely efficient and high thrust, managing 4.5 minutes of aggressive flight on a 1300 MaH LiPo, while my lower powered Cobra 2205's only made 3.5 minutes.Another motor you may want to consider are the T-Motor F-40. Although I have not personally flown them, the specs are similar to the Emax motors, and they are highly reviewed by a number of pilots, including Johnny FPV. I myself fly Cobra 2205 2300 kV motors; they have decent \"punch\" but are relatively efficient given their performance. However, it's totally up to you to pick your own specs for your own style of flying.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F78/62CW/J654OL1Z/F7862CWJ654OL1Z.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 10: Brushless Motors"}, {"step": 11, "steps_text": "This may seem like a minor detail, but don't overlook your props. You should already know what size you plan on flying, but there's still blade count, angle, and manufacturer. Unlike many other components, the manufacturer is a key part here because they all use different materials and different constructionsYour typical prop is plastic or glass nylon; there are carbon fibre props that perform extremely well, but at a high price, and the brittle carbon breaks easily. Your standard racing or freestyle quad usually runs triblade propellers, which give it more lift and acceleration than a double bladed prop would. Some pilots run 4 blades or even more, but beyond four the efficiency of the prop begins to drop.Blade angle is another way to increase or decrease the aggressiveness of your flight. Again, generally speaking, between 30-45 are the most common angles, with 30 being reasonably calm and 45 being crazy. Recently RaceKraft has popularized a 51 degree blade angle, but these are intended for high performance racing. When picking out props, the prop diameter and angle are commonly abbreviated together, making a 5\" prop with a 45 degree angle a \"5045\".Finally, the manufacturer. This is again a subjective choice; you may want to try various manufacturer's materials to see how they feel in flight (you'll be going through a fair number of props at first). Two of the major competitors are Gemfan and Dalprop. Gemfan's propellers are more flexible, breaking more easily but they do not stay bent, meaning you won't have to worry too much about damaged props. Dalprop, on the other hand, uses a polycarbonate and glass material that is extremely durable and will survive many hard crashes. However, props can get slightly, unnoticeably bent, which will affect flight performance. Play around with this, try different manufacturers and angles and see what suits you best.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F6I/3T8N/J654P38N/F6I3T8NJ654P38N.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 11: Propellors"}, {"step": 12, "steps_text": "The FPV camera is what gives you the live video feed to fly by. They are specifically designed to be low latency and to adjust quickly to vary light conditions. Main factors to look for are resolution (TVL), OSD, and lens size.The resolution of FPV cameras is measured in TVL or TV lines, which is a measure of how many alternating black and white lines can be displayed horizontally. Most cameras run around 600 TVL, which isn't exactly HD, but completely fine to fly by.If your flight controller does not have an on-board OSD, you may want to look for a camera that has a built in on screen display. Without the data from the flight controller, the OSD included with the camera will typically only have a timer, voltage, and text display. However, this is plenty for regular flying; you don't even need an OSD if you keep a rough track of how long you've been flying. Lens size determines how wide angle your view is. The typical range is from 2.1mm (Super wide) - 2.8mm (closer to a regular camera). The sweet spot is around 2.5mm, which is what is included with most FPV cameras.A few notable cameras you may want to consider are the Foxeer Arrow V3 and the Runcam Swift 1 & 2.

The primary thing to look for here is the transmission power. This typically runs from 200 mW to 800 mW for outdoor quads. You may find 200 mW to be a little weak, shortening your range and giving you worse reception through obstacles. However, this range may be better for flying with others, either for fun or in a race, where you have multiple quads blasting video signals over a common area. From personal experience, I've found 400 mW to be fine for flying with others as well. From 600-800 mW would be used for longer range setups or for better transmission through and around obstacles.While there are a number of generic video transmitters, one you may want to consider is the TBS Unify. While at a premium price point, it offers channel and output power switching through a compatible radio (very handy in the field). The Immersion RC Tramp is similar in that it offers channel and output switching from a compatible radio, but only to a maximum of 600 mw. Finally, one video transmitter that has been growing in popularity is the Eachine VTX03; despite it's lower power (200 mw), at $14 it's hard to go wrong.The antennae included with your goggles or video transmitter is likely a linear \"stick\" antenna, which does not have great range or coverage. Usually quads are flown with a polarized cloverleaf antenna, such as this. This gives you better video transmission and reception because of the transmission pattern. A few you may want to consider are the TBS Triumph, which, although at a premium, offers better durability and performance; and the Lumenier Pagoda, which has a completely unique and durable design at a much lower cost.

If you already know how to solder, skip this step. I'll try to give a concise introduction to it, you'll also want to check out lots of other resources, such as this. Don't be scared off by having to solder your own electronics, it's much easier than you might think, and will come in extremely useful in repairing and modifying your drone.What you're really doing Basically melting a soft metal in between two other metal joints so they stay together with good solid electrical contact. Solder joints are not intended to bear weight, just maintain a connection.Prep your surface In order for the solder to stick to the metal pad or wire you're soldering, you need to clean it first. Apply some flux paste to the surfaces you'll be soldering and heat up your iron to around 650\u00b0 for small joints and 700-750\u00b0 for larger joints. Briefly touch the tip of the iron to the fluxed surfaces to melt and boil the flux. You now have a clean \"sticky\" surface to solder to.A caution with electronics Soldering electronics has a reputation for being difficult due to the sensitive components. This means you can't hold the iron on the piece for very long without risk of damaging the sensitive circuits and chips onboard. A good rule of thumb for most pieces is that the iron should not be in contact with the piece for more than 2 seconds. For larger joints, using a wide chisel tip on the iron would be recommended, whereas a thin pointed tip will allow you to precisely solder smaller delicate joints.  Also, ensure that while your work surface is adequately ventilated to remove nasty solder fumes, that you don't have any breeze or wind blowing across the surfaces you are soldering, and that while blowing away solder fumes you don't blow on your work piece. this will unevenly cool it and create a bad solder joint.Pretinning Pretinning is one extra caution to make sure you get the best joint with as little work and contact time as possible. After you've fluxed your pieces, melt a bit of solder onto the tip of the iron and just touch it to the surface. On a wire, the solder should spread out on the immediate area and coat the wire strands in a silvery coating. You may need to get a bit more to ensure that there is solder on all parts of the wire, just make sure you put just enough on to thinly coat it. On a pad, such as a flight controller, ESC, or PDB, load up a bit more solder onto the tip and touch it to the fluxed pad. It should spread out to the corners of the pad and form a little silvery hump.  Make sure to clean the extra solder and flux off your iron frequently by wiping it on a damp sponge; many soldering stations have a holder for one. Never try to reuse old solder, and if there's any discolored or black solder or grunge on your tip, clean it off right away, dab it briefly in a bit of flux, and put some more solder on.Actually making the solder joints already Now that your surfaces are prepped, you can create the actual joint. Most of the soldering you'll be doing is wire-to-pad, which is by far the easiest. Arrange your pieces so that you can hold the surfaces together without getting your fingers too close (the board and wire will get very hot very quickly, I have many burned fingers to prove it). A \"helping hands\" solder workstation may be useful at this point. Get a bit of solder on the iron's tip, and using the tip, press down on the wire onto the solder pad. The solder on the pad from pretinning should melt and allow the wire to slip in, while the solder on the iron's tip should flow over the wire and meld with the liquid solder on the pad, create a smooth, shiny round blob. Remove the iron and hold the pieces without moving for a few seconds. Make sure you don't blow on the joint, or have air flowing around it, and that you don't move either piece until the solder has hardened (roughly 2 seconds). This will create a faulty, untrustworthy joint with stress cracks, which are visibly as a dullness in the surface. The joint should be a smooth round drop, evenly merged and shiny.Through-hole or pin soldering Depending on the style of your flight controller, ESCs, PDB, and radio receiver, you may need to mount some pins or wires through holes in the flight controller or PDB. This is super simple. If you're doing a wire, flux and tin it; if you're doing a pin, don't worry about fluxing or tinning it. Make sure you flux the top and bottom of the hole pad but don't tin it, you need to leave the hole as open as possible. Feed the tinned wire end (or un- fluxed pin) through the hole and fix it in such a way that you can hold it there for soldering. Now on the underside of the hole, where the wire or pin end is, drop a blip of solder from the iron. It should spread around the hole and flow onto the pin or wire smoothly. Again, this should be shiny and smooth. If there's wire sticking out of the solder joint after the solder has cooled, you can snip it with wire cutters to get it out of the way.I understand this is a very rough and brief introduction to soldering. Please don't take my word alone on all of this, there's many in depth tutorials out there, I didn't want to reinvent the wheel.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FT9/1MGS/J7AQWTRB/FT91MGSJ7AQWTRB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3P/H38S/J7AQWTRJ/F3PH38SJ7AQWTRJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9T/IBH9/J7AQWTRT/F9TIBH9J7AQWTRT.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 14: Soldering"}, {"step": 15, "steps_text": "Now that all that's covered, there's the actual assembling of the main power system. The main flow is as follows:Battery -- PDB -- ESCs -- MotorsMain power supplyTo start with the battery - PDB connection: You'll need a female XT60 plug, some 12-14 gauge wire, and appropriately sized heatshrink (6mm will work fine). First, solder two equal lengths (around 12-15 cm, but this will vary greatly from frame to frame: it needs to reach comfortably from the PDB to the battery) of the wire to the \"bat\" pads on the PDB. Make sure that you use differently coloured pieces of wire for the positive and negative wires, this is super important because you really, really don't want to hook this up backwards. Slip a piece of 15-20mm onto each wire, and solder on the XT60 connector, ensuring that it is soldered on the right way. This is a bit of a complicated joint, it's best explained by this video.Once your XT60 plug is soldered, slip the heatshrink over the joint and shrink it. This can be done with just a hair dryer or even a lighter, just be cautious. ESCsNow that your battery and PDB are connected, you'll need to solder on your ESCs. One side of the ESC will have four wires coming from it: one equal sized set of red and black, and a smaller of white and black (often twisted together and frequently with a connector on the end). Solder the red and black wires to the PDB, paying attention to the positive and negative markings on the PDB (red wire is positive, black is negative). Repeat this for each ESC, and don't worry about the white and black wires; those are signal wires that will be connected to the flight controller.Before you solder on the motors, make sure to check on one detail. Most recent flight controllers are equipped with a feature called pass-through: this allows you to program and adjust the ESC's settings through the flight controller, instead of having to program the ESC directly. Don't worry if you don't have pass-through, just note whether you do or not.If you do, solder the motors straight onto the opposite end of the ESC, where the three pads are. If you do not, you can still solder the motor wires directly to the ESC, just know that you'll have to desolder a couple of them later. Once you have all your ESCs soldered to the PDB, the motors soldered to the ESCs, and the power lead soldered to the PDB, the next step is to wire up the control system. Don't plug the battery in just yet, we need to make sure there's a proper signal going to the ESCs so they don't flip out when they're powered on.

Before you begin, check the specs on both your flight controller and your radio receiver for the power requirements. A number of more recent systems can be run straight off the battery (14.8v), but some require a 5v power source. If your flight controller has a built in OSD, you'll want to run it straight off the battery power (if accepted) as this will allow the OSD to display the total remaining battery voltage. Generally PDBs have a 5v and/or a 12v stepdown built in; there may also be a 5v takeoff built into your flight controller.Also depending on your flight controller style, it may be wired with pins and connectors or by direct soldering to metal pads. If you plan on using pins, make sure to solder them on first, it'll be way harder afterwards.Main powerFirst, wire the power to your flight controller. Next, solder the signal wires from the ESCs to the flight controller. Check the documentation for the flight controller to determine where to solder the signal wires. If your ESCs have a built in BEC, there will be three thin wires instead of just the two. If you plan on using the built in BEC to power your flight controller, cut off the red wires on all but one ESC, you only need one. If you are using the BEC to power a flight controller with an onboard OSD, not that the voltage will not display correctly, as the BEC is a 5v stepdown regulator. ESCsIf you're not using a BEC, simply solder wires either directly from the battery leads or from a 5v takeoff to the \"BAT\" pads (or pins) on your flight controller. You can also solder the ESC signal wires (or hook up the pin connectors) so the signal and negative ESC pads, and if you're using BEC power, solder the one red power wire to the positive ESC pad.Make sure when you solder the ESC wires on that they're connected to the right pads. The standard layout for a quad is motor 1 at the bottom right, 2 at the top right, 3 at the bottom left, and 4 at the top left, if you're looking at the quad from behind.Radio ReceiverOk, so now that we have that complicated part over, we just need the radio receiver hooked up. Solder the positive and negative power wires to the appropriate pads on your PDB, and connect the signal wires. If your receiver supports PPM, S-Bus, or i-Bus, you should only have one signal wire (usually yellow) and one input pad on the flight controller. If you're using a receiver with serial output, you'll need to connect each channel's wire to the flight controller. Check the specs on your flight controller here, many have versatile pads that can be used as an auxiliary output or for serial input.Now that your receiver is powered and connected to your flight controller, you can go ahead and add in your FPV equipment (if you so choose), but I would recommend getting the software configured and working first. For the sake of organization I'll continue with the FPV equipment installation, but I would highly recommend getting your software configured and your quad flying at this point first to work out any bugs.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5G/BKBM/J654P39X/F5GBKBMJ654P39X.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 16: Assembling: Control System"}, {"step": 17, "steps_text": "The FPV equipment is generally a very simple setup.

You'll likely have to do a wire-to-wire solder joint here; make sure you cover the joint afterwards with liquid electrical tape or heatshrink, carbon fibre IS CONDUCTIVE.If you have an OSD built into your flight controller that you'd like to use, run the video signal wire into the video in pad, and solder the video out pad to the transmitter. Also, if both your camera and transmitter support audio, solder those together as well. Once your power and video (and audio, if supported) wires are soldered, install the video transmitter antenna and you're set!

Although your build and positioning may vary with the style of your frame, the following layout works with 90% of frames.Main StackFirst, your PDB and flight controller are typically mounted in a stack in the center. Most PDBs and flight controllers have the standard 30.5mm hole mounting pattern. In this case, you can mount them on top of eachother: make sure to use some nylon standoffs to separate the two by at least a couple millimeters, as the PDB can get quite hot. If your standoffs are too tall, just sand them down to a good height. Use four long M3 (~12 mm) screws to mount the PDB and flight controller to the frame. If you're using an H frame, the longer body will give you more room to mount the other electronics. Typically the radio receiver and video transmitter are at the back, while you're determining where to put them, remember the video transmitter can get fairly hot. Mount your FPV camera (obviously) at the front, using either hardware included with the frame or the bracket included with the camera.BatteryOne final detail to arrange is battery placement. Depending on the size and style of your frame, you may not be able to put the battery on top, as is typical (H frames usually have plenty of room for a top mounted battery). If you do not have room, you can mount the battery suspended underneath, which will give you a better center of gravity, but will also risk damaging the battery in a crash.

Any FPV frame will have a place for the camera (obviously) at the front of the quad, although positioning and protection may vary. CameraThis one's not that hard. Most frames have milled holes or side plates to attach the camera and/or it's bracket to. Fasten it nice and tight, making sure you leave room for it to angle 30-45 degrees. It's best to start with it around 25 or so, but as you get better, you'll want a steeper angle.ReceiverIn a perfect world, your build will have room at the back to mount both your radio receiver and video transmitter; however, sometimes you'll have to get creative. For sure, if you have a diversity receiver with two antennae, you'll want to mount them with a 90 degree offset to get the best range. This may be done either near the middle of the quad out the top in a V tail, at the back in a V tail, or in a number of other configurations I'll cover in the next section. For now, just mount it either with double sided tape, foam tape, or velcro with a zip tie on it as well.TransmitterThe video transmitter is often the hardest part to fit in. You need to leave room for a large bulky mushroom antenna out the back, but also try to avoid getting it too close to your other electronics, as it really heats up in use. Some alternatives to mounting include 90 degree elbow connectors (stick it straight out the top) and extension pig tails, allowing you more flexibility in where you mount the actual transmitter. Some frames are also designed to mount the transmitter vertically: if in doubt, look up some other people's builds.At any rate, you will want to make sure that you have some kind of connector between your video antenna and the video transmitter.

Radio antennaeYou'll definitely want to mount your radio receiver antennas with a 90\u00b0 offset (if you have a diversity receiver with two antennae). The best way to do this is by heatshrinking them to zip ties off the back of the frame. Don't cut the antennae! The exposed wire is cut to a very specific length to get the best reception possible. Instead, put a tube of shrinkwrap around each of your back metal frame standoffs, and slide a zip tie inside it. Mount one zip tie going up and one going down. On the zip tie facing downwards, bend it to 90\u00b0 so it comes straight out the back; the other should be sticking straight up. Slip thin tubes of heatshrink along each zip ties and slide your antennae in, then heat them up to shrink them down (You may want to heat them up extra slowly to avoid damaging the wires).Video antennaThe video antenna is usually mounted out the middle of the back plate, or depending on your frame it may mount vertically, or with a vertical antenna. You'll probably want to add an adapter to the video transmitter before screwing on the antenna, so that in the case of a crash, the adapter takes the impact instead of your expensive video transmitter.However you wind up mount the video antenna, bend it so that it's at around a 45\u00b0 angle to the top frame plate. This will ensure that it's as close as possible to straight up while flying forward.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5X/13U7/J6MGD36C/F5X13U7J6MGD36C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F56/RY2O/J6MGD44I/F56RY2OJ6MGD44I.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 20: A Brief Note on Antenna Management"}, {"step": 21, "steps_text": "Once you have your physical quad built, or at least the basics, it's time to get the software on your flight controller and ESC's configured. I'll run through how to set up your ESC's if you have pass through, and how to set up Betaflight on your flight controller. Betaflight is probably the most widely used software for freestyle and racing, particularly among F1-F3 flight controllers. FlashingFlashing is the process of putting the software on your flight controller. The process will vary among flight controllers, check the included manual or online for information about your specific flight controller. Typically there is a way to enable \"bootloader\" mode when you plug it into your computer. You'll also need the Betaflight configurator (Available as a chrome app). Go to the Firmware Flasher tab, and select your board type from the top pulldown, and the version from the second pulldown. At least at the beginning, ensure the \"Show Unstable Releases\" slider is off. Leave the rest of the settings as is, and click \"Load Firmware [Online]\". This will download the required hex file; once it's finished, hit flash and wait for the board to completely finish flashing before you do anything.Receiver configurationThe first thing you'll want to do with your newly flashed board is get it responding to your radio. Depending on your setup, you may need to connect the LiPo battery to power on the radio receiver, although many flight controllers power the receiver themselves. Plug your flight controller into the USB port, connect your battery, and open up the configurator. Hit connect, then move down to the \"Configuration\" tab on the left. Scroll down to the \"Receiver\" section, and select the protocol you used. PPM, SpekSat (Spektrum sattelite), Sbus, and SUMD are single wire inputs, while PWM requires one wire per channel. If you're using iBus, just select the serial based receiver option, iBus and Sbus are just different brand name protocols.Once you've selected your receiver type, hit \"Save and Reboot\" on the bottom right, and head to the main \"Receiver\" tab on the left hand side. Make sure your radio is on and bound to your receiver, and try wiggling the sticks a bit. You should see the corresponding Roll, Pitch, Yaw, and Throttle meters move. Also flicking the auxiliary switches on your radio should move a couple of the aux channels. If you see a bit of quivering in the values even when you're not touching the sticks, don't worry, it won't affect much in flight. If you're picky, turn up the RC Deadband clicker on the right just a few digits; this creates a deadzone around the center value that ignores any input within it's range. Also make sure that your sticks are in fact moving the right values: if not, adjust the layout in the \"Channel Map\" dropdown.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FX0/EU5L/J6IF04UR/FX0EU5LJ6IF04UR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJZ/EJLR/J6IFAD1U/FJZEJLRJ6IFAD1U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIA/08N8/J6IF04V3/FIA08N8J6IF04V3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 21: Software: Flashing and Receiver"}, {"step": 22, "steps_text": "Once your receiver is configured and working with your flight controller in BetaFlight, you need to get your motors working. Make sure you have a charged LiPo ready for this part; you'll need the full battery power and you want to make sure you don't drain it dangerously low, so start with it charged. A very important note before you configure any of this: REMOVE YOUR PROPS! I can't stress this enough; you'll be spinning the motors up at this point and your quad is not predictable, no matter how \"right\" it seems. These motors spin incredibly fast (34,000 - 38,000 rpm at theoretical max throttle) and besides the risk of it taking off, props can easily slice skin deeply at a slight nick (speaking from experience).Updating ESC firmwareI'll walk through the setup process for using BLHeli ESCs with passthrough on the flight controller, as this is currently the most common setup. You'll need to get the BLHeli configurator for this (also a Chrome app). Make sure you hit disconnect on the BetaFlight configurator and shut it down first, as it can interfere with BLHeli. Hit connect on the BLHeli configurator, and wait until the screen goes mostly blank with only the two messages at the top. Plug in your battery, and hit read setup. After a few seconds, the configuration settings will pop up. First, hit Flash All at the bottom left corner, select your ESC type, MULTI as the mode (Stands for multishot, one of the most widely used modes), and the most recent version. Hit flash, and wait a few minutes for all the ESCs to finish flashing. Setting ESC parameters and calibrationTo calibrate the ESCs, we'll need to head back to the BetaFlight configurator. Disconnect from and shut down the BLHeli configurator, and open up and connect to the BetaFlight configurator again. At this point, please, Make Sure Your Props Are Removed! Unplug the LiPo, if you haven't already, and go to the motors tab. One quick explanation; the purpose of calibrating the ESCs is to make sure that they're properly adjusted to your setup. Not everything will be perfect in your build, which is why you need to calibrate the ESCs to your setup.Once in the motors tab, check the slider that enables motor control. Again, make sure your battery is NOT plugged in, and slide the master motor control slider all the way to max throttle. What we're doing is giving the ESCs a recognizable pattern to let them know we're calibrating. Now, plug in the battery.You should hear a series of three ascending bleeps. This tells you that the ESCs have recognized the max throttle value. Now, with the battery still plugged in, move the slider all the way to the bottom. Wait for a series of three descending bleeps, and your ESCs are configured!

As shown in the diagram at the top, the motors rotate in towards the front, and in towards the back, and are numbered as shown. Open up the BetaFlight configurator once again (don't worry, we're almost done with all the hopping back and forth) and drop down to the motors tab. Make sure your Props are Off, check the motor control slider, and very slowly increase the slider for motor 1. As soon as it starts to spin, leave it at its current position, and brush your finger against the side of the motor gently to figure out which way it's spinning. If you can't tell, simple bring the slider back down and watch the motor bell as it spins down. Repeat this for all the motors, making sure they're responding to the correct slider, and noting if the directions are correct (They almost certainly won't be). If your motors are responding to the wrong slider, you may have to revisit the wiring on your flight controller to make sure the ESC wires are connected properly. Write down which motors need to be reversed.Swapping motor directionsIf you don't have passthrough and your motors are spinning the wrong way, just unsolder and swap any two motor wires on the motors that need reversing. If you are using passthrough, its a little bit more complicated, although faster.Shutdown the BetaFlight configurator, open up BLHeli, read the setup, and under the ESCs that need to be reversed, just select reversed from the drop down. At this point also, under the \"Common Parameters\" box, make sure \"Brake on Stop\" is checked, and change the \"PWM Frequency / Damped\" to DampedLight if it isn't there already. This makes sure that active braking is enabled for the motors, giving cleaner flight.

Head back over to the \"Configuration\" tab, and look under the \"ESC/Motor Features\" box. Set the ESC/Motor protocol to Multishot, and ensure that the third slider is checked (since you'll really want to arm and disarm your quad with an aux switch, NOT a stick position). For the last three values, plug in your battery with the props off. If your motors twitch at all by themselves, turn up the minimum throttle value, somewhere around 1050 - 1070 will usually do the trick. The other two values are typically fine at stock settings.Drop down to the \"System Configuration\" box now. Note that these settings will change wildly depending on the capabilities of your board (F1 - F4). Typically, BetaFlight knows what's a good update and loop frequency, you can try increasing these but at your own risk. At the very bottom of the window, check the CPU load percentage after you save and reboot with a given setting. It should be under 30% at idle to leave a safe window for flight. The very last thing in this tab is Airmode. What airmode does is it keeps the PID (control) loop running even at minimum throttle, and always keeps the motors spinning as soon as your quad is armed. This allows you to control the quad even in freefall, allowing you to pull off tricks like floating upside down, and various stalls. Airmode is actually probably the best known feature in BetaFlight, and one of the reasons it's so common.Mode SwitchesHomestretch, I promise.Pop over to the \"Modes\" tab on the left. This will allow you to set your aux switches to arm and disarm your quad and enable a whole bunch of other features. First, hit \"Add Range\" under ARM. Turn on your radio, and flip the aux switches until you see the orange tick under the slider move around in response to it. You may have to change the aux channel to get a response or to get the desired switch for arming. Drag the sliders around so that when the switch is in the disarmed position, it's in the grey, and when armed, in the orange. Give it a bit of space around it too to allow for imperfections.Here are some other modes you may want to add to your arm switch:Anti-Gravity - No, not that. BetaFlight's antigravity mode just smooths out common twitches and some vibrations on aggressive throttle maneuvers, it's worth enabling.   Angle: One of BetaFlights two self - levelling modes, and the best for beginners. Angle mode returns the quad to level when there is no user input, and will not allow the quad to rotate beyond a certain angle.  Horizon: The more aggresive of BetaFlight's self levelling modes. Horizon mode does not limit the angle of the quad, allowing you to do flips and rolls, but still levelling the quad when there is no user input.  HeadFree: Best for line of sight (LOS) flying, headfree effectively ignores the quad's current yaw angle; pitching forward always angles in the same direction regardless of the quad's orientation.  Failsafe: Engages failsafe mode. Depending on your settings, this disables a quad entirely, disarming and braking the props.  Beeper: If you have a beeper installed on your quad, this causes it to emit a series of beeps, very helpful for finding a lost quad.Don't worry about the rest of the settings right now, just make sure you have something set to arm, and if you want to fly self levelling, either Angle or Horizon set to the same setting as your arm switch.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FGB/CM07/J6IF0MA9/FGBCM07J6IF0MA9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJM/UFI7/J6IF0MBF/FJMUFI7J6IF0MBF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWG/5GU9/J6IF0MBG/FWG5GU9J6IF0MBG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVC/3OF5/J6IF0MCK/FVC3OF5J6IF0MCK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 24: Software: BetaFlight Modes and Configuration"}, {"step": 25, "steps_text": "You finally made it!Whether or not you have FPV equipment installed at this point, always do your first flight line of sight, no matter how comfortable you are with FPV. Put your props on, making sure that they're facing the right way and not upside down (easier to forget than it sounds). Grab your radio and a charged LiPo and find a nice wide open, grassy field.Two quick notes: Never try to fly a 4\" or larger quad in your house. Speaking from experience; I did once and my \"perfectly fine\" quad immediately took off backwards into my foot, leaving a deep cut. Never fly near people, except yourself, and always watch for people who may walk into your flying area.Secondly, whenever you plug your LiPo into your quad, make sure your radio is turned on first. This ensures that as soon as your receiver is powered, it is receiving a signal, so there's no chance of your flight controller somehow misreading a signal and flipping out.Once you're ready, step a safe distance away, ensure that your arm and airmode switch work correctly, (propellors should spin on arm), and try hovering! Play around with the roll, pitch, and yaw to see if any changes need to be made to the sensitivity. Another good test is to cut or reduce throttle briefly, then \"catch\" it with a burst of throttle. Watch and listen for any oscillations or vibrations. Also, unless you're using HeadFree mode for line of sight, don't use too much yaw right away; it's easy to lose orientation. If you feel confident enough and your FPV equipment is already installed, give it a try. It won't be easy at first; try sitting down and keeping your radio on your lap.If you haven't installed your FPV equipment, you can add it anytime now; you've verified that it flies, so you don't have to worry about getting both systems right at the same time.

It will likely oscillate or vibrate when you apply throttle, catch it from a fall, use a punch of throttle, or do a tight sharp maneuver. This is where the complex craziness of tuning comes in.A lot of tuning is just trial and error. Yes there are hundreds of articles all claiming to have the easy solution, and I'll attempt to give an explanation myself, but a lot of it is just learned by experience. Fortunately, the stock values on BetaFlight work very well, if not perfectly, on most quads.RatesRates are the most basic part of tuning. It simply controls how fast the quad rotates per how much you move the stick, typically measured in degrees/second at \"full stick\". If you head down to the \"PID Tuning\" tab in BetaFlight, you'll see your options. Don't worry about the PID tuning for now, it gets really complex. Just to the right of the PID tuning sections for Roll, Pitch, and Yaw, however, you'll find three adjustable sliders: RC rate, Super rate, and RC expo. What these do is change how the rate of rotation is affected by the sticks' movements.First, RC rate. This is your primary adjustment: the higher the value, the faster your quad rotates. This directly affects the \u00b0/s rating.Second, Super rate. This adds an exponential curve to the RC rate, increasing the \u00b0/s rating directly and bowing the curve in the middle, giving you the ability to make smaller adjustments near mid-stick, and super fast flips and maneuvers at full-stick.ExpoLast, RC expo. This is similar to Super rate in that it creates an exponential curve, but unlike Super rate, it leaves the endpoints of the curve alone, simply softening the middle of the curve. If you have your rates at a comfortable spot but need more fine control, try adjusting this.Always be sure to save your changes!Before I leave this section, two more things. As you scroll down, you'll find two more tabs on the right side; throttle adjustments and TPA. The throttle adjustments tab allows you to adjust the throttle response in a similar fashion to the rates. TPA is a different story, I'll cover that in the next section...", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F7U/HU5T/J6MG8JFI/F7UHU5TJ6MG8JFI.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 26: Tuning: Rates and Expo"}, {"step": 27, "steps_text": "Ah, PIDs. For sure the most complex but most powerful part of tuning. PIDs are just numerical values in a calculation that determines how the quad responds to control input. In other words, they affect how the quad determines how its going to move from it's current orientation to the orientation it's supposed to be in, and how it responds to overcorrection.What they areP, I, and D stand for proportional, Integral, and Derivative. If you went to Wikipedia and looked up PID controllers, you'd be hit with an ugly equation that makes no sense. The math behind these isn't as complex as it seems, but you don't really need to know it. Really, all you need to remember are their basic functions:P: Effectively the strength of the correction when it needs to change angle; too high and it will continuously overcorrect, bouncing around; too low and the flight is extremely sloppy. Think of P as the twitch reaction that corrects the quad to its intended position.I: Effectively how the quad stays in position. This will be more noticeable in wind or freefall: too little I, and the quad hunts around, even when there is no input; too high, and you'll get more vibrations. Think of I as the measure of how well the quad holds its angle.D: Effectively a smoothing factor. D rounds out the response of P and I, giving smoother corrections: however, too high, and you can cause damage to your motors from excessive speed changes, and you controls will lag. Think of D as a rounding off of the correction value changes.What this meansOk, so math aside, BetaFlight has really good stock PIDs. However, I've found them to be typically a little low, so try roughly scaling all the numbers up a bit. I'm currently running my P and I around 60. Generally, P will be a bit higher than I, and D will be around half of either of those numbers.One thing I've found helpful is to move P and D together: if you're going to adjust your P value, try scaling D along with it. Say you do a quick flip, and notice at the end that your quad bounces a bit. That's too high a P. Move P and D both down a bit, and try flying again.If you're getting generally messy flight where the quad doesn't seem to track your flight path, increase I a bit.In summary...Really the best you can do is mess with it. Try stuff, guess at things, look up stuff online (PLEASE), whatever works for you. No set of PIDs work perfectly for two quads. TPAOne last super quick note: TPA. On higher throttle, you may notice some vibrations. TPA basically scales back the PID values at higher throttle to help get rid of these. It's that last setting on the right: TPA breakpoint sets at what throttle values (1000-2000) TPA kicks in, and the TPA value sets the gain, typically around 0.30 - 0.45 works well.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F0A/MY9G/J6MG8QJ2/F0AMY9GJ6MG8QJ2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6P/3M04/J6MG8QMF/F6P3M04J6MG8QMF.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 27: Tuning: PIDs"}, {"step": 28, "steps_text": "I wanted to throw one more section in here with some hints and tips I've learned from my own flying. FreestyleBecause freestyle is easier and less risky, I've spent most of my time practicing it. Watching some of the best pilots on YouTube like Steele, Johnny, Skitzo, Willy, and others will help you get inspired and teach you some tricks. Try to move the sticks as smoothly as possible, and hold your rate of rotation whenever possible. This will help you get that silky smooth float many pilots have mastered. To some extent, also fly in a way that compensates for some of the issues with your quad. Even \"perfect\" tunes can have trouble with sharp throttle punches or hard flat catches, so try to avoid these. Anyway, freestyle is about fun, so really as long as you're having that, you're good. :)RacingOne confession; I've never actually flown a true race. I've booted around with friends and tried to do laps as fast as possible on my own, but I've never flown an actual race.That being said, the best advice I can give is start slow. Don't worry about speed at the beginning, focus on accuracy and maneuvers. Racing is about being in complete control of your quad and thinking ahead while moving at ridiculously high speeds, so if you can master the control part before adding speed, you're well on your way. Try to find a large, open, grassy field. Hitting anything at race speeds isn't going to be good, but grass is comparitively soft. In fact, most of the pictures in this instructable were taken in the middle of a big overhaul that happened after a high speed pass under a tree nicked a branch and flew into a concrete cinder block, at around 50 kmh. I cracked the top and bottom frame plates, damaged my GoPro, killed my FPV camera, 3 motors, and the flight controller had a close shave (literally). So yeah, practice at low speed, and just get comfortable with the maneuvers.Finally, please make sure to fly legally. With drones becoming more widespread, more rules are being put in place.

Having an HD recording camera is a great bonus as it allows you to review your flight and critique yourself and your tune. You don't need to go straight to a GoPro: there's a number of cheaper cameras available in the $100 range, such as the Mobius and Foxeer Legend.However, if you do decide to go the GoPro route, I can say from experience that the footage will be considerably better quality. The GoPro session is also a very convenient size for a mini quad, and even the Session 4 has excellent image quality. Regardless of what HD camera you decide on, I would recommend a 3D printed mount. Although more expensive than a simple piece of foam, they will protect the camera far better, and will absorb more vibrations from the quad, giving you smoother video and avoiding \"jello\" (rolling shutter; jiggly, wavy video). As for the durability, the crash which destroyed my frame hit the GoPro mount head on without leaving so much as a mark: the only damage was on the unprotected side (a slight scratch).Most importantly, have fun, de-stress, and stay inspired.

The reason the title of this Instructable contains the \"SK450 Dead Cat\" bit is because that is the name of the frame we will use to construct the quadcopter - more on that later. The frame design was inspired by a quadcopter built by Bart Jansen, a Dutch artist, that featured the taxidermied body of his pet cat, Orville, as a major structural component. We will not be using dead animals as part of our quadcopter in this Instructable though.This Instructable will show you how to build your very own quadcopter specifically designed for aerial photography/videography. Here you will also find theoretical discussions, tips, tricks, and other resources that I hope will get you well on your way to becoming a quadcopter expert.  Inspiration  Ask just about any quadcopter pilot why they became interested in quadcopters and you will almost certainly hear how they were fascinated by the grace with which quadcopters fly, or the beauty in their mechanical simplicity, or their usefulness as a artistic platform. Well, I am not going to deviate from this cliche here; since the first time I saw a quadcopter in flight, I was hooked, and I knew I had to try building one for myself. There is something viscerally satisfying about seeing a craft you painstakingly researched, assembled, and programmed take to the air. Attach a camera to your quadcopter (as we will do in this tutorial) and you can see the world from a perspective normally reserved for birds. I am sorry if this is all getting a bit starry-eyed, but I truly think quadcopters are beautiful crafts, and I think you will agree after building your own. Let's get to it.  Craft DesignLet's begin by taking a moment to discuss the design of the quadcopter we will be building in this Instructable because it is a bit different than the design of traditional quadcopters. Normally, a quadcopter, which, by the way, is a multirotor aircraft with four rotors, has a central body with four equally-spaced arms extending outwards. Each arm is offset by 90o from its neighbors. In other words, the craft is shaped like a perfect square.  The difference between this traditional design and the one we will be building in this Instructable is that the front arms on our SK450 Dead Cat quadcopter are angled more towards the back of the craft. See the diagram on this step for clarification. By angling the front arms back a bit, we can make sure that, when a camera is mounted on the front of the craft, the rotors stay out of shot, producing better videos.

My first day of flying was fairly successful; I did some maneuvering, some high-altitude flying, and captured some pretty cool footage (see below). Unfortunately, the day ended with a propeller embedded in the ground and one of the quadcopter's arms snapped in half. So I need to effect some repairs on the craft and do some more tuning, a topic which we will cover in the 27th step of this Instructable. When you first start flying quadcopters, you will crash a lot so just be prepared for that - emotionally and with spare parts.", "title": "An SK450 Dead Cat Quadcopter to Call Your Own", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/A-SK450-Dead-Cat-Quadcopter-to-Call-Your-Own/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "To make your very own SK450 Dead Cat quadcopter, you are going to need to order some parts, quite a few parts in fact. Before I list the parts used in this tutorial, I just wanted to make a note about the supplier I chose when purchasing components. I ordered all of the components used in this tutorial from HobbyKing. HobbyKing is an online retailer of a wide-range of hobby parts, including parts for building multirotor aircraft. The reason I chose to order components from HobbyKing is, quite simply, because their prices are very low. Now, I do not intend this page to be a review of HobbyKing, or of any of the products listed, but I just wanted to note that the trade-off for HobbyKing\u2019s low prices is slow shipping speeds and non-existent customer service. This last point is probably the biggest drawback to using HobbyKing, their customer service is absolutely pathetic. If you don't want to use HobbyKing, you can usually find the parts you need from sellers on ebay. You will need the materials in the table below to construct the SK450 Dead Cat quadcopter in this tutorial - by the way, that name will make more sense after you read the list. I included some notes about each component below the table. The notes are numbered and correspond to the numbers in the left column of the table. One last detail and then I promise we will get to the parts list. HobbyKing has warehouses located in many countries, with their main warehouse located in Hong Kong. I found that ordering all of my quadcopter parts from the Hong Kong (international) warehouse led to extremely high shipping costs (for me $114). So, after a lot of experimentation, I found that I could minimize shipping costs by ordering some components from the international warehouse, and some parts from the U.S.A. warehouse.

The total price for the parts themselves (not including shipping) is in the range of $250.  Parts Notes   The SK450 frame kit contains the arms, motor mounting plates, flight controller mounting plate, and hardware for the quadcopter frame.       The Dead Cat conversion kit is named after a quadcopter created by Dutch artist, Bart Jansen, which used his deceased, taxidermied pet cat, Orville, as a major frame component. I find Jansen\u2019s craft distinctly disturbing, but I do admire his undeniable creativity. The kit modifies the center part of the quadcopter body to make mounting a camera easier.       The Turnigy 2200mAh lithium-polymer battery is the power source for the quadcopter. You only need one battery for your quadcopter, however, I recommend buying a second one so that in the field, you can quickly swap out the first battery after it goes flat and continue flying. Depending upon the payload I put on the my quadcopter, and how aggressively I fly, I get anywhere from five to ten minutes of flight time on a charge. This might not sound like a lot of time, but it actually feels like plenty of time when you are flying. Now you could buy a battery with more capacity, but batteries get rapidly more expensive with increasing capacity and they also get heavier.       The Accucel-6 is the charger for the battery. Note that you will need a 12V power source with a barrel jack connector to power the charger. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t think HobbyKing sells one, but you can pick one up from any electronics retailer. You can actually also use your car battery as a power source for the charger using the included alligator clip connectors.       The Q Brain is the component that takes commands from the flight controller (which in turn takes commands from you) and from those commands controls the quadcopter\u2019s four motors. The Q Brain combines four electronic speed controllers (ESCs) into one package, which makes for a cleaner quadcopter setup.       The Turnigy Multistar 2213-980Kv 14Pole Multi-Rotor Outrunner are the motors we\u2019ll use in this tutorial. Now when it comes to choosing motors for your quadcopter, you have a near-infinite number of choices and I don\u2019t want to make this step any longer than it already is. There is plenty of other information around the internet about choosing motors though.       The 10x4.5 props are powered by the motors and provide the lift for our quadcopter. Choosing props, like choosing ESCs and motors, is a complicated decision making process but it is again one that is covered in detail by other writers. These particular props come in packs of four so you will only need one. However, props are always the first things to break in a crash, and since you will inevitably crash (sorry, it\u2019s true), you should grab a few extra sets.       The HobbyKing KK2.1 flight controller is responsible for receiving commands from the pilot, monitoring data from its onboard sensors, doing calculations based on those commands and that sensor data, and then then issuing commands to the ESC to control the motors to move the quadcopter. The HobbyKing KK2.1 is a fantastic flight controller but it does have a steep learning curve. The KK2.1 features an onboard LCD screen for its user-interface, meaning that programming the flight controller is extremely easy and does not require a laptop or specialized software. You will have to do a lot of research to understand the different settings, but once you do, it is trivially easy to change settings in the field if you have to. Plus the KK2.1 is extremely affordable.       The Turnigy 6X is a six-channel radio transmitter. The transmitter features two control sticks that can move in two directions each, plus two toggle switches. The transmitter comes with a compatible receiver. You will need four AA batteries for the controller and you might want to get a lanyard so you can hang the transmitter around your neck, which makes it easier to control since your hands can concentrate on moving the sticks instead of supporting the weight of the transmitter.       The Turnigy BESC Programming Card is used to program the Q Brain.       These three-wire servo connectors are used to connect the radio receiver to the KK2.1 flight controller.

In this step we will add these camera mount struts to the quadcopter.  On the front of the SK450 Dead Cat bottom plate, there is a kind of shelf that holds a camera for aerial photography, videography, or FPV (or it can hold a camera gimbal). This shelf is a bit of a cantilever though, so to make sure it does not flex too much under the weight of an attached camera, and also to prevent the shelf from bouncing and messing up your video. We will now add two struts to provide support for the shelf.  The struts themselves come in three parts:\u00a0 a metal rod threaded at both ends, and two universal joint pieces. To assemble the struts, screw a universal joint piece onto each end of each threaded rod. Adjust the universal joint pieces so that they are parallel.  The two struts mount onto the SK450 frame with two ball-joints each. We will attach the struts first to the SK450 top plate, and then to the camera shelf on the bottom plate. First, pick up one the struts you assembled and one of the ball-joints. Put the threaded end of the ball-joint through the universal joint on one end of the strut. Then, put the threaded end of the ball-joint up through one of the holes in the top body plate. Finally, place a dot of thread lock onto the ball-joint screw and screw a nut onto the ball-joint to hold it in place. If you are a bit confused at this point, take a look at the images on this step for clarification; this step is not as complex as it sounds. Repeat this process with the other strut.  At this point you should have the two struts attached to the SK450 top body plate. Now we will attach the other ends of the struts to the camera shelf. First though, you will need to adjust the length of the struts by screwing down or loosening the universal joints. You want the struts to be fairly tight so that the camera shelf can only bend a tiny bit before running out of slack and being held in place nicely by the struts.  Like before, insert the threaded end of the ball-joint through the universal joint on the strut, and down through the hole in the camera shelf.

I am not sure why the landing feet are designed this way. Anyway, apply a dab of thread lock to each of the screws and screw down the landing feet.

By this point, you should have your SK450 Dead Cat quadcopter frame mostly assembled. The only frame parts yet to be attached are the motor mounts; that\u2019s because we need to attach the motors to the motor mounts before attaching the motor mounts to the SK450 frame. The entire process will involve three steps: attach the prop adapters to the motors, attach the motors to the motor mounts, and attach the motor mounts to the SK450 frame.  So first we will attach the prop adapters to the tops of the motors. The prop adapters are used to affix the props to the motors. Begin by removing the nuts and metal plates from each of the prop adapters. Then, use three of the smaller, hex-head screws to attach each prop adapter to the top of a motor. Then, finally, replace the metal plate and nut. Note that we will wait until later to attach the props.  If I may digress, this actually brings up the most important safety rule for working with quadcopters or any other multirotor aircraft. Never, ever, ever work on your quadcopter while the props are in place and the battery is attached. While the motors are at speed the props are just like blades and can cause horrific injuries when they hit flesh. I am not going to post any images here because they can be very graphic but if you have a strong stomach you can find plenty with a simple image search. Always remove your battery and/or props before doing any work on your quadcopter.  Back to the task at hand. Now that the prop adapters are in place on the tops of the motors, we will attach the motors to the SK450 frame\u2019s motor mounting plates. If you look at the bottom of the motors, you will see four screw holes and a big hole in the middle through which the motor shaft is visible. Now, if you shift your gaze to the motor mounts, you will see the same arrangement of four screw holes surrounding a larger hole in the middle. The mounting holes on the bottom of the motors are not symmetrical, so you will need to rotate the motor mounting plates until the holes line up. Use the Philips screws included with the motors to affix the motor mounting plates to the bottom of the motors.  Now for the last step, attaching the motor mounts (now with the motors attached) to the SK450 Dead Cat frame. There are six holes around the edge of each motor mount, but we will only be using four because the other two are occupied by screws holding on the landing feet. You will probably want to orient each motor so that the wire leads point down the quadcopter arm. Down the road we will work on fastening all the loose wires to the frame. With the motor oriented properly and the screw holes lined up, apply a dab of thread lock to each screw and proceed to attach each motor mount to the SK450 frame.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FOX/LR2W/HSTP1PJ1/FOXLR2WHSTP1PJ1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSL/ODNY/HSTP1PJ8/FSLODNYHSTP1PJ8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3Y/1U1V/HSTP1PJD/F3Y1U1VHSTP1PJD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3I/YXS7/HSVTB0ZG/F3IYXS7HSVTB0ZG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5R/T20C/HSTP1PJJ/F5RT20CHSTP1PJJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPC/MWTE/HSTP1PJT/FPCMWTEHSTP1PJT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI7/Q1KF/HSTP1PK5/FI7Q1KFHSTP1PK5.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Mount Motors"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "In order to connect the battery to the quadcopter\u2019s electronics system, we will need to solder a battery connector to the Q Brain four-in-one ESC.

But, before we can do that, we will just need to solder a battery connector to the battery leads of the Q Brain.  So, while your soldering iron is heating up, you will need to determine the orientation of the plug. In other words, since the plug is polarized (it will only work in one direction) you need to know which wire attaches to which plug pole. The battery plugs - which, by the way, are called XT60 plugs - are shaped like arrows, with a flat end and a pointy end. The red wire from the Q Brain should be soldered to the flat end of the plug and the black wire should be soldered to the pointy side.  Now to the actual soldering process. First, slip a \u00bd\u201d piece of shrink tubing over each of the Q Brain\u2019s battery leads. Then, using care because soldering irons are obviously very hot, solder the Q Brain battery leads to the XT60 plug in the order mentioned above.

The work of actually attaching the Q Brain is done with zip-ties as shown in the pictures since the Q Brain lacks any kind of mounting brackets or holes.  After you are done fastening down the Q Brain, we will do a tiny bit of wire routing.

Specifically, we will mount the radio receiver onto the top body plate just in front of the flight controller assembly. If you look at this area, you will see two large holes in the top body plate. Position the radio receiver between these two holes and slide it partially underneath the flight controller mounting plate so that the radio receiver pins are accessible through the horizontal slot on the front of the flight controller mounting plate. Fasten the radio receiver down with a zip-tie.  The radio antenna will be dangling out the front of the quadcopter.

With the flight controller and radio receiver both attached to the quadcopter, we can now connect them together electrically.  Now, I am going to take a moment to explain the connections on the radio receiver, then, in the next section, I will explain the connections on the KK2.1, and finally I will explain how to attach the two.About the Radio Receiver Connections  So, if you take a look at the radio receiver, you will notice that the connections come in sets of three pins. The label on the top of the receiver shows which rows belong to which channel. Each channel corresponds to a different action on the radio transmitter. For example, channel one receives commands when you move the right stick left and right, channel two receives commands when you move the right stick up and down, et cetera  Each of the three pins for each channel carries a different electrical connection. There is a tiny little legend underneath the label for channel one that shows which pin carries which signal, but this legend is difficult to see, so let me put it in words:\u00a0 the outside row of pins is ground, the middle row of pins is power, and the inner row of pins is signal.About the KK2.1 Connections  Now that you understand the connections on the radio receiver, direct your attention to the flight control board. Looking at the board from the bottom (button side) you will find the connections for the radio receiver to the left of the screen. There are five rows of three pins. Just like on the radio receiver, each row of three pins corresponds to a different radio transmitter channel.  The channels on the KK2.1 board are a bit more difficult to understand than the ones on the radio receiver though because, if you take a look at the bottom of the board (you might need to peek through a slot in the mounting plate), you will notice that the rows are labeled for airplanes, not for quadcopters. Starting with the top row of pins, the order goes aileron, elevator, throttle, rudder, auxiliary. These labels correspond to the various control surfaces (flaps) used to control airplanes in flight. So we will need to form a mental map of the way these airplane controls correspond to quadcopter controls.  Just like airplanes have four control channels, so too do quadcopters, but the terminology used for quadcopter control is a bit different. The four control channels are roll, pitch, yaw, and throttle. To translate the KK2.1 receiver connections from airplane terminology to quadcopter terminology, we just need to substitute the airplane-related words for quadcopter-related words:  \u00a0aileron \u2192 rollelevator \u2192 pitchrudder \u2192 yawthrottle \u2192 throttle (which means altitude for quadcopters)  This terminology is actually really important. You should make sure to memorize the relationship between airplane controls and quadcopter controls because throughout the rest of this tutorial I will often be using these terms interchangeably; and this is the same for many other sites. It will make your life much easier if you do not have to come back here to look at the above chart every time you encounter one of these words.  The auxiliary connection is the same for airplanes and quadcopters since it is just used to control other accessories like lights or the auto-leveling feature.Connecting the Radio Receiver to the Flight Controller  Armed with your new knowledge of the radio receiver and flight controller pin layouts, we can now connect the two parts\u00a0 together. Before we begin, there is just one more piece of information to consider:\u00a0 on the radio receiver, all of the ground and power pins (the outside and middle pins) are connected together. Therefore, we only need to connect one ground pin and one power pin to the KK2.1 flight control board. The practical upshot of this is that we will only need three servo leads to complete all the electrical connections.  First, plug one of the servo leads across the three pins on the radio receiver that correspond to channel one. Orient the plug so that the brown wire is on the outside. Then, plug the other end of the servo lead into the aileron plug on the KK2.1 board, which is the top one. This plug should be oriented with the brown wire on the outside pin. On my quadcopter, I stuck the wire underneath the flight control board just to prevent the wire from hanging out in open air.  Now for the next wire. Since we\u2019ve already connected a ground and power wire from the KK2.1 board to the radio receiver, we will only need a signal connection for the remaining three signals. Conveniently, the servo leads happen to have three wires. So, connect the second servo lead going down the row of inside pins (signal pins) with the yellow wire plugged into channel two, the red wire plugged into channel three, and the brown wire plugged into channel four. Then, plug the other end of the wire into the pins closest to the screen on the KK2.1. The yellow wire should be closest to the aileron plug.  There is one last connection to make, the connection for the auxiliary channel, which we will use to turn on and off the self-leveling feature of the KK2.1 via the left switch on the radio transmitter. More on that later, for now connect another servo wire, this time across the entire fifth row of columns on the radio receiver.

Binding pairs the radio receiver and radio transmitter so that the devices recognize each other and are able to communicate.  First, turn on your radio transmitter and connect your battery to the battery connector we soldered onto the Q Brain a while back.

In this step, we will use a BESC programming card to program the Q Brain.  Before we connect the Q Brain to the flight controller, we will need to program the Q Brain. Programming the Q Brain, or any ESC, involves adjusting a number of settings related to the electrical system and flight performance. To program the Q Brain, we will use the BESC Programming Card and the connection hub that came with the Q Brain.  First, if you take a look at the Q Brain connection hub, you will notice that there are four rows of three pins each. Now if you look at the Q Brain, you will notice four sets of colored wires terminated with three-pin headers. We will discuss exactly what each of these wires is for in the next step, but for now, just note that among these colored wire connectors, only one actually has three wires connected to it, a black one, a red one, and a white one. Plug this connector into the top row of the connection hub with the black wire to the left and white wire to the right. Now plug in all of the remaining colored wires with the wires themselves on the right side of the connection hub.  With all the Q Brain control leads connected to the hub, plug the connection hub wire into the top of the BESC Programming Card in the position marked BEC. Notice that there are three pins on this connector, labeled signal, +, and -. The white wire from the connection hub should be connected to the signal pin. Finally, plug the battery into the Q Brain battery connecter we soldered on earlier.  The BESC Programming Card should now light up with LEDs that indicate the current settings on the Q Brain. Each row of lights represents a setting on the Q Brain:Brake: on/off   The brake setting determines how the motors behave when the throttle is set to zero.        On: The motors stop immediately when the throttle is set to zero. This setting allows the quadcopter to lose altitude more quickly, and can also be very useful in preventing damage in an impending crash, but additional power is required to stop the motors, which reduces battery life.         Off: When the throttle is set to zero, the motos coast to a stop naturally. This action requires no additional power and so it increases battery life, but in an emergency situation the props may still be spinning after the throttle is zeroed out.   Battery Type: Li-xx or Ni-xx   The battery type setting simply specifies the type of battery used to power the quadcopter.  Cut Off Type:\u00a0 low/middle/high   The cut off type setting specifies at which point, as the battery drains and starts outputting less voltage, the quadcopter will cut power to prevent damage from a low-voltage condition.  Start Mode:\u00a0 normal/soft/very soft   The start mode setting determines how quickly the motors accelerate from stationary during takeoff. A setting of normal means the quadcopter will get off the ground very quickly. A setting of soft or very soft means the quadcopter will get off the ground more slowly, which can make for more appealing videos.  Timing Mode:\u00a0 low/middle/fast   The timing mode setting is complex, but it roughly adjusts the speed with which the ESC communicates with the motors. In general, motors with a higher number of poles should use higher timing modes, and motors with fewer poles should use lower timing modes.  Music   The music setting can be used to play music through your ESCs my adjusting the vibrational frequency of the motors. I have no idea why this particular feature exists, but it is actually really fun and very amusing. You can use the music setting to set a song that the quadcopter will play every time you start it up. To set a song, select the music setting and use the left/right keys. There are many different songs that are represented by different combinations of LEDs.  Governor Mode:\u00a0 on/off   Governor mode basically determines how the Q Brain will adjust the lift produced by each motor. With governor mode on, the speed of the rotors remains constant and lift is adjusted by adjusting the amount of power delivered to the motor. With governor mode off, the lift produced by each motor is adjusted by adjusting the rotational speed of the motor.  For our SK450 Dead Cat quadcopter, I recommend using the following settings when you are first starting to fly, particularly if you plan to do aerial photography:    Brake \u2192 Off     Battery Type \u2192 Li-xx     Cut Off Type \u2192 Low     Start Mode \u2192 Soft     Timing Mode \u2192 Middle     Music \u2192 (feel free to experiment)     Governor Mode \u2192 Off ", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJN/IVKE/HSVTB0LX/FJNIVKEHSVTB0LX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLQ/V5KP/HSVTB0N0/FLQV5KPHSVTB0N0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOW/CYZ7/HSVTB0NI/FOWCYZ7HSVTB0NI.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 14: Program Q Brain"}, {"step": 15, "steps_text": "In this step, we will connect the motors to the Q Brain.  Now that we\u2019ve finished programming the Q Brain, we can connect the motors to the Q Brain. Before starting this process though, disconnect the battery and the BESC Programming Card from the Q Brain.  Each of the four motors have three wire leads and the Q Brain has four sets of three wire leads. Now, the order in which you connect these three wires is important because it determines the rotation direction of the motor. However, there is no easy way to tell which order is correct. So we will just have to guess. For now, just connect the three motor leads from each motor to the three wires leads from each set from the Q Brain. In a couple of steps, we will test the rotational direction of the motors, and, if necessary, we will reverse the direction by switching any two of the motor\u2019s leads. But we are not ready for that yet.  At this point, you may also want to do a little wire routing. Some people are more particular than others about exactly how much organization the quadcopter\u2019s wiring really needs. I, for example, like all of my wires to be completely fastened down, which you will probably notice in the pictures. But doing extensive wire routing can be frustrating and time-consuming, so if you just want to get to flying, you can minimize the amount of routing you do.", "step_imgs": ["https://www.instructables.com/files/deriv/FOU/R0VD/HSVTB0T6/FOUR0VDHSVTB0T6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWP/QITX/HSVTB0U6/FWPQITXHSVTB0U6.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 15: Connect Motors to Q Brain"}, {"step": 16, "steps_text": "In this step we will connect the Q Brain to the flight controller so that the flight controller can issue commands to control the motors.  Let\u2019s now connect the Q Brain to the flight controller. There are four connections from the Q Brain to the flight controller that allow the KK2.1 to control the four motors. To start the process, disconnect Q Brain\u2019s wires from the connection hub we were using earlier and set the connection hub aside.  Like the connections for the radio receiver, each connection on the KK2.1 for the Q Brain has three pins:\u00a0 a ground pin, a power pin, and a signal pin. Also like the connections for the radio receiver, only one power and one ground connection is needed. That is why, if you examine the colored wires from the Q Brain, you will notice that, even though each is connected to a three-pin female connector, only one actually has three wires connected to it, because only one ground and one power connection is needed.  There are two problems however. First, the order of the motors around the quadcopter does not match the order expected by the KK2.1 flight control board. Fortunately, this is an easy problem to fix; we will just modify the order in which we plug the Q Brain signal wires into the flight controller. We\u2019ll do that a bit later. The second problem is a bit trickier to solve. Although the fact that only one of the four plugs incorporates power and ground connections saves wire, the power and ground connections are attached to the wrong plug. The KK2.1 flight controller only takes power through the Output 1 connection, so we will need to make sure that the power and ground wires plug into the appropriate spots.  Let\u2019s fix this second problem now. What we are going to do is detach the power and ground wires from the Motor 3 plug, and re-attach them to the Motor 4 plug because the Motor 4 plug will actually go into the Output 1 spot. More on that later, for now, just follow these instructions:   The wires are held into the plugs by plastic clips. Using a knife point, small screwdriver, or other small prying instrument, pry up the plastic clip above the black ground wire. Then, pull the wire out.     Use the same procedure to remove the middle wire from the plug.     Pick up the Motor 4 plug, which is the one with the brown wire and slip the red power wire into the middle slot.     Slip the black ground wire into the last remaining slot, the one opposite the white wire.  Now that we\u2019ve fixed the power and ground connections, we can start connecting wires. On the KK2.1, the outside (farthest away from the screen) pins are ground, the middle pins are power, and the interior pins are signal. So, starting from the top row of pins, route the brown wire that we just attached the power and ground connections to through one of the holes in the top body plate and plug in the connector so that the brown wire plugs into the interior pin. Next, the white wire plugs into the third row of pins, again with the wire itself on the interior spot. The yellow wire comes next, plug that in as well. And finally, plug in the red wire to the fourth row.\n        ", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTZ/R40P/HSVTB0XP/FTZR40PHSVTB0XP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYV/D13R/HSVTB0XQ/FYVD13RHSVTB0XQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZM/WYMS/HSVTB0XS/FZMWYMSHSVTB0XS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDS/SQ5Z/HSVTB0XT/FDSSQ5ZHSVTB0XT.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 16: Connect Q Brain to Flight Controller"}, {"step": 17, "steps_text": "In order to make all of the motors behave in the same way to our commands, we need to calibrate the Q Brain so that it knows the maximum and minimum throttle signals output by our radio transmitter.  We have just one more task to take care of before we are done setting up the Q Brain, and that is to calibrate the throttle limits.  Let me take a moment to explain what that means with a bit of an experiment. Let\u2019s see what happens if we pretend that we are about to fly our quadcopter and we are lifting off the ground. First of all, connect the battery to the quadcopter and turn on your transmitter. Before we can turn on the motors, we will need to arm the KK2.1. To do this, move the left stick fully down and to the right. Now, with the KK2.1 armed, slowly increase the throttle.  You will probably notice that the four motors do not start moving in unison and they may not start until you move the throttle stick up quite a bit. This is the problem we are trying to solve in this step. The Q Brain does not know the maximum and minimum throttle signals output by our transmitter.  So to remedy this problem, we need to tell the Q Brain the maximum and minimum throttle values output by the radio transmitter. After we finish this process, all the motors should start turning at exactly the same time, and they will also all respond the same way to changes in roll, pitch, and yaw.  Let\u2019s get started by unplugging the top Q Brain connector from the KK2.1; this is the one with three wires. Next, turn on the radio transmitter and set the throttle to maximum, in other words, move the left stick to the top. Then plug the battery into the quadcopter. Here is where things get a tiny bit complex. Hold down the two outside buttons on the KK2.1. While you are holding down the buttons, plug back in the Q Brain connector, which will power up the KK2.1. Listen for two short beeps, and then, while continuing to hold down the two outside buttons on the KK2.1, move the throttle stick to the bottom. Now you should hear a long beep, which means that the throttle calibration is complete.  When you release the KK2.1 buttons, the flight controller will start up in normal mode. You can verify that the throttle limit calibration was indeed a success by repeating the experiment we did earlier. Arm the KK2.1 and try slowly increasing the throttle control again. This time, all four motors should start up at the same time.

Specifically, in order to control the craft, the KK2.1 must know the locations of all four motors relative to itself. In this step, we will program the KK2.1 so that it knows this information.  With the KK2.1 flight controller hooked up to the Q Brain and the radio receiver we can now start the process of programming the KK2.1 so that our quadcopter flies correctly.  In this and the next four steps, we are going to be inputting a whole bunch of numbers into the KK2.1 for various flight parameters. Before we start doing that though, I wanted to take a quick 288 characters to explain a bit about where these numbers come from and what the settings mean. In this step I just want to include some basic background information so that you have a rough understanding of what we\u2019ll be doing, instead of just blindly pressing buttons. For more information you should definitely do some Google research.  So, let\u2019s start by talking about how the KK2.1 controls your quadcopter. In order to control the movement of the quadcopter, the KK2.1 adjusts the lift produced by each of the four rotors. By adjusting the amount of lift produced in just the right way, the KK2.1 can make the craft ascend, descend, or tilt to move in any direction.  In order to determine exactly how to control each motor, the KK2.1 uses, as you might expect, quite a lot of math. I am not going to explain how all this math works - frankly I don\u2019t understand it all myself - but I will explain the mathematical foundation upon which all of the flight calculations rely. In order to calculate the lift required by each motor correctly, the KK2.1 must know the exact position of each of the four motors relative to itself. By knowing these positions, the KK2.1 can calculate the leverage each arm has over the orientation of the quadcopter. Using this information, the KK2.1 can calculate how to adjust the lift produced by each motor and move the craft.  In order to express the positions of the motors in terms that the KK2.1 can understand, we must do some math of our own. Since my purpose here is only to provide some basic information, I will not discuss these calculations on this page, but I would encourage you, again, to do some research if you are interested. The math required to determine the positions of the motors is not too complex; you learned all the math skills you\u2019ll need in high school. Basically, each of the numbers we will be inputting into the KK2.1 Mixer Editor represents the sine of various angles.  For now though, let\u2019s quit with the background information and start programming the KK2.1. The first step is, of course, to turn on our KK2.1. To to his, simply attach a battery to the battery plug we soldered into the Q Brain a while back. You should see the screen on the KK2.1 light up and, after flashing some information about the hardware and firmware versions of the KK2.1, you will see the home screen, which should display the word \u201cSAFE\u201d followed by some information about the quadcopter.  Just one more thing before we get to programming. The KK2.1 has four buttons used to navigate the user-interface. From left to right, the buttons are Back, Up, Down, Select.  Let\u2019s get started. The first settings we will adjust are the those in the Mixer Editor, which are the settings that, as we just discussed, tell the KK2.1 the positions of the four motors. In the bottom-right corner of the KK2.1 home screen, you will see the word Menu. Press the far right button to access the menu. There are a whole bunch of different settings in this menu, and we will get to most of them quite soon, but for now scroll down to Mixer Editor, which is the tenth item in the list. With Mixer Editor selected, press the Enter button.  In the upper-right corner, you will see a CH:1 label, this means that we are specifying the position of Motor 1. For reference, Motor 1 is the front-left motor, Motor 2 is the front-right motor, Motor 3 is the rear-right motor, and Motor 4 is the rear-left motor. To change a setting, use the Up and Down buttons to scroll through the list, and press the Enter button to select a setting. Use the Up and Down arrows again to change it the selected setting and when you are done, press Enter again to save the setting. The settings we\u2019ll need are as follows:Motor 1 Mixer Editor Settings    Throttle: 95       Aileron: -34       Elevator: 94       Rudder: 78       Offset: 0       Type:\u00a0 ESC       Rate: High   When you are done entering the above settings for Motor 1, switch to Motor 2 by moving the cursor up to the CH:1 label and pressing enter. Then we will repeat the process above to adjust the Mixer Editor settings for Motor 2.Motor 2 Mixer Editor Settings    Throttle: 95       Aileron: 34       Elevator: 94       Rudder: -78       Offset: 0       Type:\u00a0 ESC       Rate: High   You\u2019ve probably pretty much mastered the Mixer Editor menu by now so continue by entering the Mixer Editor settings for Motor 3 and Motor 4.Motor 3 Mixer Editor Settings    Throttle: 82       Aileron: -71       Elevator: -71       Rudder: -100       Offset: 0       Type:\u00a0 ESC       Rate: High  Motor 4 Mixer Editor Settings    Throttle: 82       Aileron: 71       Elevator: -71       Rudder: 100       Offset: 0       Type:\u00a0 ESC       Rate: High  ", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F7R/W34O/HSVTB14D/F7RW34OHSVTB14D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9M/3R9C/HSVTB14Z/F9M3R9CHSVTB14Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLC/T64Q/HSVTB15I/FLCT64QHSVTB15I.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZI/YT5S/HSVTB15K/FZIYT5SHSVTB15K.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 18: Mixer Editor"}, {"step": 19, "steps_text": "The KK2.1\u2019s PID loop makes sure that, when we issue commands to the quadcopter, those commands are executed quickly, but without being so aggressive that we lose control of the craft. In this step, we will program the KK2.1 so that a balance is struck between responsiveness and control.  So now the KK2.1 knows the positions of the motors, but we still need to give it more information before our SK450 Dead Cat quadcopter will fly correctly. In this step we will adjust the settings for the PID loop. Like I did in the last step, I just want to take a moment to explain what the PID loop does and what we are trying to accomplish by adjusting its settings. Note though that the PID controller is probably the most conceptually complex part of the quadcopter, so don\u2019t worry if the following information is a bit confusing.  A PID loop is a very common control mechanism (probably one of the most common) that is widely used in numerous control systems, including, of course, our KK2.1 flight control board. The role of a PID loop is to detect and attempt to correct errors between a measured process variable and the desired value of that variable. In the case of our quadcopter, when we are flying, we give the quadcopter certain control inputs and we want the quadcopter to obey our input as closely as possible. Lets use an example to make the role of the PID controller more clear: let\u2019s say we want the quadcopter to stop flying level and instead pitch forward by five degrees in order to move forward. When we first tilt our elevator (pitch) stick forward, there is an error between our control input and the quadcopter\u2019s actual position. The quadcopter would be level when we want it to be pitched forward by five degrees. This is where the PID loop goes to work. It notices, by examining data from the flight controller\u2019s sensors, that the quadcopter\u2019s real orientation does not match the one we commanded the quadcopter to take. So, the PID loop adjusts the lift produced by each of the four rotors in such a way that the real orientation of the quadcopter matches the five degree forward pitch we wanted.  The trick to this process is to make sure that the PID loop does not accidentally overshoot the desired orientation by being overly aggressive when controlling the motors. When the PID loop is too aggressive, the quadcopter will be twitchy and unstable in the air as the PID loop frantically corrects errors and keeps overshooting the desired values. However, we also don\u2019t want the PID loop to be too gentle, which would cause sluggish performance. So we have to strike a balance so that the quadcopter responds quickly to our input without developing instability with rapid, aggressive lift adjustments. In this step, we will adjust settings for the PID loop in order to achieve this balance.  Hopefully that explanation made at least some sense to you so that now you are ready to start tuning the KK2.1 PID loop. The PID loop settings are located in the PI Roll and Pitch menu on the KK2.1. Input the values below. Note that the values for Roll (Aileron) and Pitch (Elevator) are coupled so when you change the values in one of these menus, the values in the other menu change as well.Roll (Aileron)/Pitch (Elevator) PI Settings    P Gain: 50       P Limit: 100       I Gain: 25       I Limit: 20   Yaw (Rudder) PI Settings     P Gain: 55       P Limit: 20       I Gain: 60       I Limit: 10  ", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8E/1REL/HSVTB191/F8E1RELHSVTB191.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY8/MTAC/HSVTB19L/FY8MTACHSVTB19L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLI/T7SQ/HSVTB19N/FLIT7SQHSVTB19N.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 19: PI Roll and Pitch"}, {"step": 20, "steps_text": "The KK2.1 has the ability to automatically keep the quadcopter level as we fly, using the self-level feature. In this step we will set up the self-level feature to optimize the quadcopter\u2019s ability to maintain a level orientation in the air.  There are many things I love about the KK2.1 flight control board including its small and light form factor, the ease with which it can be configured, its versatility, and its self-level feature, which is the subject of this step. When in self-level mode, the KK2.1, as you can probably guess, attempts to keep the quadcopter as level as possible during flight. Self-level is a great feature for people who are new to flying quadcopters as it greatly reduces the chance of losing control and crashing. Flying in self-level mode is also nice for doing aerial photography or videography since it makes the quadcopter a nice, stable platform for your camera.  But, for the self-level feature to work well, we are going to need to customize some settings for the SK450 Dead Cat quadcopter. Fortunately, this step does not require much explanation because what we will actually be doing is calibrating another PID loop like we did in the last step, just this time the PID loop is used for a different purpose.  Self-Level Settings    P Gain: 42       P Limit: 56       ACC Trim Roll: 0       ACC Trim Pitch: -3   Just before we conclude this step, I wanted to include one final bit of theory about the ACC Trim Pitch value. The reason we decreased that value from 0 to -3 has to do with the geometry of our SK450 Dead Cat quadcopter. The difference between a normal X quadcopter and our SK450 Dead Cat quadcopter is in the position of Motor One and Motor Two. Compared with a normal quadcopter, the front arms of our Dead Cat quadcopter are angled back by 25o. The negative ACC Trim Pitch value helps prevent the quadcopter from tipping forward since, relative to a normal quadcopter, there is less lift for the front of the craft. If you mount a heavy camera in the front, you may wish to decrease this value a bit further.\n        ", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FIW/MCYI/HSVTB1D3/FIWMCYIHSVTB1D3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 20: Self-Level Settings"}, {"step": 21, "steps_text": "In this step, we will program the radio transmitter so that the zero-positions of the sticks actually output a zero signal, and the sticks issue commands in the expected directions.  Welcome to the longest step of this entire SK450 Dead Cat quadcopter tutorial. Before we get started, let\u2019s take a second to review the work we\u2019ve done so far: we modified the KK2.1 Mixer Editor settings so that the flight controller knows the positions of the quadcopter\u2019s motors, we modified the PI Roll and Pitch settings so that the quadcopter responds appropriately to our control input, and last, we modified the self-level settings to optimize the quadcopter\u2019s ability to stay level in the air. In this step, we will calibrate our radio transmitter and the flight controller\u2019s receiver settings.  Let\u2019s get started with a tiny bit of theory - don\u2019t worry, this step is much, much simpler than some of the earlier ones in this chapter. There are four different directional controls on our radio transmitter, which you should be familiar with already:\u00a0 throttle, roll, pitch, and yaw. Each of these directional controls has a range of values that depend on the positions of the two sticks on the radio transmitter. This is how we communicate with the quadcopter.  Our goal here is to make sure that when we move the transmitter sticks, the KK2.1 receives commands in the correct directions. In other words, to use an example, when we move the pitch stick up, we want the KK2.1 to detect an upward pitch control, not downward. Chances are though that without setting up the transmitter, at least one of the control inputs will be inverted. To correct this, we will use the Receiver Test tool in the KK2.1 menu. Alright, let's get started. First, turn on your transmitter and, in the KK2.1 menu, select Receiver Test. Try moving the sticks on your transmitter. You should see the values in the Receiver Test screen change as you move the sticks. In the sections below, we will observe these values as we move the sticks and make changes to the transmitter settings as necessary to achieve the correct directions for the controls. One last thing before we get started. There are two sets of buttons on the transmitter that we will use to adjust the transmitter\u2019s settings. First, if you take a look at your transmitter, you will notice a row of six switches below the sticks. These switches are used to reverse the direction of each channel. When we move our sticks, there is a chance that the KK2.1 will read some of our inputs as going in the opposite direction. For example, we might move the rudder stick left, but the KK2.1 will read a right rudder input. In this case we would flip the rudder switch to the opposite position. The second set of switches, of which there are four total, are located below and to the sides of the sticks. We will use these switches to trim the values output by the transmitter so that the minimum values are reached when the sticks are in their minimal positions.Adjusting Throttle Trim and Direction So, start by moving the throttle stick to the bottom position, in other words, move the left stick to the bottom. When you do this, the throttle value in the KK2.1 Receiver Test will change. We will adjust the throttle stick direction and trim value based on the throttle values displayed in the Receiver Test tool. First, if the number goes to some high value around or greater than one-hundred, and displays the word Full, flip the throttle channel switch (thro), which should should change the input to a small number. Otherwise, if, when you move the throttle stick down, the value is already small or zero, leave the switch in its original position. Second, if the throttle value in KK2.1 is greater than zero with the stick at the bottom, click the small switch to the right of the throttle stick down to decrease the value to zero. Otherwise, if the value is zero, click the switch to the right of the throttle stick up until you see a value of one, and then click the switch down once to set the value to zero. The point here is to make sure that, when the throttle stick is at the bottom, the KK2.1 reads a value of exactly zero. You will also see the word Idle displayed next to the value.Adjusting the Yaw (Rudder) Trim and Direction We will use the same procedure for setting the trim value and direction of the yaw stick that we used for the throttle stick. So, move the yaw stick (left stick) to the far left and observe the readings in the Receiver Test tool. First, if you see a negative number, or the word Right, flip the rudder (rudd) switch to change the direction of the output. This should cause the value in the Receiver Test change to some positive number. Keep in mind that for yaw controls, moving the stick left should yield a positive value in the Receiver Test tool, and moving the stick right should yield a negative reading. This is a little counterintuitive and can be confusing. The reason for this convention is because a right yaw input causes the quadcopter to rotate clockwise, and clockwise rotation is usually denoted by a positive value. Second we will adjust the trim value of the yaw input. If you take your thumb completely off the left stick, it should snap to the middle, where we want a rudder value of zero. If, in the Receiver Test screen, you see a positive value, click the yaw trim button, located below the left stick, to the right until you achieve a reading of zero. Otherwise, if the reading displayed is negative, click the trim button to the left until the reading reaches zero.Adjusting the Pitch (Elevator) Trim and Direction Now that you are getting the hang of adjusting trim and direction settings, let\u2019s move on to the elevator stick, which adjusts the pitch of the quadcopter. Before we begin, like with the yaw values, the pitch values can be a bit confusing. Pushing the stick forward gives a negative reading and pulling the stick back gives a positive value. So start by moving the elevator stick all the way down. In the Receiver Test tool, you should see a positive value and the word Back. If you see a negative value, flip the elevator (elev) switch. Like we did with the rudder stick, now let the elevator stick go and it will snap to the middle. If you see a positive value in the Receiver Test tool, click the elevator trim button, located to the left of the stick, to the down until you get a value of zero. Otherwise, if you see a negative value, click the trim button up to get a value of zero.Adjust the Roll (Aileron) Trim and Direction Now for the last control direction. The roll stick should yield a positive value to the right, and display the word Right, and a negative value to the left, along with the word Left. If you get the opposite values when you move the aileron stick, flip the aileron (aile) direction switch. Then, release the stick and adjust the trim button, located below the stick, to achieve a value of zero in the Receiver Test tool when the stick is centered.\n        ", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F0N/SRJW/HSVTB1FG/F0NSRJWHSVTB1FG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 21: Receiver Test"}, {"step": 22, "steps_text": "The sensor test is a quick diagnostic procedure that makes sure that the sensors onboard the KK2.1 are functioning correctly.  We\u2019ve been working hard programming all of the many settings in the KK2.1 needed to optimize the flight performance of our SK450 Dead Cat quadcopter. I think it is time for a nice easy step. Before we fly our quadcopter for the first time, it is a good precaution to make sure that all of the sensors onboard the KK2.1 are functioning correctly. This will hopefully help prevent the quadcopter from going crazy on takeoff and damaging itself or something else.  So, in the KK2.1 menu, navigate to the Sensor Test tool and press the Enter button. The KK2.1 has two types of sensors onboard: a 3-axis gyroscope, which senses the rotation of the craft around the roll, pitch, and yaw axes, and a 3-axis accelerometer, which senses acceleration of the craft in all three directions. The Sensor Test tool should list the three axes for these two sensors. You should, hopefully, see that the status for all six lines is listed as \u201cOK.\u201d  It is probably a good idea to run this sensor test from time to time, especially after a crash. Unfortunately, if, for whatever reason, one or more of your sensors fails the test, you don\u2019t really have any options other than replacing the KK2.1 board. If your board is brand new, you should return it.

The accelerometer sense acceleration of the craft, and the direction of gravity. In this step, we will calibrate this second piece of information, so that the KK2.1 knows which direction is down.  Since we just used to Sensor Test tool to verify that all of the sensors onboard the KK2.1 flight controller are functioning as expected, we will now need to calibrate the accelerometer.  Ready for one more bit of theory before we are done programming the KK2.1? I think it is worth knowing a bit about how accelerometers work before we calibrate the one on the flight control board. First of all, accelerometers are devices that sense acceleration forces. They can detect two different types of acceleration: static acceleration forces caused by the Earth\u2019s gravity, and dynamic acceleration forces caused by movement. So when we calibrate our accelerometer, we are giving it a zero reference so that the sensor knows what direction is down (the direction of gravity).  The KK2.1 can then talk to the accelerometer to figure out which direction is down and it can combine this information with data from the gyroscope, and data about the quadcopter\u2019s movement-related acceleration to determine exactly how the quadcopter is oriented in three-dimensional space.  Let\u2019s calibrate the accelerometer. The most critical part of this process is setting up our calibration environment correctly. In order to calibrate our accelerometer, we need the quadcopter to be completely level and on a solid surface. So, using a bubble level, find some solid surface in your work area that is completely level. It is worth the extra effort to make sure the surface is level because if you calibrate your accelerometers while the quadcopter is in a non-level position, your quadcopter will probably drift around in the air, making it more difficult to fly. Avoid using a wiggly table or a swiveling stool or something because if you quadcopter moves during the accelerometer calibration process it will throw off the accuracy of the calibration.  So, place the quadcopter on your chosen level surface. Then, in the KK2.1 menu, scroll down to the ACC Calibration tool, and click the Enter button. The KK2.1 will tell you to place the quadcopter on a level surface, which we\u2019ve done already, so press the Enter button again. The KK2.1 will then go through the calibration process, which takes eight seconds or so. Make sure you do not bump the quadcopter or the table during this process.

In this step we will achieve this balance.  We are just about ready to fly. We only have two components left add attach to the quadcopter (excluding optional components like a camera): the battery and the props. We will get to the props in the next step, in this step we will attach the battery. There is a good reason why we saved the battery for this step. Since the battery is by far the heaviest part of the quadcopter, we can use its bulk to balance the craft.  Balancing the quadcopter, both side to side and front to back, is very important for a number of reasons. First, balancing the quadcopter makes it more stable during flight since it won\u2019t be constantly trying to flip over or drift. Second, balancing the quadcopter extends the life of the battery since the motors will not have to fight against the craft flipping over. Third, a balanced quadcopter, by virtue of it being more stable, makes a better camera platform. And last, in the event of a crash, a balanced quadcopter will be less likely to crash upside-down and damage the flight controller.  Luckily, balancing the quadcopter is not too difficult. To start with, since we assembled our quadcopter symmetrically around the roll axis, it should be balanced side to side automatically. Balancing the quadcopter front to back will involve moving the battery forwards and backwards until the position at which it balances the quadcopter is found.  In order to test the balance, place the quadcopter on some kind of narrow support, like the edge of a board, or a pipe, or something similar. I used a part of my toolbox because it was handy. With your support selected choose a random starting position for the battery. Attach the battery to the bottom of the quadcopter using zip-ties. Keep the zip-ties loose enough that you can slide the battery forwards and backwards to adjust the balance point of the craft.  One last thing, if you plan to attach a camera to your SK450 Dead Cat quadcopter, you should attach it in the proper position while you try to balance the craft, otherwise, when you put the camera on later, the quadcopter will become unbalanced. So with your quadcopter set up as it will be when you fly it, move the battery forwards and backwards until the quadcopter stops tipping one way or the other on its support when you let it go.  I found that, without a camera, the correct position for the battery was right in the middle, directly below the flight controller. With the camera (I use a Contour ROAM) installed on the camera shelf on the front of the SK450 Dead Cat, I found the correct position of the battery to be almost at the back.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F32/IEF8/HSVTB1N5/F32IEF8HSVTB1N5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F61/3NUP/HSVTB28M/F613NUPHSVTB28M.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 24: Balance Quadcopter"}, {"step": 25, "steps_text": "Balancing the quadcopter props is an extremely important step in minimizing the vibrations produced by the spinning motors. Minimizing vibration improves battery life, the life of the craft itself, and video quality.  Now the only components left to attach to the quadcopter are the props. Before we attach the props to the motors though, we need to balance the props. By balance the props, I mean we need to make sure that each blade weighs exactly the same. Unbalanced props cause three main issues during flight. First, unbalanced props can cause intense vibration since the props spin extremely fast. This vibration can interfere with the accelerometer as well as loosen screws or damage components. Second, if you are doing aerial videography with your quadcopter, the vibrations caused by unbalanced props will cause the infamous jello effect in your video (or, to use the correct terminology, the rolling shutter effect). Third and last, since some of the energy put into the motors is wasted on vibration when you quadcopter has unbalanced props, balancing the props can increase battery life slightly.  To balance our props, we will use a special tool called, unsurprisingly, a prop balancer. A prop balancer consists of a metal shaft suspended by two magnets. By using magnetic suspension, there is practically zero friction, which means, when we test our props, even the slightest difference in the weight of the two sides of the prop will be noticeable.  Let\u2019s balance our props. First, select one of the props and mount it in the prop balancer by slipping the metal shaft through the hole in the prop and sliding the rubber pieces to the middle so that the prop will be held in the center of the shaft. Then, hold the prop in a horizontal position and, taking care that your fingers do not bump the the prop one way or the other, carefully let the prop go. Unless your prop is already balanced, which, unless you opted to by very high quality props, is unlikely, one side of the prop should fall. Repeat this test several times to make sure the result is reliable. The side of the prop that falls is, obviously, the heavier side. So, cut a very small piece of electrical tape and apply it to the light side (the side that went up) of the prop. Then re-test the balance of your prop. If the original heavy side still falls, move the piece of tape further from the center of the prop. Otherwise, if the side to which you applied tape now falls, move the tape closer to the hub, or cut it smaller.  It will probably take some fiddling, even quite a lot of fiddling, but you will know your prop is balanced when, after positioning the prop horizontally and letting it go, it does not move at all. Then, repeat this process for the other three props, and, if you are not terribly bored with prop balancing already, balance some spare props so that if one of your props breaks in the field, you can immediately replace it and keep flying.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F03/RO2H/HSVTB1OE/F03RO2HHSVTB1OE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBD/6AE5/HSVTB1OX/FBD6AE5HSVTB1OX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6I/EGT4/HSVTB1OZ/F6IEGT4HSVTB1OZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKS/U2QW/HSVTB1PI/FKSU2QWHSVTB1PI.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 25: Balance Props"}, {"step": 26, "steps_text": "In this step we will attach the balanced props to the motors.  Well, it has been a long journey but we are finally on the very last step before we get to fly. The last thing we need to do is attach the props to the motors.  Unfortunately, this isn't quite as easy as it sounds. You see, we have two different types of props, ones made to turn clockwise, and ones made to turn counter-clockwise, and both of these types of props look pretty much exactly the same. To figure out which props to go on which motors, we will first need to recall the direction each motors spins. So, remembering that the motors are numbered clockwise around the craft, with Motor One in the front-left, Motor Two in the front-right, Motor Three in the rear-right, and Motor Four in the rear-left, the rotations directions are as follows:   Motor One \u2192 Clockwise     Motor Two \u2192 Counter-clockwise     Motor Three \u2192 Clockwise     Motor Four \u2192 Counter-clockwise   Now let's match up the props. First of all, on one side of each prop, you should notice a bit of writing. We will mount all of the props with the writing side up. In order to provide lift instead of upward thrust, which would force the quadcopter into the ground, the blades should spin so that the wider part goes forward. Take a look at the pictures below for clarification. So match up each prop with a motor that spins in the correct direction.  To attach the props to the motors, we will need to use prop adapters since the hole in the prop is far larger than the motor shaft. Fortunately, the props came with prop adapters in a variety of sizes. So just figure out which size is correct for the motors by testing out each adapter. With four prop adapters on hand and the propellers matched up with the correct motors, we can start mounting the props.  The first step is to take the nuts off all four motors. Then, put a prop adapter onto each motor, followed by a matched prop, and finally screw the nut back on.  Once you have all four props attached and you have tightened the nuts until they are very snug, we will need to verify that the motors themselves spin in the correct direction. First of all, memorize the directions in motors are supposed to spin (see the list above). Then, press the back button three times until the KK2.1 is back on the home screen. Turn on your transmitter and arm the quadcopter by moving the left stick to the bottom-right position.  Now, using short little bursts of throttle, look at the direction each motor spins. If any of the motors spin in the wrong direction, first disarm the quadcopter and disconnect the battery. Then, simply swap any two of the motor connection wires to change the rotation direction.  \u00a0", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FUD/K6LF/HSVTB1R0/FUDK6LFHSVTB1R0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNA/XLQ9/HSVTB1RL/FNAXLQ9HSVTB1RL.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 26: Attach the Props to the Motors"}, {"step": 27, "steps_text": "Congratulations!

Now go fly!", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 27: Congratulations"}, {"step": 28, "steps_text": "Every quadcopter flies just a little bit differently so you will need to tune your quadcopter's settings. This page goes over the basics of quadcopter tuning. Actually building your quadcopter only gets you part of the way towards successfully flying and shooting great aerial photos and videos. You will need to tune your quadcopter's settings in order to optimize its flight characteristics. Specifically, you will need to tune your \"PI Roll and Pitch\" settings. The settings covered in step 19 of this Instructable should get your quadcopter flying fairly well, but again, every quadcopter flies a bit differently and every pilot controls their quadcopter a bit differently. The key to successfully tuning your quadcopter, and I doubt this will be surprising to you, is knowing what each of the flight controller's settings do. Now, I don't want to go into tons of math or electrical engineering to explain the actual inner workings of a flight controller's PID loop in this step. If you want to learn how PID loops work, there is plenty of information out there that you can access with a quick Google search. In this step I just want to cover how each parameter in your flight controller's PID loop settings affects the quadcopter's performance.P Gain   The P Gain (which stands for Proportional Gain) parameter basically controls how your quadcopter prioritizes pilot input versus input from the flight controller's onboard sensors.  A high value of the P Gain parameter means that the readings from the sensors will be very important. A low value of the P Gain means that pilot input will be very important.  If the P Gain is set too high, you might notice the quadcopter oscillating or kind of twitching in the air. This effect is caused by the flight controller's frantic attempts to correct even the tiniest sensor discrepancies. If the P Gain is set too low, the craft will seem sluggish and slow to react to changes in orientation on control input. It will probably be difficult to keep the quadcopter airborne if the P Gain is too low since the quadcopter will be expecting you, the pilot, to do most of the work needed to keep and craft stable, and unfortunately, our brains and our thumbs are just not quick enough to make the rapid adjustments needed to keep the craft in the air.  \u00a0I Gain   The I Gain (which stands for Integral Gain) controls how quickly the quadcopter will respond to changes in angular orientation.  In other words, let's say you are flying your quadcopter and you want it to move forward. To do this, we tilt the quadcopter forward. This forward tilt directs some of the quadcopter's lift backwards instead of all the lift being directed downwards, which makes the quadcopter move forward. When we release the stick, the quadcopter will return to a level position.  Neither the tilting forward nor the returning to a level position happen instantly though. It obviously takes a little time for the quadcopter to actually move. The I Gain basically controls how aggressively the quadcopter attempts to achieve the designated tilt.  If the I Gain value is too low, the quadcopter will see sluggish and slow to respond to control input. If the I Gain is too high, the quadcopter will again oscillate in the air as it fights to keep a perfect position.Tuning P Gain  Starting with the values suggested in step 19 of this Instructable, if you feel like your quadcopter is a bit too sluggish, turn up the P Gain in intervals of five until you get the responsiveness you want. If you notice your quadcopter oscillating in the air, back the P Gain off a bit.Tuning I Gain\u00a0  Starting with the values suggested in step 19 of this Instructable, if you notice your quadcopter does not stop and stabilize after moving the sticks and returning them to center, increase the I Gain increments of five until you get a quicker response time. You want to get to a point where the quadcopter returns to a level position quickly and does not wander around in the air.  The I Gain value is also useful if you are flying in windy conditions where it is more important for the quadcopter to correct its angular position and not get moved around by the wind as much.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 28: Tuning Your Quadcopter"}, {"step": 29, "steps_text": "  Connect Battery to Charger Battery technology is great, as it allows us to bring a portable power source anywhere we go, including high into the sky. The unfortunate downside to battery technology is that batteries go flat after being used for a while; you already know this. Never fear though, this appendix to the SK340 Dead Cat quadcopter build tutorial Instructable will show you how to safely charge your batteries using the Accucel-6 charger. The first step is to connect your battery to the charger. So, take a look at your battery and you will notice that there are two sets of wires coming out one end: the thick red/black set that we use to connect the battery to the quadcopter, and a set of four thinner colored wires with a thin plug at the end. We will plug both sets of wires into the Accucel-6 charger. First, included with the charger were several wire adapters with red and black plugs on one end, and a variety of connectors on the other end. Locate the adapter with an XT60 plug on the end, this is the plug that matches the red/black plug on the battery. Next, on the right side of the Accucel-6, you will notice a red port and a black port. Connect the red and black plugs on the battery adapter into the matching colored ports on the Accucel-6. Now plug the XT60 plugs on the battery and on the battery adapter together. Now let\u2019s plug in the set of colored wires from the battery.Take a look at the right side of the Accucel-6 again and you will notice a bank of white female connectors with pins in them. Notice that each connector has a different number of pins. Now shift your attention to the group of four colored wires from the battery, notice that the connector at the end has four male pins. You can probably guess what we\u2019ll do next. Connect the white battery plug to the slot on the Accucel-6 that has four pins.  Program Charger With the battery connected to the Accucel-6 charger, we now need to set up the charger to use the correct settings for charging our battery. Before we begin this process, I want to make a very important safety note: it is absolutely imperative that you use the correct settings for charging your battery. Failure to charge the battery with the correct settings could result in damage to the battery, the charger, or even catastrophic failure of the battery which could result in a fire/explosion. Also, during charging, always put your battery in a LiPo bag, which is a fire-proof bag designed to contain any battery failure. You should also never leave a battery unattended while it is charging. I certainly do not wish to scare you with this information, but lithium polymer batteries are capable of high discharge rates and are made with some pretty volatile ingredients, like lithium, and it is important to be safe. In reality, if you handle, charge, and discharge the batteries with some care, you will be just fine. LiPo batteries almost never fail the way you see in some videos on YouTube. So with the safety information out of the way, lets get started setting up the Accucel-6 to charge our battery. First, we will need to gather some information about the battery, which should be printed on the battery\u2019s label, otherwise you can obtain information from the manufacturer\u2019s documentation. The information we will need is:\u00a0 the number of cells in the battery, the voltage of the battery, and the maximum charge current of the battery. For the Turnigy 2200mAh 3S 20C Lipo Pack used in the SK450 Dead Cat quadcopter tutorial, the information we will need is as follows: Number of cells: 3 Voltage: 11.1V Maximum charge current: 2.2 Amps The first two pieces of information here, the number of cells and the voltage of the battery are easy to find, they are written right on the battery label. The third bit of information, the maximum charge rate, requires a little bit of math to figure out though, which I will take a moment to explain. First of all, calculating the maximum charging current requires two other pieces of information: the battery\u2019s capacity, and the maximum charging rate of the battery. The battery\u2019s capacity is written right on the battery label. The battery\u2019s capacity is expressed in units of milliamp hours (mAh), which basically describes how much power a battery can supply for how long. The capacity of the battery used in the SK450 Dead Cat quadcopter tutorial is 2200mAh. As for the maximum charge rate for the battery, the maximum safe charge rate for our LiPo battery is 1C. Here, the C stands for coulombs, which is basically a unit of electrical charge. This is probably a slower rate\u00a0 that you could technically pump into the battery, but we want to make absolutely certain that the battery does not start on fire, so we will go with the safe rate of 1C. From the battery\u2019s capacity, and the maximum charge rate of 1C, we can calculate the maximum charging current of our battery. First of all though, charging current is expressed in units of Amps. To find the maximum charging current for our battery, we will multiply the battery\u2019s capacity in amp-hours by the maximum charging rate in coulombs. First, move the decimal point in the 2200mAh capacity listed on the battery label three spots to the left to convert from milliamp hours to amp hours. We end up with 2.2Ah. So, multiplying this figure by the maximum charging capacity of 1C, we end up with a maximum charging current of 2.2A. So now that we did all that work and all that math, I am going to tell you that, unless you are in a big hurry, you should probably not charge the battery at the full 2.2A charging current. It will prolong the life of the battery if you charge at a lower rate. So in this tutorial we will use a charging current of 1A. Now let\u2019s finally get to programming the Accucel-6. First of all, plug in your 12V power adapter to the plug on the left side of the Accucel-6. As soon as you connect the power, the Accucel-6 will emit a loud beep. You should get used to these extremely loud beeps as the charger will be deeping a lot in the next few minutes. After the Turnigy splash screen goes away, you will be presented with a screen with \u201cPROGRAM SELECT\u201d in the first line and a battery type in the second line. If the battery type listed in the second line is anything but \u201cLiPo BATT,\u201d press the leftmost \u201cType\u201d button to change the battery type. Once you have \u201cLiPo BATT\u201d in the second line, press the right-most \u201cEnter\u201d button. On the next screen, the first line lists what action the Accucel-6 is taking. The device is capable of charging the battery, balancing the battery, fast-charging the battery, storing the battery, and discharging the battery. These functions are all useful and some are covered in other tutorials on this site, but for now, use the middle two arrow buttons to select \u201cLiPo CHARGE\u201d since we are interested in charging the battery right now. The second line lists settings for the charging process, from left to right the settings are: charging current battery voltage (battery cell count) To change these settings, press the Enter button. The charging current setting should now be flashing. Use the arrow buttons to set the charging current to 1.0A. Now press the Enter button again to select the battery voltage/cell count setting. Use the arrow buttons again until \u201c11.1V(3S)\u201d is selected. With the correct settings applied, we are finally ready to charge the battery.  Charge the Battery To start the charging process, hold the Enter button for three seconds. The Accucel-6 will beep a few times and then it will check the battery. After a couple seconds, a you will be presented with a new screen. The first line lists the settings you entered on the right, and the settings detected by the Accucel-6 on the left. If these settings do not match, press the leftmost \u201cBack\u201d button to return to the previous screen and double-check your settings. Otherwise, if the settings on the top line to match, press the Enter button to start charging. The Accucel-6 will display the status of the charging progress. It lists the battery type and cell count, the current charging current, the current battery voltage, the charging time, and the battery capacity. Now you just need to wait for the battery to finish charging. Remember never to leave the battery unattended while charging. If you have to leave before the charging process is complete, stop the process by pressing the left-most \u201cStop\u201d button.

Introduction  When you place an order for a KK2.1 flight control board somebody goes into a HobbyKing warehouse somewhere, finds a KK2.1 on a shelf, puts it in a box, and sends it to you. The problem is, like most electronic devices, the software installed on the KK2.1 evolves over time - bugs get fixed, features get added, algorithms get optimized, ect. - and depending on how long the particular KK2.1 board you get has been sitting in the warehouse, its software is probably out of date.By upgrading the software (called firmware) on your KK2.1 board, you can improve the performance of your multirotor, as updated firmware has more advanced control code. For example, the auto-leveling algorithms on the newest KK2.1 firmware are far superior to the ones that come with firmware version 1.5, which is the firmware installed on most KK2.1 boards when you order them. So by updating the firmware, your multirotor will fly much better in auto-level mode for example. So, let's get to the firmware update setup. Determining Current Firmware Version  As mentioned above, the firmware installed on your KK2.1 board when it arrives in the mail may or may not be out of date. This is especially true if you purchase your KK2.1 secondhand on eBay or somewhere; the previous owner might have already updated the firmware. Fortunately, discovering what firmware version is installed on your KK2.1 is really easy. When you first apply power to your KK2.1 board, either with a battery or with a USBasp programmer (more on that in a second) a screen will flash across the screen that displays the current hardware and firmware versions. You might have to unplug and replug your KK2.1 a few times to read the firmware version as it only displays on the screen for part of a second, but you are going to look at the second line in the splash screen, which says \"FW: ###\". That  number is the firmware version currently running on your KK2.1. Hardware Needed You will only need two pieces of hardware to update the firmware on your KK2.1 board:A USBasp programmer: a USB in-circuit programmer for Atmel AVR controllers, of which the KK2.1 flight control board is one (the popular Arduino microcontroller is another).A 10-pin to 6-pin AVR programming cable: this cable is an adapter that goes between the 10-pin interface on the USBasp programmer and the 6-pin interface on the KK2.1 board.You can order both of these parts in a single package from HobbyKing, although there are many other places you can buy them, including Amazon, eBay, or SparkFun. Software Needed On the software side, we are very fortunate to have fabulous and generous programmers in the multirotor community who donate their time an energy to create easy-to-use software tools for updating the KK2.1 firmware. The software I like best was created by \"Kapteinkuk\" and \"Lazyzero.\" The \"KKmulticoper Flashtool\" they created provides a graphical interface for updating the firmware on the KK2.1 board, along with a host of other boards. To download the software:Go to http://lazyzero.de/en/modellbau/kkmulticopterflashtool.Scroll down to the download section.Download the \"Latest stable software versions\" for your OS.Now, if you are on Mac OS X, you are ready to start updating your firmware, just skip to the next step. If you are on Windows (like me), you will also need to download the driver software for the USBasp programmer: Head over to http://www.fischl.de/usbasp/ and scroll down to the \"Drivers\" section. Download the .zip file containing the latest USBasp driver. Go to wherever you just downloaded the .zip file and extract it. Remember the location of this file because we will use it at the beginning of the next step. See you there.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ1/9WPD/HXUCTGSB/FQ19WPDHXUCTGSB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F80/A71S/HXUCTGSN/F80A71SHXUCTGSN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTY/8E1V/HXUCTGT3/FTY8E1VHXUCTGT3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 30: Appendix B:  Updating the KK2.1 Firmware - Setup"}, {"step": 31, "steps_text": "   In this step we will update the firmware on the KK2.1 flight controller board.  Plug in your KK2.1 We will start by plugging the KK2.1 board into our computer via the USBasp programmer.First, plug the 10-pin end of the programming cable into the USBasp programmer board. Second, plug the USB end of the USBasp programmer into an available USB port on your computer.Now, the third and last step is to plug the 6-pin side of the ASP programming cable into the KK2.1 board. However, the direction of the cable does matter. Fortunately, it is easy to figure out if you have the cable the wrong way, and if you accidentally do plug in the cable the wrong direction, don't worry, no harm will befall your KK2.1 board. So, when you plug the 6-pin side of the ASP programming cable into the KK2.1 board, you should see the KK2.1's screen light up and display the \"SAFE\" screen. If your KK2.1 does not light up, you have the cable on backwards, so just turn it 180o and everything will be fine.For Windows users, there is one last thing to do. When you plug in your KK2.1, you will probably notice a message appear on your computer informing you that Windows is attempting to install the driver for your new device. Despite its best efforts, Windows will fail at this task and we will have to give it some help by locating the USBasp driver we downloaded in the previous step:Go to your start menu and type \"device manager.\" Then open the Device Manager, which should be the first item in the list of programs.In the Device Manager, you should see section called \"Other Devices\" and if you expand this section, you should find an entry called \"USBasp.\"The little yellow exclamation mark means something has gone wrong, namely the driver failed to load, so right-click on the USBasp entry and from the menu, choose \"Update driver software...\"From the dialog box that appears, choose \"Browse my computer for driver software.\"On the next screen, click the \"Browser...\" button.Locate the USBasp driver folder we downloaded in the previous step, select it, and click \"Ok\"Finally, click next, and Windows will install the USBasp driver software and now we are ready to move on. Update your Firmware At long last it is finally time to do the actual firmware updating. So start by running the KKmulticopter Flashtool we downloaded in the previous step (it usually takes ten seconds or so to start). There are a total of five fields in the KKmulticopter Flashtool software we will need to set for the firmware update to work.In the \"programmer\" field, choose \"USBasp\"In the \"port\" field, choose \"usb\"In the \"controller\" field choose \"HobbyKing 22.1 and KK2.1.\"In the \"Flashing firmware\" box, under the \"Repository\" tab, choose \"KK2.1\" from the first dropdown menu. Just a bit of explanation here: there are two ways to update the firmware on your KK2.1, you can either choose a firmware file from your computer, or you can let the software retrieve the best firmware from the repository managed by Lazyzero. This second option is much easier. At the time of this writing, the best firmware available is the \"KK2.1 V1.9S1 by Steveis\" but when you update your firmware an even better version may be available.Finally, with all the fields set, click the green button on the right side of the Flashing firmware area. The firmware update process can take 20 to 30 seconds or so but eventually you should see a message in the KKmulticopter flashtool indicating that the firmware flashing process was successful.Congratulations, you have successfully updated your KK2.1 firmware.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FU7/6Z4D/HXUCTYZB/FU76Z4DHXUCTYZB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F42/GNWA/HXUCTYZO/F42GNWAHXUCTYZO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYC/GA4E/HXUCTYXL/FYCGA4EHXUCTYXL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8K/0UB1/HXUCTYWB/F8K0UB1HXUCTYWB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUA/KIUT/HXUCU22L/FUAKIUTHXUCU22L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCO/JWNB/HXUCU212/FCOJWNBHXUCU212.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 31: Appendix B:  Updating the KK2.1 Firmware - Updating"}], "channel": "Remote Control"}, {"category": "technology", "description": "Hi AllI'm starting something new today and hope that you find it interesting.This is the first step in a long term project which will result in something really really nice :)You can read all about it at:  http://dosimplecarbon.com, go to The Project section, and if you are really interested you can subscribe to to the updates letter.This instructable is an adaptation of  http://dosimplecarbon.com/calculating-loads/,  here I can be a little more technical :)Let's start and I hope you enjoy it,Dani", "title": "How to Calculate Loads on Your Skateboard Frame", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Calculate-Loads-on-Your-Skateboard-Frame/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "When designing a structure, one has to understand the conditions at which this structure will operate. Let\u2019s take our case for example, we  want to design a skateboard frame. This frame, or deck, is attached to  the wheels and a person is standing on top of it. The whole thing is  moving and occasionally meets various bumps on the road. It will see  dirt and rain and some kind of abuse during its life span.What should we do with this information? To begin with, let\u2019s assume  that anything, which is not made of paper or glass, will handle rain and  dirt and moderate abuse just fine. This leaves us with the weight of  the person and the actual riding and meeting various stuff during this  ride. Now it is just a matter of translating this to the loads that the  frame sees.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: What Are We Dealing With?"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Let us make further assumptions: the maximum weight of this person is 120 kg (264 lb) and he/she can stand on this skateboard in two ways \u2013 in  the middle of the board on one leg (I know, not very realistic) and on  two legs, when each leg is at one third of the board. The picture really  describes this much clearer. In the first case the entire weight will be  applied in the middle, in the second case the weight will be equally  divided between two points. L will be the length of the frame between  the two wheel trucks.In nature everything is in balance, just look around you. What does it mean in our case? It simply means that when we apply the loads on the  frame, there will be an equal and opposite forces that will balance  these loads, these are called reactions. It is easy to understand that  these reactions will occur at the point where the wheels meet the  ground. For start, and because we are dealing with the frame for now,  let\u2019s not be concerned with the trucks and the wheels, they will be  considered later.How is the frame held by the wheels? If we stand on it or push it to  the ground, the wheels will support us without any problem. But, if we  take it from either side and try to flip it either way, we can easily do  so. This kind of support is called \u201csimple support\u201d. We can of course  meet it in other places in our life, consider for example this railroad  bridge that I came across in Hillsborough, NC:https://www.instagram.com/p/BUFVClCFQg-/?taken-by=...Note the pivot and the massive pin on the left bottom of the upper picture, another one exists on the other side. Consider what this bridge  can experience during its life: ground movement, uneven sinking of the  ground, all these trains passing on it\u2026 Now, look at this from the  perspective of these hinges: they will always support it vertically, but  will take all this relative motion without any trouble \u2013 it will simply  adjust its rotational position. The same happens with our skateboard  frame.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FMR/FH5P/J34PHUFO/FMRFH5PJ34PHUFO.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Further Assumptions and Simple Support"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Now let\u2019s draw it again in a much simpler manner, see first picture.At this phase we are less concerned with the actual shape of our frame but rather the loads and the reactions which act on it. It is easy to see  that in our case the reaction at each wheel truck will be 60 kg for both  cases \u2013 just consider symmetry and the total applied load. So, what will  be the difference between these two load cases? To answer this we need  to go deeper and understand what are the local loads at each point on  the frame are.The local loads in our case are of two types \u2013 shear forces and  bending moments. Both of them result due to the loads and the reactions  on the frame. Shear forces are simply the vertical loads that act on the  frame, and bending moments are simple force multiplied by the arm (distance) to the point. Bending moments are more significant to the structure, shear forces usually do not influence the design. The  calculation in both cases is very simple, we start from left to right  and sum up all the loads that come by, we are using the sections method here. See the pictures for the actual  numbers. x-axis is the longitudinal coordinate along the frame, it changes between 0 and  the length of the board.Why two board lengths?For this project I bought a longboard for myself to practice riding (I never rode before) and to have a reference structure for everything that  we are doing here. My longboard is 42\u201d (105 cm) long with 34\u201d (86 cm)  distance between the wheels. During my riding practice I didn\u2019t see the  need to go further than around 27\u201d (69 cm) between the wheels, my legs  are distanced less apart.

By proportional I mean you don\u2019t want to choose too big or small prop for your airplane.Now, determining the size of propeller sure requires some maths. But you do not need to worry about determining prop size unless you want to design your own RC airplane. Anyways, you can always use e-calculators.I used eCalc to determine the size of propeller.This airplane has a wing span of 20 inches that requires a 5-6 inch prop. Now, I think 5-inch prop works best. Where 5 inch is the diameter of the propeller. Also, the airplane is for beginners and we do not want a massive amount of thrust. So, we\u2019ll use a 5.0-inch prop with a 3.0-inch pitch.What do the numbers on a propeller mean?Suppose a propeller is labeled a X b. Here, \u2018a\u2019 represents the diameter of the propeller in inches and b represents pitch of the propeller in inches. Where pitch is the distance that the propeller is going to move forward during one revolution (Under perfect conditions).So for this airplane, we will use a 5.0 X 3.0 propeller. Simply, a 5030 propeller. Combine this propeller with a powerful motor to meet the  thrust to weight ratio.Thrust to weight ratio?Well, keeping the weight of the airplane you are building in mind, you need to supply a motor and prop powerful and big enough to pull your airplane into the air. Typically it\u2019s 1:1 normally to 1:4 for slow-flyer. For example, if your airplane weighs 400 gm. For, 1:1 thrust to weight ratio you need a motor and prop producing a minimum thrust of 400 gm.Once you know the average weight of your airplane, look for a motor and propeller combination that at least meets 1:1 thrust to weight ratio. If the design of airplane is efficient enough, it flies great even with a small amount of thrust. But, remember this was just a general statement to give an idea of thrust to weight ratio.MotorsType of motors used on RC airplanes:We use brushless motors in RC airplanes these motors are highly efficient and are lightweight as compared to brushed motors. Brushless motors are classified on the basis of their size and rotational speed.What does the numbers on a motor mean?The first set of number is a 4 digit number or 2 two digit numbers separated by a dash \u201c\u2013\u201c. The first two digits number is diameter (in mm) and the second two digits number is the height of the motor (in mm).The second set of numbers represents KV. Or, at how many RPMs the motor is going to rotate when powered through 1V. So, if you have a 2280 KV motor running at 11.1 Volts your motor is running at 2280 X 11.1 = 25308 RPM.Choosing the motor:With the battery and electronics our airplane will weigh about 290 grams. So, we\u2019ll be using a EMAX MT1806 2280 KV brushless motor. This motor produces 380 grams of thrust with 5030 prop at 11.1 Volts. This amount of thrust is good enough for this design. (In the build I\u2019m using the same motor from a local manufacturer.)Find how much thrust your motor produces:Motor manufacturers provide datasheets along with the motors. Here you can find how much thrust your motor is going to generate with a particular propeller and battery. Refer to the datasheet of EMAX MT1806  here.ESCMoving on to powering the motor, Brushless motors require ESCs or, Electronic Speed Controller that converts DC current from your battery to AC current going to your motor because, Brushless motors operates on AC current.ESC also controls the speed of motor through its servo lead and provides 5V DC power for your receiver that controls all your electronics. Now, ESCs are able to provide 5V DC power for radio receiver using a  BEC or a Battery Elimination Circuit . So, that you do not need two separate batteries for your motor and your radio receiver.Choosing ESC:ESCs are classified on how many amps. of current they are going to supply to your motor. So, an ESC that\u2019s rated 10 A is going to supply a maximum of 10 A current to your motor (Safely). Once you know which motor and propeller to use, refer to the datasheet of your motor and find out how much current your motor is going to draw.Now, for safety reasons we always choose an ESC that\u2019s rated 5-10 amperes more than the requirement of a motor at full throttle. This will make sure that the ESC is running cool and you don\u2019t need to worry about heating inside your airplane.By referring to the datasheet provided for EMAX MT1806, I found that the motor will be drawing 8 A of current from the ESC when working with 5030 prop and 3s li-po battery at full throttle. Considering safety for ESC and to run it cool we\u2019ll be using a 20 A ESC.BatteryNow, as already mentioned we\u2019ll be using a 3s li-po battery. Also, we do not want to make our airplane heavy. So, use a 1000mAh 30C 3s li-po battery. Li-po batteries are rechargeable batteries that require a special charger for battery\u2019s long life called a Balance Charger. Any other attempts of careless charging can not only damage your battery. But, can even lead to explosion in battery!What does the numbers on a Li-Po battery mean?Li-Po batteries are labeled with \u201cmAh\u201d, \u201cS ratings\u201d and \u201cC ratings\u201d.mAh stands for milliampere\u2013hour; This represents the capacity of the battery.\u2018S rating\u2019 shows the number of cells that your battery has. If your battery has 3 cells then you get a voltage of 3 X 3.7 V across the terminals of a battery (under perfect circumstances).'C rating\u2019 of the battery explains how many amps of current can be drawn continuously from the battery without damaging it.ServoMoving onto servos, Servos moves the control surfaces on a RC airplane to control altitude or direction of the airplane. For this airplane, we obviously require 2 servos. One to control the altitude and another to control direction. I\u2019m using 2 X 9g digital nylon geared servos.Transmitter and ReceiverFinally, we need a Transmitter and Receiver for controlling the airplane.Channels on the Transmitter and receiver:Channels on the Transmitter and receiver decide how many functions or controls you get. For this airplane, we need 3 channels. That is Throttle, Rudder and Elevator. Where throttle controls the speed of the airplane, Rudder controls the direction and Elevator controls the altitude.I\u2019m using a FlySky FS-T6 2.4ghz transmitter with FlySky R6-B receiver.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FL9/5NAR/J70QMLDE/FL95NARJ70QMLDE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHG/71DP/J70QMLCQ/FHG71DPJ70QMLCQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F99/WVUW/J70QMLDV/F99WVUWJ70QMLDV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Choosing Electronics and Parts"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "The electronics that you buy does not come with connectors.

So, we\u2019ll start by soldering female bullet connectors on the ESC.How to solder female bullet connectors on ESC?Hold the bullet connector using helping hands.Apply heat to the bullet connector by touching soldering iron to surface of the connector and fill 1/2 of the shallow end with solder.Keep applying the heat and dip the stripped end of the wire into it.Remove the soldering iron. Do not apply heat for a long time or this could damage your ESC.Why solder female bullet connectors on the ESC?Suppose you solder male bullet connectors on your ESC and you connect your ESC to the battery without motors connected to its other end. The male connectors of the ESC are likely to come in contact with each other resulting in short circuiting. And you might end up burning your ESC. So generally, we connect female connectors on electronics that are giving power. While electronics that are receiving power takes male connectors.Once done with the soldering, apply heat shrink to the bullet connectors. Now, we do not want ESC\u2019s wire to short circuiting by touching each other. So cover it perfectly using heat shrink. Such that end of heat shrink lines with the end of bullet connectors.

In order to know about throttle channel and polarity of your receiver refer to user\u2019s manual of the Transmitter and Receiver.Connect the servos to the receiver. One of the servos goes to rudder channel and the other goes to elevator channel. Again, it doesn\u2019t matters which one of the servos goes to rudder or elevator. While connecting, make sure the polarity of servo lead is right.Here\u2019s the setup that I am using:Servos are connected to channel 1 and channel 2.  ESC\u2019s servo lead goes to channel 3 of the receiver.Now before connecting battery, always remember this as a rule:Unless you are ready to fly, never put on your propellers to the motor. I repeat NEVER!!!Putting on propellers to the motor and running it can be extremely dangerous.

Move the sticks and watch your airplane\u2019s response.For right stick,Pull the stick down: Elevator should go up.Push the stick up: Elevator should come down.Move the stick to right: Rudder should move right.Move the stick to left: Rudder should move left.For left stick,Push the stick up: Motor starts rotatingPull the stick down: Motor slows down and finally stops.If any one of these doesn\u2019t respond correctly go to functions setup on your transmitter and opt for reversing.

Simply switch the servo lead going to the receiver.If you power on your motor and it\u2019s running the opposite way switch any two of its wire going to the ESC, this will reverse the direction of rotation of the motor.Throws:Throws decide how much your control surfaces are going to move. If you have your throws set to 100%; your airplane is going to react a lot even for very small movement on the sticks of your transmitter. So, make sure to set your throws to about 30-35% while programming the radio. A lot of movement of the control surfaces is just not good, especially for beginners.Balancing the Airplane:Now all you need is to place the battery on the airplane using a velcro or double sided tape. Generally, the battery is the heaviest part on an RC airplane. So, we use the battery for balancing the airplane. Now for balancing we make sure that the entire weight of the airplane is concentrated near the Center of gravity of the airplane. This is a very crucial step and cannot be ignored.I've added a reference line for Center of gravity (or CG) in the plans. Anyways, the Center of gravity for this airplane is about 11 cm behind the motor mount. So, move your li-po battery back and forward unless the weight of the airplane is roughly concentrated near CG. Here's a nice article on  how to balance your airplane by FliteTest. Once you have balanced your airplane it's time to fly.Here's a quick first flight check list:Make sure that your airplane's control surfaces are responding correctly.Everything is plugged in right.You have your airplane balanced.Your battery is charged.Here's a nice article by FlightTest for first successful flight.Li-po battery charging and safety:Li-po batteries can prove dangerous if not used and handled with care. Always charge a lipo battery using a balance charger. Balance charger is important for a long life of lipo batteries. Balance charger makes sure that your lipo is not over charged and each cell of the lipo is at the same voltage.Never over discharge your lipo batteries. Over discharging lipo batteries can damage your batteries. Use lipo battery voltage alarm that will beep when your battery is discharged. Here's a nice  lipo safety guide by The Drone Girl.For 3s lipo battery:Fully charged voltage: 12.6 VFully discharged voltage: 9.0 VTroubleshooting: If you follow each step with precision you should not encounter any problems. Anyways If you still face problems and you are unable to get your airplane into air write in the comments below or refer to a good RC forum around the internet.

But in short, my children and I have amassed a large amount of Trading Cards by now. The handling, sorting, etc. is very difficult with these quantities. We have already tried it, but we gave up frustrated. For this reason I want to build a Trading Card Machine, which should take on different tasks. Trading Cards should automatically be managed (Which cards do I have?, Which ones are missing?)         sorted (Block, Language, Set, Series, etc)         rated (How valuable are my cards?, How much money do I have to spend for a full set?)         traded (Buy and Sell)Because of this ambitious goals, I decided to split the huge machine into 3 parts. Card Feeder - a machine which grab and transport a single card out of a card stackCard Scanner - a part where the cards will be analyzed         Card Sorter - a machine which will store the identified cardsThis Instructable is about the 3rd part, the Card Sorter. Cards that have passed through the machine will be stored in the Card Sorter. The decision on what is sorted is made by the Card Scanner. The Card Sorter is only responsible for the right place to store the cards.The focus of the Trading Card Machine is currently on the World of Warcraft Trading Cards, as we have by far the most cards from this type. That's why I designed the Card Sorter so that every set has its own storage compartment. There were 21 sets in the WoW universe, so I need space for 21 + 1 storage opportunities. The additional tray is for cards that were not recognized by the Card Scanner or that could not be assigned to the Card Sorter.There are many ways to do it.It was important to me: as few mechanical and electrical parts as possible          to use gravity         cool look         a lot of movement         visible movementIt was NOT important to me:space saving, lightweight, portable         effective or fastAfter many considerations and a few sleepless nights, I had decided on the following variant:The Card Feeder is in the middle at the highest position and put the cards on a ramp. These then slide down into the Card Scanner. After the Scanner, the cards slide down over a ramp into one of the 22 compartments. These 22 storage areas are arranged in a circle around the center and can be positioned by a motor to the ramp accordingly.Exactly this part I want to show you.Let's do it!In this instructable I will show you Part 3 - How to create the Card Sorter.", "title": "Card Sorter for a Trading Card Machine (Update 2019-01-10)", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Card-Sorter-for-a-Trading-Card-Machine/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Tools and MaterialsHere's what I used to create the Card Sorter:Tools: Cutting matRulers               Cutter               Compass with pencil and bladeSolvent-containing adhesives (UHU HART and tesa)               Tape               Drill + 5mm wood drill bit               Hot glue gun + glue gun sticks               RouterMilling compass               8mm spiral cutter bit, 12mm core box cutter bitSanding paper               Rubber bands                Screwdrivers                    Pencil, markers               Scraper or something similar with rounded corners               Center punch               Drill Station (not on the picture)3D Printer (not on the picture)Materials:3mm cardboard (I used it for the Boxes and the Timing Belt)                   9mm birch plywood (main material for the Card Sorter)                   12mm steel balls                  DIN A3 paper                PLA filament (not on the picture)               Wood glue               Adafruit Stepper MotorArduino UNOAdafruit Motor Shield power supplyAdafruit Motor Shield V2Adafruit Motor Shield V2 LibrarySome kind of computer, equipment, cables, etc. to connect and program the Arduino UNO (not on the picture)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FOE/B8CL/JPSNYHEC/FOEB8CLJPSNYHEC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0R/NC7C/JPSNYHE9/F0RNC7CJPSNYHE9.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Tools and Materials"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Prototype As mentioned in the Intro, 22 Boxes should orbit around the Card Feeder which is placed in the center, but how to do that? After some researches I found what I was looking for. The Thrust Ball Bearing was the key to success. Since this was the challenge in this project, I created a Prototype of it.I made the 1st version out of cardboard and put them together using craft glue and hot glue. It consisted of a base area, two different large outer rings and one smaller circle in the center. The distances between the outer rings and the inner circle were chosen so that 12mm steel balls can run along the groove. 12mm, why 12mm balls? For one thing, I had a lot of it in stock, on the other 12mm are a common size for tools. There are 12mm drills, 12mm cutter bits, etc. In principle, it worked well. Unfortunately, good is not good enough. Cardboard is simply too soft and creates a lot of friction, making the Thrust Bearing hard to move. Everything is possible, but the effort was too high for me in this case.That's why I switched to MDF in the 2nd Prototype. With my router I first milled the outer radius and then a 30mm wide groove into the piece of wood. The groove is for a ball cage. Afterwards I used a 12mm core box cutter bit to mill the groove for the steel balls. Last but not least, I cut out the inside radius. I have repeated the whole process twice and thus received a top and bottom for the Thrust Bearing.I created a ball cage out of 3mm MDF. I used a compass to distribute 6x 12mm holes evenly on the cage. Then I drilled them on the drill press.To reduce friction, I have sealed and sanded the contact surfaces.Then it was time for some tests.Test 1 => 6 steel balls with the ball cageTest 2 => 6 steel balls without the ball cageI was very satisfied with both variants. Test 1 was more consistent due to the even distribution of the balls through the cage. Test 2 was smoother without the additional friction of the ball cage.I also thought about a mechanism to hold the Thrust Bearing together, but then I did not pursue it. Maybe a topic for the future.In order to get a feel for the sizes, I  transferred the space that the 22 Boxes need to a piece of 3mm cardboard. With a compass and a cutting blade I cut out the shape (450mm outer radius and 300mm inner radius). The measurements fitted very well and left enough room for any changes.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FP4/H5PK/JPSO2Z0N/FP4H5PKJPSO2Z0N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQQ/KUGG/JPSO2UQJ/FQQKUGGJPSO2UQJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXE/JX6N/JPSO2UR1/FXEJX6NJPSO2UR1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL8/LG0M/JPSO2US3/FL8LG0MJPSO2US3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Prototype"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Design(You can find the drawing as a pdf in the attachment!)I transferred the ideas and insights from the Prototype to Fusion360 and created a more accurate model there.

I have extruded this 2D sketch to 9mm (thickness of the wood that I will use).In the next step I created a groove for the 12mm steel balls. The groove is only 2mm deep.To get the top of the Thrust Bearing, I copied the whole object and flipped it horizontally.Between bottom and top, I've created 6x 12mm balls and evenly distributed them into the groove.With the help of a 2nd sketch I created a Timing Belt on the inside surface of the upper side. In previous projects I already had good experiences with timing belts. That is the main reason to use it in this project again. The Timing Belt is mounted directly on the Thrust Bearing and can be driven by a Drive Wheel attached to a Motor.On top of the upper side are the 22 Boxes for the cards.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FBD/OWK3/JPX5ACDB/FBDOWK3JPX5ACDB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCW/JYYM/JPX5ACD5/FCWJYYMJPX5ACD5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF1/2C2C/JPX5ACDH/FF12C2CJPX5ACDH.ANIMATED.LARGE.gif"], "step_title": "Step 3: Design"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Boxes(You can find the box template as a pdf in the attachment!)The Boxes are used to store the cards. Temporarily I made them out of cardboard. The size of a box is determined by the card itself. Most cards have a size of 63 x 88mm. So that the cards have enough space, I added 3mm to each side. Inside 69 x 94mm.                 Outside 75 x 100mm (I used a 3mm cardboard)                Height 50mm (That's enough for about 100 cards)For the shape of the box I used an online generator. I printed the box pattern on A3. After rough cutting the template with the cutter, I glued it to a piece of 3mm cardboard with tesa liquid glue. This time I did not take care on the backside. Normally it is important and necessary to apply glue and paper on both sides, as otherwise the cardboard will bend during the drying phase.Then I cut out the shape with a cutter and a ruler on my cutting mat. I worked my way through the material in several steps. Not the whole at once!Since I did not want to fold the sides of the box, as it was actually specified in the template, I cut off all folding surfaces. With a blunt object, in my case a spatula with rounded corners, I have traced all the folding edges in several passes. That made it easier to fold. Then I folded it to a box and temporary fixed all sides with a tape. Finally I glued everything together with a hot glue gun.

The bottom of the bearing will be fixed and only the top is movable. Basis were two 1000 x 1000 x 9mm birch plywood plates.I started with the bottom of the Thrust Bearing. As a guide, I have drawn all measurements with a compass to the wood.Outer radius 450mm               Groove for the ball, radius 375mm               Inner radius 300mmI created the pivot point for the milling compass with a drill and a 5mm wood drill bit. Then I started with the outer radius (450mm), for this I have used a router, a milling compass and an 8mm spiral cutter bit. In order not to damage the table, I put the plywood a bit higher on some leftover wood. In 3mm steps, I worked through the wooden plate.Afterwards I switched to a 12mm core box cutter bit and milled a groove for the 12mm steel balls with a radius of 375mm and a depth of 2mm. Then I changed back to the 8mm spiral cutter bit and cut out the inner radius of 300mm.After a short test that the steel balls were running smoothly, I have created the top of the Thrust Bearing on the same principle and with the same materials.Finally, I sanded the surfaces, corners and grooves of the bearing.I evenly distributed 12mm steel balls in the groove on the bottom and then I  put the top on. It took a certain amount of power to set the bearing in motion. But after that it works surprisingly well.For the moment I did not use a ball cage, because I did not have a really good idea how to implement it. A variant as in the Prototype would have been possible, but this would have to be specially built so that the cage rests only on the balls and not on the bottom and top.

The power from the Motor is transmitted to a Timing Belt via a Drive Wheel. The belt is firmly connected to the bearing which leads to a rotational movement. To implement this, I created a Timing Belt made out of cardboard.I cut out 3x 9mm wide strips from a piece of  3mm thick cardboard. I used again a cutter, a ruler and a cutting mat. Then I made cuts in the top layers of the cardboard. I repeated this process for all 3 cardboard strips. What was left after peeling of all the little top layer pieces was my Cardboard Timing Belt.To reach the right length, I glued all three strips together using some tesa liquid glue. Then I glued the Timing Belt with some hot glue to the inner radius of the Thrust Bearing upper side. The bearing and the belt are both 9mm wide, so the adjustment was very easy. I used a center punch to press the belt (each tooth) to the bearing. It is important, that there is no gap between Timing Belt and Thrust Bearing. Otherwise, it will cause uneven rotation. Excess hot glue can easily be wiped off the surface.The result looked really nice and worked even well. However, it is still cardboard. The teeth are not the strongest. For that reason I decided to do a little stabilization. In contrast to the Card Feeder I used only wood glue to fill the holes in the Timing Belt. In retrospect, don't do that. :) It was so intense and timing consuming. I had to fill every tooth with glue 8 times. If you want to stabilize cardboard, please look at this step in the Card Feeder.Nevertheless, the teeth are hardened and very solid.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ5/F14K/JPX4UX7I/FZ5F14KJPX4UX7I.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4P/H912/JPX4UX7J/F4PH912JPX4UX7J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FK3/D4HX/JPX4UX7K/FK3D4HXJPX4UX7K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKM/2BUU/JPX4UXBF/FKM2BUUJPX4UXBF.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Cardboard Timing Belt"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "3D Printed Drive Wheel(You can find the wheel as a stl in the attachment!)The top of the Thrust Bearing will be driven by a stepper motor. For that I need a Drive Wheel which fits on the motor shaft and also to the Cardboard Timing Belt. Because of this special requirement I designed and printed the Drive Wheel. I created a wheel for my motor, which has a 5mm shaft, in Fusion360.  The decisive reason for the diameter of the wheel is the position of the teeth on the Timing Belt. It is important to work only with full teeth. Otherwise, the wheel would not fit perfectly into the timing belt. This will cause to an uneven rotation and lost steps inside the motor. In my case this means that the Drive Wheel has to be 63mm in diameter.With that said, I created 2D Sketch with a 63mm circle and extruded it to 9mm (thickness of the bearing and the belt). I also added an attachment to mount the wheel to the motor shaft. This attachment is a kind of pocket in which a M3 hexnut will fit. A M3 screw can be screwed in perpendicular to the shaft. With that little system it can be mounted to the motor.I exported the object as STL-file and imported it into the Cura WANHAO Edition. After I made some basic adjustments (Rotation, Infill %), I create the g-code and sent it to my 3D Printer.After the process was finished, I clamped the Drive Wheel into my Drill Station. With medium speed and some sanding paper I roughen the surface to enhance the gluing properties. In the next step I put some glue (UHU HART) on a piece of Cardboard Timing Belt and glued it onto the Drive Wheel. I used some rubber bands to hold everything in place.I used the same method to stabilize the Timing Belt on the drive wheel as I did it on the Thrust Bearing and filled all holes in the belt with wood glue.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FBJ/4MNT/JPX5APUP/FBJ4MNTJPX5APUP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F89/MYUX/JPX5AEZL/F89MYUXJPX5AEZL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRX/FHAY/JPX5AF2N/FRXFHAYJPX5AF2N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM4/BS5H/JPX5AEUJ/FM4BS5HJPX5AEUJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLK/LPLX/JPX5AERP/FLKLPLXJPX5AERP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: 3D Printed Drive Wheel"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Electrical PartsAs already mentioned, the top of the Thrust Bearing is driven by a motor. For my point of view the best motor for this task is a stepper motor.I used the following motor, because I already had them. But I realized quickly that it was not the best motor for the job. It was to weak regarding speed and torque. But for the first test the motor is ok.No, totally wrong. I realized nothing. I made a stupid mistake. It helps if you can read. :) I use a 12V/350mA Motor via USB??? No way. Of course the motor has no power.   I bought a 12V/3A power supply and connected it to the Adafruit Motor Shield.

This shield is stacked on an Arduino Uno. The Arduino was powered by USB from a computer. The motor should supplied by a DC power supply, but for my short tests I used the USB power supply. No, wrong decision.One important part is the homing of the Card Sorter. There will be no position sensors for the Boxes. Everything will be realized with steps. So it is essential that on anytime the Card Sorter knows which step position he has and which step position the Boxes have. At the moment I did the homing with a simple switch on a breadboard connected to an input pin on the Arduino. In the end I have to create a mechanism on or inside the bearing. I think IR break beam sensors will be the best solution.

So the stepper motor should deliver us the right box to the right time at position 9 o'clock to store a card. To do so the stepper motor can rotate the top of the Thrust Bearing clockwise and counterclockwise.box number 10 is now on position 9 o'clock. To bring the box to this position the stepper has to go 800 Steps. Now we switch of the Card Sorter completely. On the next restart we would have a problem because the system don't know the actual status. Is it right? Is it wrong? In our case it would be wrong, because the 800 steps from our last run are now the new 0. Everything is shifted. At the beginning of a routine, box 1 should be always on position 9 o'clock with 0 Steps.Long story short, The stepper motor rotates the right box to the Card Feeder after every restart a homing is necessary. The Card Sorter has 22 Boxes on top which are evenly distributed. That means 360\u00b0/22 ~ every 16\u00b0 is a box. The stepper motor has a 1.8\u00b0 step angle (200 steps/revolution). I have done a quick test to identify the right steps to reach the 16\u00b0. I created two cardboard templates with all angles and positions and also marked a position on the Drive Wheel. Then the stepper motor turned one turn (200 steps). I marked this position on the template and measured it with a protractor. 200 steps => 40\u00b0, which means to reach the 16\u00b0, 80 steps are required. The numbers are rounded, so maybe there will be some adjustment in the final Trading Card Machine. In the video I'm using INTERLEAVE. So I have to double the steps.Now let's have a look at the code.It's based on the Adafruit AccelStepper example. I deleted the two not needed motors and add some own functions.

If the 0-position switch is found during this time, the motor stops and the step position is set to 0. If the switch is NOT found during this rotation, it will create an error message.Serial Interface:In the final Trading Card Machine the Card Scanner will send the required position to the Card Sorter. At the moment I use the Serial Monitor to talk with the Sorter. I can see some messages what the code is doing and I can send some positions (steps) to the motor.

We can see that a switch function is used to change the current state based on the conditions that we set.  Each state breaks when a defined condition is met. Comments before each state describe the conditions that need to be met to enter the desired state. For example, to enter the retract state the, the rocker switch must be in retract mode and the save flag must not be activated.  However, to enter the extend state, the rocker switch must be in extend mode, the save flag AND the extend limit flag are deactivated. State 4, the limit save state, is entered when the save flag is active, regardless of any other external conditions.Within each state we write a defined integer constant of BACKWARDS, FORWARDS, or MTR_STOP  to the output write function. These values are integers that are the required RC servo values to perform a full speed extend/retract, or to shut power off to the actuators motor.  The code responsible for writing outputs is the following:// Output Write Function //\nvoid writeOutput() {\n  myservo.writeMicroseconds(mtrState); //Write the motor speed\n  digitalWrite(LED, ledState); //Write to LED (on or off)\n}The myservo.write() command is responsible for the writing the integer constant.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 6: State Machine and Motor Control"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "With the implementation of the potentiometer feedback function, we can obtain an accurate potentiometer reading when saving the extension limit.

If so, the global save flag is activated.Once the save routine flag is active, the state machine enters the limit save state.  If the user is not pressing the pushbutton, the save routine flag is reset. Within the limit save state, the current potentiometer value is stored into an extended limit global variable called extendLimit and the on-board LED is activated.

You will see that the process is quick and simple. Also, it is easy to customize for different classes, lesson plans, and modalities (each student gets to spin it and randomly stop on one of the entries written around the edge - then they can be asked to write, read aloud, solve, convert, discuss, etc. that entry).", "title": "An Educational Fidget Spinner - Finally!", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/An-Educational-Fidget-Spinner-Finally/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "These devilish little things in the first picture - skateboard bearings - are the center of nearly every Fidget Spinner. You can buy them inexpensively online and at many local retail outlets. Just Google \"skateboard bearings\" and voila! Lots of choices, many for less than $1 each when you buy a pack of 8.The general design is extremely simple:It is a circle with a skateboard bearing in the center. The circle is divided into pie slices. Each pie slice contains a reference entry for the lesson you plan to teach. The photos show the following design steps, in order...Make sure you know the size of the skateboard bearings you bought. They are standard sizes, but a ruler or other measuring device can help you double check. Mine are 0.865\" (inches) in diameter.Draw the circle you plan to use as your general design. This way you can see that it can comfortably fit in the hands of your students - they want to only touch the skateboard bearing with their index finger and thumb, and the rest of the Fidget Spinner should be able to spin freely (not rub against their palm, etc.). My students are adults so I choose a 4 inch diameter.Make a note of your measurements on a roughly 1:1 scale (and poorly drawn) hand sketch, so you can get a feel for the amount of letters you can fit in a pie slice.Remember - any lesson that has a table of anywhere between 4 to 20 short text entries that students must learn - can be easily made into a Fidget Spinner.As an example, I want to teach students how to convert a 4 digit Binary number into Decimal and/or Hexadecimal, and back again. Whether or not that last sentence makes sense to you - here is the table with 16 total entries that I want them to learn:0000 in Binary = 0 in Decimal = 0 in Hexadecimal0001 in Binary = 1 in Decimal = 1 in Hexadecimal...

That's because I wanted the center hole to be about .92 inches across - a little bit bigger than my 0.865 inch skateboard bearing.

Students design and create cam toy machines with moving objects/characters that symbolize abstract concepts and represent dynamic situations.The lesson is structured to follow the Engineering Design Process (EDP), a process widely used by designers in any discipline to tackle challenges. While there are many ways that people solve problems, designers often opt to use the EDP because it offers a roadmap for the project journey and will help them work efficiently and effectively. The process requires that the designer first clearly Define the challenge, then Learn about and Explore existing solutions, before beginning the design stage. This understanding of the problem, combined with the Design step requirement of generating at least 3 different ideas, allows for a rich set of creative solutions to draw from in choosing a design direction. The designer is now ready to prototype the solution in the Create step. An important feature of the EDP is the expectation that the designer will build 2 or more prototypes after the direction is set. This is done by cycling through the Create and Observe/Improve steps a few times. It is recommended that students have an opportunity for at least 2 design-build-improve cycles. When students feel they have to \u201cget it right the first time\u201d they are less willing to take risks and be creative. On the second and later times through the cycle, they can fix flaws and adopt successful ideas from classmates. Hopefully, the designer will have an opportunity to Reflect on the product they created and the process they followed, looking for learning habits and insights that will help in future challenges. The Share step involves documentation, publishing, or presenting to affirm the project and inspire others.Essential Question(s)How can creating metaphors be used to increase understanding and enhance communication skills?How can movement and imagery be used to create metaphors for social, scientific, and other academic concepts?Skills Practiced:Analysis and Abstract ModelingMechanical designEngineering Design3D modeling in TinkercadTime Required: 3-4 HoursMaterials Needed:Sketch paper3D printer and filamentCraft materials such as (cardstock, foam sheets, markers, hot glue)Flexible PVC tubing, \u00bc\u201d inside diameterWood dowels, \u00bc\u201d diameter (optional, to reduced 3D printing time)", "title": "Mechanical Cam Toys", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Mechanical-Cam-Toys/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "ContextCreating physical objects can be an engaging and useful way for students to process their learning. Some physical models are directly representative of the academic content, such as a depiction of a sound wave, or a model of a cell. Abstract concepts, like a balance of power, ecological interactions, or societal changes, are also well-suited to modeling. Students practice higher order thinking skills when creating metaphors and symbols for abstract concepts. Coming up with imagery for social, scientific, or other academic concepts pushes the student to research the topic and develop a deeper understanding of it. The addition of motion, as in the Cam Toy activity, can make the project even more engaging and lead to creative, entertaining products.Cams are rotating shapes that push on / rub against mechanical elements to create other motions. One rotating shaft can power many cams, and each can create a different motion in its associated mechanical element. Students decide which of these motions is best for the specific concepts they want to represent. In this project, students design the cams and moving objects in Tinkercad for fabrication on a 3D printer or laser cutter. Backgrounds or other static objects can be designed in Tinkercad and fabricated in a variety of ways for a more elaborate Cam Toy machine.Challenge: Design and build a Cam Toy with motions and scenery that represent concepts related to the specified topic. Students may work in groups of 2 or 3. A Cam Toy base, rotating shaft, and a few cam designs are provided at this Tinkercad link. The base accommodates 2 motions. Students can modify the models to make smaller or larger machines.Criteria:Includes 2 characters/objects that move when the toy is operated. Possible motion types are:Up-downSpinSide-to-sideIncludes 1 static object that is a background, piece of scenery, or other objects. The motions and scenery must represent concepts related to the specified topic.Constraints:The 2 motions must be different. The same type of motion can be used twice if the 2 motions differ either in frequency or magnitude. (For example, if there are 2 up-down motions 1 can have 2 rises/falls per cycle while the other has 1. For spinning, 1 can spin at a faster speed than the other. The appearance and motions of the characters and objects must communicate the intended concept.Student Product / Learning GoalsStudents will choose motions that express physical or abstract concepts. They will design and build a working cam toy that expresses these concepts as a representative model or metaphor.", "step_imgs": ["/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png"], "step_title": "Step 1: Define"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "1.

Design: Students work together to brainstorm ideas on how to represent the topic they are assigned using the mechanical motions commonly done in automata. Use the inspiration page as a reference and create a design that is simple enough to build while still being complex enough to communicate an idea. Backgrounds, scenery and other static objects can be very helpful in communicating the idea. The design process is most effective when designers create at least 3 different ideas.Option A: draw designs on how the Cam Toy will look and/or function. Use paper, whiteboard, drawing apps.Option B: Build simple models using crafting materials (paper, glue, clay, pipe cleaners, etc.) to show look and/or functionOption C: Let the students play around in Tinkercad to get familiar with the program and make practice models.Example project for Social Studies: Systems and Interactions and in the United States Government. One concept to explore is the differences between the 2 parts of Congress, House of Representatives and the Senate. The House has 435 members as opposed to 100 in the Senate The length of term in the House is 2 years, while the Senate term is 6 years. The Senate has the power to confirm judges, Cabinet members etc, while the House does not.This design shows the differences in term lengths and includes a non-traditional cam shape - a triangle. In one rotation of the camshaft, the triangle cam will move the House up-down three times while the eccentric circular cam will move the Senate up-down once. The student may express that one rotation of the camshaft represents 6 years.Example projects for Earth Science:Hurricanes. One factor in the creation of a hurricane is warm air rising off the ocean. This is shown with up/down motion. The spinning storm is shown with rotary motion.Sea breezes on the beach. They are caused by heat rising from warm beach sand and can be shown with up/down motion. The breeze comes in from the ocean to fill the void from the rising air; it is shown with side-to-side motion or rotary motion.Land breeze at the beach during nighttime - a reverse of the previous example.2.

Each of these parameters has \u201cgains\u201d normally called Kp, Ki, and Kd.PID provides correction between the desired value (or input) and the actual value (or output). The difference between the input and the output is called \u201cerror\u201d. The PID controller reduces the error to the smallest value possible by continually adjusting the output. In our Arduino self-balancing robot, the input (which is the desired tilt, in degrees) is set by software. The MPU6050 reads the current tilt of the robot and feeds it to the PID algorithm which performs calculations to control the motor and keep the robot in the upright position.PID requires that the gains Kp, Ki, and Kd values be \u201ctuned\u201d to optimal values. We will adjust the PID values manually instead.Make Kp, Ki, and Kd equal to zero.Adjust Kp. Too little Kp will make the robot fall over (not enough correction). Too much Kp will make the robot go back and forth wildly. A good enough Kp will make the robot slightly go back and forth (or oscillate a little).Once the Kp is set, adjust Kd. A good Kd value will lessen the oscillations until the robot is almost steady.  Also, the right amount of Kd will keep the robot standing even if pushed.Lastly, set the Ki. The robot will oscillate when turned on even if the Kp and Kd are set but will stabilize in time. The correct Ki value will shorten the time it takes for the robot to stabilize.Suggestion for better results!I recommend that you create a similar robot frame using the materials used in this project to make the source code for the Balance Robot work stably and efficiently.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FOU/ZDH0/J9SVYFT5/FOUZDH0J9SVYFT5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUK/IP39/J9SVYFT8/FUKIP39J9SVYFT8.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Source Code and Libraries"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "You can subscribe to the my YouTube channel for more tutorials and projects.

Solution: Remove flywheel and replace with normal V-belt pulley.  *If the flywheel you take off had fins for cooling the motor, replace it with either a blade mounted to the shaft or an externally powered fan* Taking the flywheel off can be a pain. The flywheel are left-hand 4m thread and can really be cinched down or corroded onto the shaft. Chuck the flywheel end in a vise and turn the shaft on the opposing end Clock-wise and the flywheel may come off. Some Motors don't have 2 shafts. The shaft on the brush side is usually hidden under the bearing housing. For the stubborn or single shaft motors I use a hacksaw and run the motor on low speed and use it like a metal lathe and saw the pulley through once or twice. It always comes off easily when you turn the nut into 3 thinner nuts rather than one wide nut. Just make sure you don't cut into the motor shaft. Eyeball it close and then test it by turning it with a pair of vise grips until you are through the threaded portion.Or....

If you come up with better solutions PLEASE let me know so I can update them.problem 1)  Treadmill motors have a 3-4 pound fywheel. Engineers calculate the energy stored by spinning this heavy flywheel to obtain Horsepower ratings referred to as \"Treadmill Duty Horsepower\". Any quick changes in speed aren't noticed because of the kinetic energy still stored in the flywheel. Sometimes you can hear the motor totally turn off till the flywheel spools down and balances the motors RPM with the respective setting on the rheostat. If the load is restored or the speed setting raised above the motor's present speed, the motor turns right back on. Solution: remove the flywheel. Some of that kinetic energy will be stored in the piece of equipment you are powering but if not then some horsepower could be lost. problem 2) When starting up a treadmill you wouldn't want it to start up at full speed while you are on it.

EXPLAINING OF THE VISUAL DESIGN AND PROGRAMMING LOGIC Our application rely on 4 basis. These are;I. Provide direction control of the car.II. Transfer live video streaming from car to user.III. Connection signal level indicator of vehicle.IV. Follow Me (Vey Soon). (Following the car its owner.) To that 4 basis;Main details using direction control of the car was told in Arduino section. If we explain to the Android side, there will be available Seek bar (Velocity setting), Camera On / Off,Wi-Fi status indicator and Arrow keys.Seek bar(Velocity setting) is created from 15 slice and velocity coefficient is 17. So any move of the Seek bar, there will be changing 17 and its multiples. For instance, If Seek bar in fifth order, produced pwm = 5*17 = 85.Menu keys (Camera On/Off and WiFi Indicator) Other vehicle control functions beside Seekbar '\u0131n;Camera on / off button for taking the camera image through the vehicle \"  Open \", \"  CLOSE \", In the same way, an indication of whether our application is connected to the Wi-Fi network we created on Raspberry Pi.\" NOT CONNECTED \", \" CONNECTED \" Arrow keys provide seperating directions of data which take from Seek bar(Velocity setting). For moving direction of the car, + or - sign come to head of the PWM value.For example: 200:200 // move forward. (2 motors work with 200pwm)200:-200 //move backward. (2 motors work with 200pwm)200:-200 // left motor turns 200 pwm to forward, right motor turns 200 pwm to backward (The car turns its around from left to right.)200:-200 // left motor turns 200 pwm to backward, right motor turns 200 pwm to forward (The car turns its around from right to left.)200:100 // The car moves as turning to the right. 2.SENSITIVITY IN TURNING LEFT AND RIGHT When our car moving to right cross and left cross, motors' PWM value which will be turning side decreases, and so this provides slower motor rotating. So, the car can achieve the intended turnings. This rotating sensitivity setting let to user.The formula for calculating cross turnings: PWM VALUE - ((PWM VALUE) / PWM RATE)  In default, PWM RATE is 2.  You can reach the PWM RATE setting from right-top button in the screen and from there to Settings menu.  PWM interval which can be entered is a value as a minimum and maximimum between 1-4 interval in integer and double type.FOR ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION, CLICK HERE", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F3U/87ZF/IWQUUR58/F3U87ZFIWQUUR58.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1O/51AK/IWQUUR59/F1O51AKIWQUUR59.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F43/ZE3M/IWQUURET/F43ZE3MIWQUURET.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: ANDROID:"}], "channel": "Arduino"}, {"category": "technology", "description": "a.articles {\n\tcolor: white;\n\tbackground: red;\n\tfont-weight: bold;\n\tfont-style: italic;\n\ttext-decoration: none;\n}\na.articles:hover {\n\tbackground: black;\n}\nThis instructable describes an A2 plotter made from low cost aluminium extrusion, a piece of particle board, two NEMA17 stepper motors, and a few belts and pulleys.The plotter is:high resolution (80 steps/mm),            fast,            low-cost,            and scaleableThe plotter has an on-board interpreter that recognizes the g-code output from \"Inkscape\" .Metal work is simple ... all you need is a hacksaw, three drills, a rat-tail file, and a screwdriver.12 October 2017:An improved pen-lift is described in instructable https://www.instructables.com/id/CNC-Pen-Lift/16 November 2017:Bluetooth is added in instructable https://www.instructables.com/id/Add-Bluetooth-to-...Z-axis control is added in instuctable https://www.instructables.com/id/CNC-Pen-and-Wash-...17 March 2018:GRBL (optional) installed in instructable https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Control-a-...", "title": "CoreXY CNC Plotter", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/CoreXY-CNC-Plotter/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The wiring diagram for this plotter is shown in photo 1.The EasyDriver module expects the wires from each motor coil to be adjacent.

This arrangement has the advantage that all unbalanced timing-belt tension is in the direction of pen movement as shown by the arrows in photo 2 and photo 3.         Pen wobble was eliminated by using an extra guide rail for the pen assembly.                          Variations in belt tension were eliminated by replacing the spring with cable-ties.The design is scalable:Photo 4 compares the original A4 plotter with the base of a larger A2 plotter described in step 7.The gantry and pen carriage dimensions are common to all plotters.

First we will go over the basic scientific forces that affect the quad-copter's ability to fly, maneuver, and hover. These are all essential to the design process.  These forces include thrust, lift, drag, and weight.Thrust & WeightThrust is the mechanical force that drives our quads upward. Thrust is generated by the motors. Variables that affect thrust include propeller size, motor strength, and weight of the quad itself. Bigger propellers produce more thrust per revolution, however, they also add more weight.  Stronger motors produce more thrust by spinning faster but may also require more juice (power).  These are just a few examples of trade-offs that you should consider when designing your own quad.  Weight is pretty self explanatory.  This is simply the downward force due to gravity and mass. This follows the simple physics equation of F = ma. Where \"F\" is the total force created (in this case, weight), \"m\" = the total mass of the object, and \"a\" is the acceleration of gravity which is -9.8m/s^2.  \"a\" is negative because it is a downward force, and in our case, the desired direction is upward.Weight and Thrust counteract each other. In order to calculate how well our quads will fly, we must understand the Thrust to Weight Ratio (F/W, F = force of thrust)F/W = Thrust/Weight = (mass*acceleration)/(mass*gravity)If F/W\u2026= 1  - there is a chance the quad can fly  > 1   - the quad can accelerate vertically   > 2  - the quad will be quick and agileLiftLift is the ability to raise a given weight off of the ground.  Lift is created by each individual propeller blade. Variables that affect this are propeller size, weight, and RPM (Revolutions Per Minute). Bigger propellers produce more lift than smaller propellers. RPM is a measurement of how fast the propellers rotate.  Higher RPM\u2019s are required with smaller propellers to provide the same lift as bigger propellers with lower RPM. Here is another trade off to consider when designing your quad.DragDrag is a reaction force created by the propellers, and design of the quad-copter. ", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: Understanding the Science"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Radio frequency is what allows us to communicate wirelessly with our quad-copters.  Other examples are RC Cars and Video game controllers.  Radio Frequencies cover a portion of the electromagnetic radiation spectrum such as Infrared (IR) and \u201cradio waves\u201d.  These frequencies are measured in Hertz (HZ). For example, Wi-Fi uses radio frequencies that allow us to connect and communicate on the internet, these frequencies are typically 2.4 GHZ (gigahertz).For a list of examples and and more detailed description of Radio Frequency, visit these sites\u2026Detailed Description -  http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition...Examples -  http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/radio-spectr...", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 2: Radio Frequency. What Is It?"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "The remote control is how we communicate with wireless devices such as the quad-copter.  This communication is possible because of radio frequency.  Remote controls typically have multiple possible inputs that enable us to create movements and responses in our electronics.  For quad-copters, the remote control\u2019s basic uses include controlling the pitch, roll, yaw, and throttle. Pitch (Y-Axis Rotation) and Roll (X-Axis Rotation)Pitch and Roll control the side to side and front to back movements of the copter.  Roll is pretty simple to remember, it\u2019s like a rolling pencil (side to side), motors on one side rotate faster than those on the other side to cause a slight sideways tilt which moves the copter left or right.  Pitch is changed by different speeds between the front motors and the back, causing the copter to move forwards or backwards. The combination of pitch and roll gets tricky but allows the quad-copters to move diagonally.Yaw (Z-Axis Rotation)Yaw is a little bit more complicated than pitch and roll. First, it is important to understand that the rotors (propellers) directly opposite from each other must be spinning the same direction, counter-clockwise (CCW) or clockwise (CW). The rotors that are next to each other must NOT be spinning in the same direction. For example, is we go around the quad-copter clockwise the rotations should be\u2026 CW --> CCW --> CW --> CCW. If the rotations do no alternate, your quad-copter will not fly and will most likely spin out of control. Yaw uses these alternating rotations to help spin the quad-copter. By speeding up (applying more thrust) on a pair of rotors spinning in the same direction, it will cause the quad-copter to spin. The faster spinning rotors creates more torque (the force that causes an object to spin) than the ones spinning slower, causing to quad-copter to spin. Throttle Throttle should be another pretty self explanatory term. Throttle is how we control how much thrust we want from the motors. Controlling the throttle allows us the raise the quad up and down.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 3: Remote Control"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Here is the basic outline of the design process. Before you do any research or look at quad copters online, try to come up with some ideas and sketches.  This will help you boost your creativity and may give you some extra ideas to incorporate into your final design. At the end of this instructable I will include pictures of my design process.IdeationBe sure to keep in mind the scientific forces and the trade offs I mentioned before during your brainstorming and ideation.  Try creating different sketches with their own unique strengths. This will allow you to take the best features of several of your ideas and combine them into one.I created four sketches shown below and used some aspects of a couple to combine them into one.  After creating my sketches I did some research. Before I started my project I did not have much background experience with quad-copters so I needed a bit more info to help me move along with the design process.  After doing some research and looking at other examples of quads, I rated each of my sketches based on how I thought they would preform regarding the four basic scientific forces lift, drag, weight, and thrust. This is called a design matrix.  Be sure not to skip this step, it is a very important part of the engineering design process and will help you identify the strengths and weaknesses of your ideas.ConceptualizeAfter deciding a final design (or possibly two) sketch a more detailed model. This is called a conceptual model.  Be sure to include basic dimensions and small notes around your model explaining why you included features and how they would affect your design.  Note: Dimensions are very important. Most importantly, we need to take into consideration the dimensions of motors. Circumference, and Height.  These dimensions are critical because we need to model \"seats\" for the motor with proper tolerances in order for the motors to fit.  Next is the mathematical model. A mathematical model does not have to be a detailed sketch like your conceptual model.  It should focus on the math behind the (expected) performance of your final design.  Typically, a mathematical model can be in the form of a free body diagram. Free body diagrams helps you map out what forces are involved and how each force affects your flight. Be sure to consider the Force to Weight ration from above.  A mathematical model helps you come closer finalizing a design without building it.  This model will help you recognize the strengths and weaknesses that you might have overlooked with your conceptual model.Things to consider in your mathematical modelThrust   Lift   Drag   Weight   Total Mass    Battery Usage   Motor Strength   Propeller SizeCalculating Estimated ThrustHere are the specs for the Hubsan X4 H107L Motor (x4): Coreless MotorFrequency: 2.4GHz with 4 channelsBattery: 3.7V/240mAhFlight time: about 9 minutesMotor Weight \u2013 3.4g , Propeller weight \u2013 .3g,  Chip Weight \u2013 2.1gVisit this site to help you with your static thrust estimation: https://quadcopterproject.wordpress.com/static-thr...The Fun(nest) Part: 3D Modeling and the PrototypeNow hopefully your interest in this instructable is accompanied by your ability to use 3D modeling software such as Solidworks or Inventor. Explaining 3D modeling software and how to use it is another lesson in itself. If you do have experience that's great! Now we can move on to making our 3D quad-copter.  Based on your conceptual and mathematical models this part should be easier to do.  Create your model and play around with some of the modeling features. In this step, we can make a few tweaks and leisure of simply hitting the \"undo\" button (probably the greatest gift from the software gods). See what features or tools can help you optimize your design, for example I used a fillet tool to hep me round some edges.  Rounding the edges seemed like a good idea to me in regards of safety, aesthetics, and decreasing weight.  The best part about 3D modeling software is the ability to see the mass of your design before you print. In a way, this software is the extra step in the mathematical model stage. I am pretty experienced with 3D modeling software but I could still use a few more lessons on the more complicated features.  Solidworks and other software give us the ability to also test our materials, by applying outside forces to them.  This Finite Element Analysis (FEA) gives designers a huge advantage when it comes to the design process.  Since I do not have enough experience with the FEA section of Solidworks (the software I use) I cannot give much advice on how to properly test the quad in the 3D environment. If you find a way, or already have knowledge on how to properly simulate the affect of gravity, drag, and other forces, feel free to let me know!Okay, so now we have our 3D model and are ready to print.  Print your model and examine it. Did it print properly? Are there flaws in the design that affected the print? What can you do to improve the design based on your prototype? Is it durable enough? Do the motors fit? Can the wiring reach the designated spot for your microchip? These are all questions you should ask yourself after your first print because most likely there will be some issues.  After deciding what you want to improve, open your 3D file, make adjustments, and reprint.*As I said before, I will include pictures of my sketches, 3D model, prototype, and final product at the bottom.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FG4/W7XR/IMNQM35K/FG4W7XRIMNQM35K.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: The Design Process"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Here are my ideation sketches, conceptual model, first iteration (Red) and Final design/print (White).  For my conceptual model I tried to use some aspects from the four ideation sketches. As you can see, my first iteration (red) had some durability issues. The purpose of my first iteration was to test the general idea and design of my quad. I could tell immediately that the seats for the motors were too thin and would break easily. Seeing this allowed me to make some changes in Solidworks to improve the structure and durability. I also decided to cut down on weight by shortening distances and I also made small slots for the wiring (see close up picture of motor in seat). This small slot allowed for some wiggle room with the motor placement. Also, be sure to adjust the fill % of the print, to low will make your quad brittle and too high will add too much weight (Around 20% should be good).Soldering Tips:Blue/black - Negative ( - )Red/white - Positive ( + )Each motor has a set direction for this soldering configuration, either clockwise or counterclockwise. My quad was able to fly with all motors rotating outwards from the middle as opposed to inwards. In reference to the image with the motor directions my microchip would be facing northwest.

While you can get a metal pop-up assembly, the plastic one I used is cheaper and lighter.Supplies required:\u2022 1-1/4\" sink drain pop-up assembly for the hilt\u2022 1-1/2\" extension tube, 6\" length or 12\" length, for the hilt\u2022 1-1/2\" faucet hole cover for the hole in the extension tube\u2022 1-1/4\" polywasher or 1-1/4\" slip joint to create a tension connection between the pop-up assembly and extension tube\u2022 Packaging tape to increase tension fit as needed\u2022 1/2\" PVC pipe for the blade\u2022 Spray paint to color the blade\u2022 1\" vinyl tube (optional) to protect the paint on the blade\u2022 1-1/2\" rubber washers (optional), hilt decoration\u2022 Felt roll (optional), hilt decoration\u2022 Drawer liner (optional), hilt decoration\u2022 Craft foam (optional), hilt decoration\u2022 Split loom conduit (optional), hilt decoration\u2022 Worm gear (optional)Tools required:\u2022 Table saw for cutting PVC pipe, a hack saw would also work\u2022 Electric finishing sander or sandpaper to remove the lettering from the PVC pipe and vinyl tube\u2022 Utility or hobby knife (optional) for cutting the vinyl tube, felt, craft foam, split loom\u2022 Heat gun (optional) to reshape the vinyl tube\u2022 Scrap wood and nail to make a jig for painting the PVC blade\u2022 Pneumatic saw (optional) for cutting the extension tube. A dremel would also work.Safety concerns:\u2022 A table saw can remove fingers very quickly if you don't pay attention. Proceed with caution when using a hack saw, don't cut near or on your favorite antique.\u2022 Hobby and utility knives are very sharp. Always cut  away from your hands and body. Cut precisely, slow and steady, and use a cutting mat   so that you don't cut through anything you shouldn't. A straight edge  will help guide the cuts.\u2022 A heat gun gets very hot and can burn you. The plastic you heat up will get very hot. You will need to wear thick gloves when working with  hot plastic. You want to heat the plastic, but not melt it. \u2022 Spray paint must be used outdoors in a well ventilated area. A respirator or mask is recommended. Allow time to dry fully.  \u2022  Wear old clothes for painting. Chances are paint will find a way to  get  on your clothes. Be careful where you paint, and where you place  your  brushes.", "title": "Build a Lightsaber From the Plumbing Aisle", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Build-a-Lightsaber-from-the-Plumbing-Aisle/", "section": "play", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Take the pop-up assembly.

That is an inspirational read, but it wasn't quite what I wanted to accomplish. I wanted mine to be slightly larger in size, have electronic scoring, and to basically take ideas I've found across the web to make my skee ball machine one-of-a-kind and over-the-top. So, much like the previous skee ball instructable, I am not going to be able walk through each step with meticulous detail. It would be 100 pages long and nobody would ever build it.\u00a0 OK you're thinking, what is this instructable going to do for me? Let me tell you! I will give you everything you need to accomplish this project even if you've only done minor woodworking in the past. I am also going to tell you all of the materials used, which is a treasure hunt of it's own. We will go over some of the more complicated steps in detail such as the scoring rings and wiring the electronics. I will give you all the plans I used to build it, all of the parts, and finally I will also give you all of the software needed to make the game work on your PC. When you are finished you will have a fully functional electronic skee ball machine which uses a Flash interface, automatically keeps score, has sound effects, and a siren light turns on for a few seconds at the end of each game. Let me warn you from the start: this is not easy, cheap, or something you can do in one weekend. It takes endless hours of hard work to make this project. Each step has its challenges, but I'm here to help you through it. To make it easier on my wallet I purchased materials every couple of weeks as needed instead of all at once.\u00a0 Finally, what I want is to give you the tools and ideas to make your own table. I encourage you to experiment and to make your own small changes and adjustments along the way.\u00a0Main Materials list (*not a full list): 3 sheets 1/2\" plywood 4'x8' (MDF is also an option) 50' Rubber Cove Base\u00a0(found at Lowes/HD, or online) - this is the material for the rings. 1 roll of Cork 1/8\" - 18\"x25' (found on ebay. Only need around 10' so you'll have some extra) wood screws (various sizes) 1 welcome mat 22\"x34\" - this is really a cheap PVC foam pad - Home Depot 40 rivets 1/2\" 40 rivets 1/4\" 1x2 wood strips 8 feet long - lost count. Maybe 10 of these 2x2 wood strips 8 feet long - same, I think I used 3 of these 19\" monitor Speakers old PC - enough power to run a SWF file without hiccuping LEDWiz Controller +GP (groovygamegear.com) This is used for scoring, game controls, and future LED lighting. Red Siren Light (amazon) 1: SPDT relay switch 2: arrow shaped Pushbuttons - your choice of colors 1: rectangular pushbutton 1: round pushbutton for computer off switch 9: 2.5\" wooden balls \u00a0 7: cherry scoring switches (ebay) 20 gauge wire. At least two colors. One should be black. I went through about 40' of wire total. Felt (optional for sound dampening) Wood glue Frost King weather strips (a few small strips) 50 pack Female quick connectors (optional, you can also solder the connections) 40 1\" L shaped Corner Braces \u00a0 8 felt covered leveling screws (optional) 1 6-8' Power strip with at least three slots for powering all game parts. 2\" black Vinyl numbers \u00a0- 100, 100, 50, 40, 30, 20, and 10 (ebay)\u00a0Tools Needed: Jigsaw Circular Saw/Table Saw (Optional) Philips Screw Driver Drill Drill Press (optional) Soldering Iron\u00a0 Heat shrink tubing Wire Stripper/Cutter 3\" hole saw Rivet Gun Staple Gun (optional) Dremmel tool (optional) Sander Tiny flat-head screwdriver for connecting wires to the LEDWIZ All said and done this will cost around $5-600 depending on how much of these materials/tools you have laying around.

Using the attached ramp template, take two pieces of 1/2\" plywood scraps and clamp them together. Trace the pattern and cut the pieces using a jigsaw or scroll saw, Take your time, this stage is critical for the game to be playable. Once the shape is cut, sand them to be smooth and even. Next we attach 1x2\" cut so that when attached to the inside of the ramp shapes the total width is 18\". \u00a0Make sure the 1x2s are attached so that they on the curve and not sticking out above it. Next we will attach a sheet of plywood over the ramp. There is a technique we will now learn called kerfing. This helps the plywood to bend. Using a table saw I cut groves into the plywood evey 1/8\" or so. Just enough space between the cuts that is about the size of the cut itself. I did this for the length of the curved shape across the plywood. Once kerfed soak the plywood sheet in warm water for at least an hour. It should be bendable but still fairly strong. A helper is nice for this part. Starting at the top of the curve attach the plywood with small wood screws. Start to bend the plywood onto the curve and place screws in every few inches. Work slowly making sure not to crack the plywood. Once fully attached allow the plywood to dry for a day, As a precaution I filled in the kerf slots with homemade MDF. I took some sawdust (if you don't have any you will shortly), and mixed it with wood glue. I removed a few slats at a time and spread the wood glue/saw dust mix inside the groves. This adds strength as the ball will be hitting this ramp thousands of times over the course of many years. Filling the kerfs is optional, but strongly recommended. The final step is testing the ramp once dry. Don't worry about exposed screw heads at this point, but try to get them sunk into the plywood - carefully. This ramp will eventually be covered in cork. Consider this project officially under way - this is really one of the hardest parts of the whole machine. Don't worry, more challenges await. Side note: there are many alternate techniques for making the ramp. Due to my limited tool set this is how I did it. The previous link that I mentioned in the intro has an alternate method. Use which ever method you think is easier. If it works, it works.\u00a0 UPDATE - I do not like my ramp now that I have played it for a bit. The angle is too steep. The ramp would be better if it were more gradual and longer. If the ball hits it while slightly bouncing it reacts like it is hitting a wall. This should be tweaked from my directions and images. Make the ramp slope longer and more shallow!!!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FF7/FVPB/HINNZAOP/FF7FVPBHINNZAOP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTV/BU43/HINNZAEQ/FTVBU43HINNZAEQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJF/BM4G/HINNZAET/FJFBM4GHINNZAET.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI3/B1TP/HINNZAER/FI3B1TPHINNZAER.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2A/BEBE/HINNZAEL/F2ABEBEHINNZAEL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5I/78FM/HINNZAEM/F5I78FMHINNZAEM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG7/40IV/HINNZAES/FG740IVHINNZAES.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8Q/6XX3/HINNZAND/F8Q6XX3HINNZAND.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUT/40HU/HINNZAEP/FUT40HUHINNZAEP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYI/WFIL/HINNZAEO/FYIWFILHINNZAEO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6U/LC5S/HINNZAEN/F6ULC5SHINNZAEN.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: The Ramp"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The exact dimensions for this area is contained in the photos. I marked up the cut sheet of plywood. As you can see I made some on the fly adjustments so that the ring placement was to my liking. Finding the right materials for the rings is crucial for a realistic table. It turns out that 4\" Rubber Cove Base works wonderful. For durability I made mine loop around twice. The beginning of the loop and end of the loop should overlap by about 3/4\" where you will rivet them together. Keep adjusting the tightness of the rings and measure the diameter of them. The 100 rings are 3.4\" wide, the 50 ring is 4.6\", the 40 ring is 5\", the 30 ring is 5.8\", and the large ring that contains the 40 and 30 ring is 14.8\". \u00a0The final, large outer shape I didn't measure. I just laid the material out on the plywood and marked the cuts. To cut the base cove I just used a L shaped straight edge and a razor. Cut the base cove in multiple light passes, don't try to cut fully through it in one pass of the blade. Next I used tape to clamp the rings to make sure I measured correctly. Drilled a few holes and riveted the rings closed with two rivets. Sorry for a lack of progress photos but the end result should make the process clear. I placed the rings on the scoring area to make sure everything fits. Before attaching the rings I drilled the 3\" holes in the plywood. You can make the holes smooth by sanding them. I also took some felt and stapled it around the holes to further protect the wood balls. Once the rings are the right size and riveted, I took my L shaped corner braces and decided where to place them on the rings to attach them to the table. Mark the spots with a pencil and drill the pilot holes. I attached the one side of the clamp to the ring and riveted it in place, and connect the bottom of the brace to the table. See the photos for seam placement. Once the rings are attached to the table I wanted to add some PVC foam to dampen the sound of the ball hitting the wood. This is where the Welcome Mat comes into play. Using my favorite technique of cutting and taping construction paper, I was able to make templates for all of the areas needing foam. Once I had the construction paper shapes I placed them on the foam, traced them with a pencil, then carefully cut the foam shapes with a razor. I then put glue on the plywood and placed the foam in place. If the foam shapes don't fit perfectly then trim it with the razor before attaching. Had I thought ahead this would probably be a good time to attach the vinyl numbers to the rings. I waited to the end for that step. You now have the ramp and scoring area complete - the rest is a breeze compared to these steps..", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F25/MWRR/HINNZAQ4/F25MWRRHINNZAQ4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWB/3OYD/HINNZGP1/FWB3OYDHINNZGP1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDE/94DA/HINNZCF6/FDE94DAHINNZCF6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRS/51ZA/HINNZCF7/FRS51ZAHINNZCF7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSB/C5RL/HINNZCF8/FSBC5RLHINNZCF8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9V/LVVG/HINNZCF9/F9VLVVGHINNZCF9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1U/GNFF/HINNZCFA/F1UGNFFHINNZCFA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ3/HZHX/HINNZCFD/FJ3HZHXHINNZCFD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0J/N8RS/HINNZCFE/F0JN8RSHINNZCFE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNC/348G/HINNZAQ6/FNC348GHINNZAQ6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXX/K7A8/HINNZAQ5/FXXK7A8HINNZAQ5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0B/NBQX/HINNZCF5/F0BNBQXHINNZCF5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXC/CEZC/HINNZAQQ/FXCCEZCHINNZAQQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2F/RFUV/HINNZAQR/F2FRFUVHINNZAQR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV1/25KO/HINNZCEJ/FV125KOHINNZCEJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAB/IDFO/HINNZCF4/FABIDFOHINNZCF4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNS/CJ65/HINNZCFB/FNSCJ65HINNZCFB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJS/B5G5/HINNZCFC/FJSB5G5HINNZCFC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLN/R160/HINNZCFH/FLNR160HINNZCFH.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Rings and Scoring Area"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Using the measurements taken from the Google sketch-up model, it is time to fire up the Jigsaw.

You can learn what is going on for upcoming projects, or just follow the directions and it will work even if you don't know why. I am also going to give you a glimpse of the future of this project, which is what will make it over-the-top as promised. Take your LEDWIZ GP+ (make sure this is the model purchased or it will not work). It has 16 inputs and 16 outputs.  Here are the inputs we will be using: Scoring switches = 100 left, 100 right, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10 (0 gutter area ignored since this is a kid friendly game) Buttons = up button, select button, down button. This means we will only be using 10 of the 16 inputs. Connect your buttons and switches to the following slots on the Ledwiz:(Input)Slot 17 - 100 (Left side) Scoring Switch Slot 18 - 100 (Right side) Scoring Switch Slot 19 - 50 Scoring Switch Slot 20 - 40 Scoring Switch Slot 21 - 30 Scoring Switch Slot 22 - 20 Scoring Switch Slot 23 - 10 Scoring Switch Slot 24 - Up Arrow ButtonSlot 25 - RECT \"Select\" Button  Slot 26 - Down Arrow Button(Output) Slot 16 - SPDT Relay for Siren Light Output slots (16 available) We are only using slot 16 for the SPDT relay. The output slots actually output about 5v of power each. This power us supplied by the PC's molex power cable. You can use the USB power, but it isn't enough for this project.  The exciting future - the reason we are REALLY using the LEDWiz +GP over an iPac to convert the switches to keyboard keys: we are going to have full control over 14 LED lights. Each scoring hole will have two LED lights under it - one red and one blue. Future games will use this scoring ring lighting as part of the action. I don't have these games programmed yet or the LEDs connected, so this is going to be Phase two coming spring of 2014! For now we are just monitoring scoring switches and a few buttons. Let's say the 50 scoring switch is activated, this sends a keyboard key to the Flash game which is used to add the score total and also keep track of balls thrown. You need to install JOY2KEY software included. in the next step. Wiring the SPDT relay is tricky. I took my time and also used heat-shrink tubing. The part that connects to the LEDWiz doesn't matter which pin goes to the neutral and which pin connects to the hot wire, as long as one of the bottom pins connects to each. The top of the relay is pretty much the same. The power cord for the siren light must be examined. Look at the prongs and spot the small end - this is the hot side. The fat prong is the neutral. Somewhere along the cord for the light, cut the wire on the small prong side.  Think about it - with this wire cut the light, even if plugged-in, will not light since the wire is cut. This is where the relay comes in. The relay keeps this wire disconnect while in its normal state.

Just kidding, almost done. At this point you should add your vinyl numbers if you haven't done that already, create a PVC cage for the safety net if you are going to use one, and I also drilled some holes for the hidden speaker just above the monitor area. I just eyeballed the PVC cage using loose measurements. As long as it fits the size isn't an exact science here. The PVC is held together with super glue, but PVC cement is a better solution. Once I cut the PVC and built the cage I took it out back and spray painted it black with some Krylon plastic paint. I bought some nylon netting on ebay, and attached it to the cage with little, black Velcro straps. Once finished I went around and wood filled any screw holes. If screws were sticking out I would remove it, drill a countersink hole for it, and put it back in. Once filled I sanded the entire machine. I wish I spent more time sanding, as every blemish stands out now that it is painted. Sand sand sand - don't stop until smooth! Then it was masked, primed, and painted with a glossy black oil based paint. I should mention that I had to make a button to turn the PC on and Off. I just found the cord that connect to the power button on my PC, and sliced in my own pushbutton as described in step 5. This is located at the back of the machine in an easy to reach spot.

I got this project idea from science buddies.Please check out  www.sciencebuddies.com.  It's a great place for project ideas.Before I start the project, I discussed the concept of biomimicry. Simply, it means that engineers are trying to use what we find in nature to improve functions of man-made objects. A splendid example is velcro. It was invented by a man who went for a walk with his dog and came home with a lot of hooked burs from the local hills on his socks and his dog. He studied the burs and invented velcro.

He found these tiny hooks at the end of the things that were clinging to the stomach and eventually invented velcro. Can you believe it?Sciencebuddies.org used to have a wonderful lesson associated with this, but it's no longer available (at least I couldn't find it). So, I'll have to do my best to give you a short summary.The bumps on humpback whales' fins called tubercles (scalloped pattern) help the whales swim through the water easily.The spikes on sharks' skin called denticles (saw-tooth pattern) help the sharks slice through the water effortlessly.Scientists and engineers are working to incorporate these design elements to planes and ships, among other things. They believe that if we could put a thin skin of these patterns on our planes, it might cut our travel time over 50%!Imagine that!For this project, you need to cut out the three separate patterns, test them and figure out which pattern helps the whirly-bird slice through the air best.When I do this project in class, I'm the client and the students are aerospace engineers who are competing in teams to win a chance to build a revolutionary new aircraft.

I originally had only four servos to work the entire rocket. the problem is that the rocket can only move in four axes; this is problem when the rocket moves between axes. To solve this problem I offset another set of fins 45 degrees. This uses eight servos. I bought Common Sense R/C servos from Amazon.com for about $50.\u00a0\nThe offset is done by drawing a circle the same diameter as the body tube you made. You then draw a pair of perpendicular bisecting lines at the center of the circle. You then, using a Geometry compass, bisect all four of the angles. You then draw all of the angle bisectors until the line extends outside of the circle. Then line up the first four fins on the bottom of the rocket.

Once servos are lined up and fit in slits, use an Exacto knife to cut smaller slits for zip ties (also known as cable ties). I had to connect two ties together to make a bigger tie. Wrap tie around the servo and the plate and connect the last two ends of the tie until the servo is secure to the disk. Clip off the ends to clean up a bit.\nRepeat this process until all servos are secured to the disks.

Its stability is dependent on weight . Let the nose slightly heavier than the tail. You can set CG after putting weight (Battery , Receiver and Servos etc.) in sequence. Stability can be defined as a ball on top of hill if it slide any side it will slip down the hill and it cannot comes to its original position its called negative stability , a ball in valley if it slides from its position it will come to its position automatically its called positive stability & a ball on smooth terrain if it slide now it will remain maintain its second position till we set it to its original position this diagram is shown above.Equation of liftL=1/2 x p x v x v x A x Cl Wherep is the density of surrounding air    v is true air speed    A is plan form area      Cl is the coefficient. The coefficient is a number that determines the lift based on geometry or shape of the wing. This number changes with different angle of attack, and also with change in speed and air conditionBuild your plane wing the narrower from tips to reduce drag.Wings make more lift at higher angles of attack. Vertical tail must be back of the plane. The tail should be as far away from the center of gravity as possible, which usually mean back of the plane.If an air foil is curved then the wing will still produces some lift when the angle of attack is zero, but if it is symmetrical it will not produces any lift. This is why vertical tails usually have symmetrical airfoils, as it will not try to turn the plane when it flies in a straight line.Now, designing the tail of the aircraft it is the hard process.As a general rule aircraft's horizontal tails have lower aspect ratio than the aircraft's wings.The taper ratio of the horizontal tail can be similar to , between 0.3 and 0.6 you can check different aspect ration by changing the tail of the aircraft. Vertical tails usually have lower aspect ratio generally between 1 and 2 but they can be lower to 1, means the tail is longer than it is tall. A tail that is too big causes too much drag and slows the plane down. A tail that is too small will not be able to stabilize a plane, and may not be strong enough to stop it from crashing. When designing a tail for your model aircraft, it is safer to design a tail that might be too big. If it turns out your plane is too slow, you can try to reduce the size, but if you make it too small it's hard to fix, and could cause a spectacular crash that'll be even harder to fix!

Because of time constraints, the flag bases that I made were crude: thrown together quickly just to get the job done on time. Over the subsequent months, I used the displays for some campaign events and quickly became dissatisfied with their limitations. The flags were not firmly mounted; the display angle of the flag poles was fixed; and they included no weights to stabilize them. The new design corrects these deficiencies. I had three goals with my flag base design. 1. Secure support of the flags to maintain them in whatever position I chose to place them. 2. Adjustable display angle of the flag group(s) with reliable simultaneous control between vertical and whatever lower limit I established. 3. Inclusion of counterweights internally and/or externally. The new design accomplishes all of these, allowing the flag groups to be displayed at any angle between 90 degrees (vertical) and about 63 degrees. The angle is adjustable using a \u00be\u201d socket. I included internal weights and built additional external weights that can be easily carried like a briefcase and quickly attached to the rear of each base unit.", "title": "Flag Display Base: 7-Flag Adjustable Angle Bouquet", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Flag-Display-Base-7-Flag-Adjustable-Angle-Bouquet/", "section": "home", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "A.

After gluing a layer of \u00bc\u201d plywood to each side of a length of clear pine and allowing the glue to dry, the plywood/pine pivot assemblies are sawn apart and a 1\u00bd\u201d diameter hole sawn in each one. The sawn holes are then sanded smooth. The completed holes in the plywood/pine assemblies will be slightly larger than the outside diameter of the 1\u00bc\u201d PVC. To make them fit snuggly, I shimmed the annular space using card stock and/or cardboard strips. The typical space required two layers of cardboard. I carefully cut the two lengths such that the rings fit snuggly having neither a large gap nor overlapping ends that would lead to buckling of the ring when assembled. I test fitted the layers and then glued the layers together with the seams offset. I then glued the lap, coated the outer surface with glue, inserted the ring into the sawn and sanded hole, an inserted the PVC to hold it in place while the glue dried. I did not glue the PVC to the cardboard. After I had several pivot assemblies completed to the point of the cardboard shimming glued in place, I sanded the faces smooth to remove any cardboard extending beyond the plane of the \u00bc\u201d plywood. I then placed a group of them on a PVC pipe, clamped them together, and sanded all edge surfaces smooth to try to make them all the same profile. Later in the construction process, I realized the need to round the inner corners of the pivot assemblies. This was to allow more material remain in the upper cover and reduce stress at the reentrant corners of the notches. I did not document this rounding process photographically. I printed a pattern on card stock, mounted the pattern on cardboard, cut it out with a knife, and traced the curve on each assembly.

I sanded the outer surface of these plugs by mounting them in my drill press via a \u00bc\u201d bolt, steel washers, and a coupling nut. To drill the \u00bd\u201d diameter hole in the center of the plug, I made a drill jig from 2-by scrap following most of the same steps as plywood/pine pivot assemblies.

I located the shortest piece, marked it for drilling, and drilled the two 17/64\u201d holes spaced 5\u00bd\u201d on center. I used this first piece as a template for all of the others. My drill press vice has the capacity to clamp 7 stacked segments for simultaneous drilling. I placed the drilled template on top of\u00a0 6 undrilled segments and aligned the bit so I could drill through the template hole and into the others. After the first hole was complete, I inserted a \u00bc\u201d bolt to align these seven segments and adjusted the vice to allow me drill the holes at the other end. I repeated this process until I had all 28 segments drilled. To round over the ends of the links, I bolted groups of 7 segments together at both ends and clamped them in my bench vice for grinding. I then buffed the ground surfaces using my belt sander. Note that I only rounded over one corner at each end of the links, since rounding over the other corner is superfluous.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FF0/1HP3/HF243CKJ/FF01HP3HF243CKJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1C/VFX0/HF23MSOH/F1CVFX0HF23MSOH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEW/N7NG/HF23WI6B/FEWN7NGHF23WI6B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR5/Y4O7/HF23K241/FR5Y4O7HF23K241.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTE/263J/HF23M7WU/FTE263JHF23M7WU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPO/O857/HF23WI6E/FPOO857HF23WI6E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXO/VMBA/HF23T2MQ/FXOVMBAHF23T2MQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3J/QHVJ/HF23T2MR/F3JQHVJHF23T2MR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGH/7U8Q/HF23RKMO/FGH7U8QHF23RKMO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSM/DYKF/HF23K242/FSMDYKFHF23K242.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F91/GM75/HF23RKMP/F91GM75HF23RKMP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8E/GS48/HF243CLI/F8EGS48HF243CLI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3F/C39U/HF243CLP/F3FC39UHF243CLP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG8/TC06/HF23WI6R/FG8TC06HF23WI6R.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIF/RTL5/HF23WI6T/FIFRTL5HF23WI6T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUT/OKLB/HF240746/FUTOKLBHF240746.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Steel Lifting Links"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "I used hex head sheet metal screws as the pivot axles.

They include a threaded insert inside the bottom cap that allows them to be fastened to the bottom panel of the display base. To make the threaded inserts, I bevel-groove-welded coupling nuts to fender washers. Using a bench grinder, I beveled all six sides at one end of the coupling nuts; bolted the nuts and washers to a perforated steel angle for support; and welded the perimeters. It is very important to unbolt the nut-washer assemblies immediately after the welding is complete. If the nuts are allowed cool, the resulting shrinkage may cause them to grip the bolts tightly enough to make removal extremely difficult. I drilled \u00bc\u201d holes in PVC bottom caps. I then temporarily bolted the cooled nut-washer assemblies to the caps, drilled small holes for the mounting screws, and reamed the holes to countersink the machine screw heads that fastens the threaded insert flanges to the PVC caps. After cementing PVC caps with threaded inserts onto the pipes, I plugged the threaded inserts with the \u00bc\u201d mounting bolts, and supported the inverted pipes on wood blocking. I estimated the amount of concrete fill needed by calculating the volume of the pipe to be filled. Based on a concrete density of 145 pounds per cubic foot, I calculated the weight of this volume. Ignoring the weight of the mixing water, I measured the dry materials needed, placing them in a plastic bucket for mixing. As an engineer, I must emphasize the importance of minimizing how much water is used. It is very tempting to add water in order to make mixing easier, but this weakens the concrete. Use as little water as possible in order to produce a stiff cement paste within the aggregate (stone) matrix. Using a small trowel or similar implement, fill the pipes with concrete, allow them to cure until firm, and then remove the \u00bc\u201d bolt that is plugging threaded insert. If you wait too long to remove these bolts, you risk their becoming bonded to the curing concrete and difficult, if not impossible, to remove.

The display angle indicator consists of a roller-supported paper tape loop printed with a scale graduated in 1-degree increments. The loop is connected to a tab that extends from, and is actuated by, the central lifting disc. The paper tape is kept taut via a spring that pushes against the sliding support of the bottom roller. There are two rollers at the top of the assembly so this area of the graduated tape is displayed flat. The rollers are nylon bushings with bearings made from short segments of steel brake line. Fender washers keep the tape in place, and drywall screws fasten all of these components to the wooden support structure. The most challenging aspect of this part of the project is generating the scale to be printed on the tape. The nature of the lifting device results in a non-linear relationship between the vertical movement of the central lifting disc and the angle of the flag support pockets. In order to establish the mathematical relationship, I diagrammed the geometry; labeled the constants and variables; worked out the trigonometric relationships; and developed the associated equations. I entered these equations in a Microsoft\u00ae Excel spreadsheet that I created to generate the lift distance required to rotate the flag support pockets to each angle as measured from horizontal.

I decided to add these components after the first field test of the base units. The weights within the external counterweight units consist of concrete-filled 2\u201d PVC pipe with square end caps. Each external counterweight assembly contains 3 weights, which are held in place within wooden cradles. The units connect to the rear of the bases via vertical rails and a half dovetail. The half dovetail ledge pulls the counterweight tight to the base to align locking pins. I made the cradles by cutting each half to the correct cross section; clamping them together; marking the centers of the half-circle notches at the joint; cutting the notches with a hole saw; and sanding the holes with a drum sander in a drill press. Similar to the flag support pocket upper pivot assemblies, I used layers of card stock and cardboard to create shims to allow the assembled cradles to firmly grip the concrete-filled pipes. I wrapped scrap pipe sections with shim material and tested the fit in the sawn holes. After the shims were dry, I split them into halves and glued them into the cradle with which they were test-fit. I put the scrap pipe sections in place, assembled the two halves of the cradle, and clamped them together while the glue dried. I then cut the assembled cradles to the correct length. I cut the enclosure panels to size, glued the bottom panel to the front panel of each counterweight assembly; glued and screwed one half of the cradle pairs to this bottom-front assembly; and glued and screwed installed the handle backer block between the cradles. I cut a rectangular hole with rounded corners in each top, sanded these holes smooth, and rounded over the exposed edges. These holes serve as recesses for the carrying handles. I then glued and screwed the top in place. I glued and screwed the remaining pairs of weight support cradles to the rear cover. The rear cover assembly fastens in place using 3\u00bd\u201d deck screws, firmly clamping the 3 pipe weights in place. I incorporated two options for locking the exterior counterweights to the rear of the flag base units \u2013 \u00bc\u201d bolts and \u00bc\u201d cotterless detent pins \u2013 because I didn\u2019t know which one I would prefer. The locking fasteners pass through holes in locking rails on the rear covers of the flag bases and into holes in locking rails on the front covers of the external counterweights. These holes are reinforced with steel washer plates made from \u215b\u201d-thick steel flat stock that is fastened to the wood structure using deck screws. To hold the \u00bc\u201d bolts in place when not in use, each inner washer plate of the flag base locking rails include a nut welded in place to serve as a threaded insert. This allows the bolts to be threaded out to the \u201cunlocked\u201d position and stored there until needed.

Deduct 2\" total from the width of the space where you are mounting the rack to figure out how long your rods should be. Example: my space is 20\", so I needed 18\" rods. I also used a mitre box to cut the rods, but only out of habit. It's totally unnecessary.)DrillingMark the locations where you will be drilling your rod holes. To do this, first mark the top of each side so you can keep properly oriented. Next, mark a centre line on the inside surface of both blocks. Finally, mark the drill hole centre points: make the first mark .5\" from the top of the side, and then each 2\" apart from there. You will end up with 6 points, at .5\", 2.5\", 4.5\", 6.5\", 8.5\", and 10.5\" respectively.Using a drill press, set it so the holes will be at 1/2\" depth, and drill out all the points you've marked.

I have a finishing blade on my table saw which makes for fairly smooth cuts, and the dowels were nice & smooth, so I was able to start with 120 grit sandpaper, and then 150 grit. That was all the sanding I did for the sides, but I finished with 220 grit on the rods, to make sure my ties were on an extra smooth surface. When sanding the rods, start by palming the sandpaper and rotating the dowel ends in your palm, like you were trying to start a fire (see pictures), and then wrap your hand around the rod and sand using long strokes while rotating the rod. (Your mileage may vary: Depending on how rough your wood is to start, you may have to start sanding with an 80 grit or 100 grit first. Use your discretion here.Pro tip: after sanding the dowel rods with the highest grit you plan to use, wipe off the sawdust with a slightly damp rag. This will not only remove the dust from the sanding, but it will make any loose fibres stand up. Then sand them again with the same highest grit sandpaper, and wipe them well (almost buffing them) with paper towel. This will give you an ultra-smooth surface! FinishingTo finish the rack I used a single coat of acrylic polyurethane finish. I did this mainly to ensure the smooth surface stays smooth, and because I didn't want to use an oil based finish on a surface my ties would sleep on for months, if not years, at a time. I don't know if it matters, but I figure better safe than sorry. Once dried (less than an hour), I gave the rods another once-over with 220 grit sandpaper. So smooth. So sweet.

I marked out a slice off the outside face of the side pieces that would be on the outside of the rack) and cut it off using a band saw. To allow for a smooth drop, I rounded off the top edge of the arm so it wouldn't catch as it swung down.Next, I had to figure out a way to create a stop at the end of the swing. To do this, I used a drawing compass and drew a 3/4 circle at the bottom end of the arm, and drew the stop line from the end of the arc to the edge of the arm. Cut out the shape. This produces two pieces: the long arm, and a short end with a half circle cut out of it.(Your mileage may vary: I used a band saw to cut this out, but if you don't have one you could cut this with a fine-toothed hand saw and a slight change to the shape). Glue the short piece back onto the end of the board and clamp tight. Let it sit according to your glue's instructions.Using the centre mark from the compass, drill a 5/64\" hole and ream it so the screw that will attach the arm to the side will sit flush with the surface of the wood. Put the arm in place and carefully line up the edges, and use the previously drilled hole as a guide to drill a pilot hole into the side piece where the arm will attach. Enlarge the hole in the arm piece with a 5/32\" drill bit. To give a bit of glide to the action of the arm, rub some wax (I used brown crayon) onto the curved edge of the arm where it will travel along the curved butt end of the side piece, and rub it smooth it with a paper towel. Attach the arm to the side piece, being sure to place the washer (optional) in between the two pieces. Do NOT use a drill to screw the arm down or you will split the wood. That is what the screwdriver is for: tighten by hand to avoid splitting the wood.As a final touch, put a finishing nail in the top end of the arm. This will act as a stop for the arm and prevent it from swinging up past it's intended resting position.In the pictures above you can see the arm's fully extended position, and how the stop works.

Find a couple of small scraps of wood and use them as clamping surfaces to make sure the two pieces stay aligned vertically with one clamp. Use a second clamp to push the two pieces together, putting force perpendicular to the split. Clamp lightly at first, until you are sure the clamps and wood are exactly where you want them, but are firmly in place.

After I drilled my hole (approximately 1/2\" deep), I decided I wanted my rack to sit inwards as much as possible, but still rotate without the end of the side piece catching on the stop block above, or the drywall behind. To do this I held the piece at a 45 degree angle to the wall and stop block, and then outwards along that line by about 1/16\". This positioning allowed for a full swing of the rack without any corners rubbing on the wall or stop block.To determine where to drill the \"fixed\" hole on the opposite side, put a short dowel into the side piece, and hang the piece in the mounting hole. Mark the top and rear of the hanging piece and measure the distance from those marks to the floor, and from the rear wall. Transfer those measurements to the other side and again, using the side piece as a guide, score the hole with the drill & forstner bit. Drill this hole a little deeper than the first, and ream it out a little on the back side so that the dowel will be able to enter in on a slight angle. This will be necessary in order to mount the rack.Then, going back to the other side again, I drilled another hole directly above the first, er, second hole -but first good hole- and used a chisel to create an entry path for the exterior dowel in order to be able to mount the fully assembled rack.

You can tailor the project so that it is a simple 2 class assignment or you can build it into something with all sorts of hand-on-learning. I've tied this project into electronics, math and aeronautics. Best of all the kids learn all this stuff through experience and learning with their hands. I'll be using this project next rotation with my grade 7 math kids AND my grade 6 tech classes.\u00a0 The reason it is so fast is simple.... it doesn't carry the battery. Power is supplied by the wires leading to the airplane. This means you can get crazy with motors and props but not have to worry about weight. Here's what you'll need. I'll go over the details in the text but i always give options and ways to make it simpler or more complicated... For the Airplanes You'll need: -An assortment of small electric DC motors... 3-9 volts... -An assortment of propellors... whatever you can find. -Thin, 3mm foam sheets or foam trays from your butcher. -Balsa stick, about 16\" long by 3/16\" by 1/4\" -Wire 22G stranded, about 2 feet. -5 minute epoxy -1/16\" welding wire or piano wire -small plastic wheels. Tools: -Wire cutters -X-Acto knife -Sharpie, rulers -small clamps -soldering pencil, solder. -Power supply... a variable type with at least 12volts at 2 amps would be good. If not around, just use a battery. -If you want to get into electronics, at least one multimeter. For the Tether Pole You'll need: -1\" dowel 3 feet long, 1/4\" dowel\u00a0 1 foot -3' square 1/2\" plywood -2 skateboard bearings -22 G enameled wire... about 40 feet. -22 G stranded wire... about 30 feet. -5 minute epoxy -A handful of wood screws.

The width of the wing from leading edge to trailing edge is called the CHORD.\nThe length of the body of the airplane (called the FUSELAGE) should be about 70-75% of the wing length.\u00a0\nThe distance from the leading edge of the wing to the propeller should be about 15% of the wingspan. (wing length)\nThe distance from the leading edge of the wing to the horizontal stabilizer should be about 3 times the chord of the wing.\nThe horizontal stab should be about 25% of the wing area.\nThe vertical stabilizer should be about 10% of the wing area.\nThe plane should balance at about 25-33% of the wing chord.\nFor older kids i will discuss the proportions than let them loose.

Because we are running thin wires and we wish to conserve power (environmental stuff, dont'cha know.)\u00a0 We need to use a motor and prop combination that has maximum pull with the least use of power.\nWhat i do is set the kids up with a multimeter, show them the difference with setting up the meter depending on whether we want to measure volts or amps and let the kids loose. I get them to write a number on the motor, take a note of voltage that is suggested by the manufacturer and keep an eye on current as the voltage is changed. We just clamp them in a vice. At one point the motors will usually start screaming or the amps just pin the PS to max.\nI really would suggest letting the kids discover for themselves at this point. Show them how to make a table and graph the results, or maybe let them draw how the motor is reacting with cartoons... whatever... HANDS ON is the key phrase.\nGive them at least 40 minutes than introduce the propellers. Run the same tests but ask the kids to figure out which prop works best with which motor. It is kind of subjective but the kids can feel how hard the motor pulls with a given prop while keeping an eye on the efficiency of the motor. If the motor has to scream to produce power the prop is wrong.\nEnd result? Have each kid/team decide on a motor and prop combination and ask them to present the findings to the class.

I'll go\u00a0 into that in awhile.\u00a0 Juice the motor to see what happens. Flip the power wires if it flies backwards and tries to attack you. Very powerful and efficient setups will have the airplane in the air in a 1/2 rotation. Don't worry if the airplane falls over... keep on with the power and as it gains speed it will start pulling out and stabilizing.\nIncrease speed gradually.\u00a0 One thing that is fun to do is decrease than increase power... the airplane will fall than climb more and more... if you keep doing this it will crash, which is kinda cool. The kids LOVE it.\nSo... the students always ask HOW FAST IS IT GOING???? my answer is... well... what do YOU think? Let them guess, write it on the board. Tell them to figure it out. What I do is this...\n-Ask them what makes up a speed measurement? (distance/time)\n-How do we figure out the distance? (stepping off the circle, measuring using yardsticks, using a long piece of string...) I guide them to using MATH to figure it out... They can easily measure the RADIUS using the length of the wire... Once they do that they can use 2(pi)r to find the circumference. MAKE SURE to NOT give answers. Let THEM figure it out! What works well is to get the students to write the answers on the board and compare them.\nThe second part is TIME. most kids get this pretty quick so fire up the airplanes and get the kids to pull out the iphones to measure time in seconds per loop. Get them to write the results on the board than find an average.\nDepending on the grade level, you can either tell them to multiply m/s by 3.6 to get km/hr OR you can get them to figure it out. Here's an example...\nOur flying circle has a radius of 4 meters. This means 2(3.14)(4) which is roughly 25 meters in circumference. The kids timed the last run i filmed at 1.63 seconds. this means the speed was 25/1.63 which is about 15m/s. Multiply this by 3.6 and the airplane was moving at about 55 km/hr. Thats pretty fast, esp when i explain to the kids that 50km/h is the average speed limit on our roads.\nHere is an excellent math description on how to do it... It is from \"Yahoo Answers\"First we'll convert from meters per second to meters per hour.\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute, so there are\n60 x 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour. To go from meters per second to meters per hour we have to multiply meters per second by 3600.\n15 m/s = (15x 3600) m/h = 54,000 m/h\nStep 2) To switch from meters per hour to kilometers per hour we use the fact that there are 1000 meters in a kilometer. Thus we have to divide m/h by 1000 to get km/h.\n54,000m/h = (54,000/ 1000) km per hour\n= 54 km per hour. <<<<<\nMakes sense, doesn't it?\nyou can do this either by explaining it or getting the kids to work through it as you give hints along the way...\nI'll move to building the tether...

Specifically, this gimbal is used for a GoPro camera to allow for smooth and stable recording. The gimbal keeps the camera level by pivoting around it. An inertial measurement unit (IMU) records the pitch, yaw, and roll of the camera. Using three brushless motors placed on the 3 different axes around the camera, the gimbal moves the three separate motors to stabilize the camera by counteracting the changes in the pitch, yaw, and roll as measured by the IMU. When the IMU detects changes on these axes, the motors cancel it out. This is done using algorithms that can differentiate between deliberate camera movement and unwanted shake. Gimbals can be mounted to vehicles such as drones, where vibrations or other unexpected movements would make such shots unusable. Gimbals are also useful in photography, specifically when long range telephoto lenses are used: a gimbal rotates such a lens around its center of gravity, allowing for smooth adjustment while tracking moving subjects at a far distance.MaterialsUSAQ Storm32 V1.31 32-Bit BGC 3-Axis Brushless Gimbal Controller Motor Driver with MPU6050https://www.amazon.com/USAQ-Storm32-Brushless-Cont...(x3) 2804-210Kv Brushless Gimbal Motorhttps://www.amazon.com/2804-210Kv-Brushless-Gimbal...3000mAh Super Polymer Rechargeable Battery 02 US Plughttps://www.amazon.com/3000mAh-Super-Polymer-Recha...9 Printed Pieces (files links under 'Printing the Parts' section)  (x4) M1 Bolt and Nut 12mm, (x4) M2 Bolt 8mm, (x4) M3 Bolt 4mm, (x2) M3 Bolt 6mmReferenceshttp://www.olliw.eu/storm32bgc-wiki", "title": "3D Printed 3-axis GoPro Gimbal ", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/3D-Printed-Gimbal-3000-Draft/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The mounting parts for this handheld gimbal are a combination of 3D printed parts designed by us and parts designed by Velocirotor in their thingverse page titled \"Primbal V3.\"  As explained earlier, one of the most crucial features of a gimbal is camera balance when the motors are off.  Obtaining a well-balanced gimbal requires prototyping and testing mounts until the desired balance is achieved.  Since the time frame of this project was constricted, we decided to use a previously designed and tested motor/camera mounting system.  The previously designed parts were made to be ultimately mounted on a drone, rather than a handle for holding. This is where we had to step in and design our own base and handle for the gimbal.

The download link can be found here.  On this website you can find a much more in-depth discussion of the Storm32, its settings and calibration procedure, but we will outline the process here.  Before you attach your Storm32 board and IMU to your gimbal, make sure that you do a 6-point calibration for both the IMU and the board.  Pictured below is our setup to do the calibration.  Make sure that you have some very level surface to do the calibration on and and some thing to keep it steady in 6 directions.  A good video of the process can be found here.  Essentially you will be going to the \"Calibration Acc\" tab, clicking \"Run 6-point Calibration\" and orienting your IMU/board in six directions and storing the values.  Make sure that you only record the values once the sensors have settled.  It is important to try and keep the sensors from any strong jolts or vibrations during this step or else you will have a poorly calibrated gimbal.  Once you've made the calibrations, make sure to save them somewhere and write them to the board.Now that your sensors are properly calibrated, you are ready to start setting up and tuning your gimbal.  However, before you do any of the following steps, make sure that the gimbal is properly balanced.  A properly balanced gimbal should not move from the position you initially placed it in, no matter how you twist or turn it or heavily shake it. We recommend disconnecting the motors, then balancing the roll axis first, then the pitch, and yaw last.  balance on the yaw axis is the least important of them all so it can be more approximate.  We found that with our design, the yaw axis balance could have been better, but that can be remedied by extending the length of the yaw arm.  Once your gimbal is balanced, reconnect the motors and open up the Storm32 GUI.  Make sure that the IMU is properly reading values in the \"Data Display\" Window (pitch, yaw, roll values are updating as expected).  We will now run the gimbal configuration tool and then tune our setup.  Run the setup, making sure that it fully completes the process, the board will emit a loud beep then start vibrating when complete.  Your gimbal is now operational and just needs to be tuned.  If you were unable to complete the configuration steps, make sure that all of your motors are plugged into the correct ports, that they are all operational and that your power source has enough juice to power your motors (>10V).  Also check that your balance is correct.  If you still aren't completing the setup process, try adjusting your PID settings as outlined below and retry.  You can skip to the PID step by de-selecting \"step II\" in the procedure.  Other troubleshooting can be found on the Storm32 wiki.Tuning the PIDsNow we are going to set the PID values for each of the motors (Proportional Integral Derivative).  Make sure to turn off the motors not currently being used.  We suggest tuning pitch then roll then yaw.  Navigate to the PID tab and turn all values (P,I and D) to zero.  We will first set Vmax.  You want Vmax to be as low as possible such that it can still cope with any forces you expect your gimbal to encounter (wind, swerves, etc.) but not be too strong and induce shaking or vibrations.  This should be approximately good when the motor resists you moving it slightly, but doesn\u2019t inhibit movement too much.  Once you have set Vmax, we will now adjust the D values.  We want to raise D as high as possible without introducing jitters, whining sounds or large vibrations.  You\u2019ll know when your D value is good when the camera smoothly snaps from one magnet alignment to another when you push on it.  Make sure that you are always writing the changes to the board.  After D we will move to the P value.  The P value sets how much the camera should adjust to changes in its position, and again we want it to be as high as possible.  To tune the P, make sure to set I to as low as possible without it being zero (5 or 30).  When you\u2019re adjusting P, you want a smooth transition from being moved away from the rest position back to the rest position. Make sure that there aren\u2019t any jitters or high pitch whining sounds.  You want a smooth transition.  Finally we will raise the I value as high as possible without introducing shaking or vibrations.  The I value will help the gimbal snap quickly back into position and respond to movements.  With these tuned and done for each motor, you should now have a fully functioning gimbal.  Once you\u2019ve re-enabled all of the motors, make sure that you wait ~10 seconds for the setup process to run before moving it.  After that, you will hear a loud beep meaning that the motors are running and the gimbal is operating.Some good sources:http://www.olliw.eu/storm32bgc-wiki/Getting_Startedhttp://www.olliw.eu/storm32bgc-wiki/Calibration  http://www.olliw.eu/storm32bgc-wiki/Tuning_Recipe", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2B/M5SK/JGSGEB90/F2BM5SKJGSGEB90.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCB/B3ZA/JGSGEBAG/FCBB3ZAJGSGEBAG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Balancing and Calibrating the Gimbal"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "Finally, use a non-permanent(or permanent) adhesive to fix the controller board onto the platform in it's housing.

I also tried several SeeedStudio modules and versions based on the MPU9150 and MPU9250. The latter chip is named 10DOF (Degrees Of Freedom) for it adds a barometer (single axis) to the gyroscope (3-axis), accelerometer (3-axis) and magnetometer (3-axis). All 3 chips have a Digital Motion Processor (DMP) on board.  There\u2019s a big advantage in using this processor. It saves a lot of coding on the calculation of the vertical angle (sensor fusion and filtering). Secondly it has a build-in calibration routine. And last but certainly not least: it saves use of the cpu and memory of the Arduino. The InvenSense  documentation, even in their \u2018Developers Corner\u2019, is not helping much if you want to   use  DMP in combination with an Arduino. Jeff Rowberg has published a great hack for the MPU6050 registers here  This library works only for the MPU6050 and MPU9150. The registers of the MPU9250 are configured differently. While testing with the MPU9150 chip, DMP occasionally stopped working (could be the chip). Finally the MPU6050 gave the best results. (Other advantages: these modules are the smallest,  thinnest and very low priced.)If the MPU6050 produces erroneous data, one might want to calibrate the sensor x,y,z-offsets of the chip. An Arduino sketch for calibrating offsets can be found hereI experienced that tuning the offsets improve the accuracy at small angles but also decrease the accuracy at large angles. At the end-of-the-day the chips default offsets worked best most of the times.   Motors, encoders, motor drivers  and wheelsMotors I used (all Pololu):High Power Micro  no 1101,  990 rpm, gear: 100.37:1, stall torque: 30 oz/inHigh Power            no 2271,  990 rpm, gear:     9.68:1, stall torque: 39 oz/inHigh Power            no 2274,  210 rpm, gear:      100:1, stall torque: 80 oz/inLow  Power            no 2282,  590 rpm, gear:     9.68:1, stall torque: 17 oz/inExcept for the micro version, all motors come with hall encoders attached. They produce an easy-to-work with resolution of 464 to 2248 ticks depending on the gear ratio. For the micro motors I used optical encoders producing 48 ticks. In my view for indoor use torque is less important. Also I experienced the high power versions as harder to tune. They have a larger stiction (\u2018dead power zone\u2019 = amount of power needed to start moving) and therefor I found it harder to adjust power at tiny differences in balance  (i.e. small vertical angles).  Rpm is directly related to a maximum speed. In my view also of lesser importance for building a balancer for the first time. However a very low rpm makes it almost impossible to reach steady balancing. My advice: use average motors, preferably with around 600 rpm.    Overall the DC motors, although from the same series, showed different and non-consistent stiction. Building in differential control turned out to be  essential. Maybe stepper motors will reduce this problem (they move until a position or angle is reached). Stepper motors also remove the need for encoders.      I\u2019ve done tests with a L298N dual (2A) motor controller board and a Seeed Studio 4A motor controller shield. I prefer the latter for it\u2019s a shield. Easy to mount and it takes less space. Furthermore: I found the shields 4Amp a better buffer for the stall current of the high power motors. (Note: Mind the pinout in my Arduino sketch. I experienced the shields wiring to be different from the Seeed example.) Wheels can really make your life easy. I\u2019ve used diameters of 4.2, 9 and 12 centimeter. Large wheels bring more stability. This also applies to the grip on the surface. My favorites: the \u2018Wild Thumper\u2019 wheels (12x6 cm).   Height and weight are also important for the behavior of the bot. A large weight will make the bot inert: reacting slow and therefor show large overshoots in the beginning. And certainly high powered motors are then needed. A higher center of gravity (COG) will make the robot more stable, but there are possible consequences too. Height, in combination with significant weight at the top, will also make the robot inert. So it\u2019s all a matter of tuning. When the robot is balancing stable but you find it reacting slow when moving forward or backward, try reducing weight and/or bringing some weight down. PowerThis bot is powered by 2 LiPo batteries. One for powering the Arduino and the motors. One for powering the Raspberry and through that the UltraBorgs with the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors. I started with just one source for all components. When the motors were on \u2018heavy duty\u2019 they drew so much current that the ultrasonic readings became erroneous and even the RPi sometimes performed a reset. Using a separate LiPo for the RPi and Ultraborgs solved that, but I had to add a UBEC to get a steady current of 5V 3A .", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FHC/V55K/J4SPT1KS/FHCV55KJ4SPT1KS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF1/FF9E/J4SPT1JH/FF1FF9EJ4SPT1JH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXB/2Y0M/J4SPT1KT/FXB2Y0MJ4SPT1KT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0I/C6GR/J4SPT1I7/F0IC6GRJ4SPT1I7.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Hardware"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "There\u2019s a lot of information on balancing robots and/or the inverted pendulum available on the web. However I used a very simplified logic with the following assumptions:1 - The angle by which the motor axis should turn, is (at least) the same as the angle by which the robot is falling. So try to control the angle of the motor axis instead of a distance and/or a speed. (Which, as said, might be easier to realize when using stepper motors.) 2 - For balancing, control of the angle and its derivative, the angular speed of the motor axis, is needed. This can be done by using a PD control loop. Not as common as a PID loop, but since the direction of the movement will be changing rapidly, the use of an integral factor is hardly usefull. 3 \u2013 To keep position the horizontal movement and speed have to be controlled. This can be done by translation of the sensor (encoder) output into a compensating angle. The control loop needed is also a PD loop for the same reason as the vertical control.The results of 2 and 3 could simply be added, but it\u2019s better to use nested (cascaded) control loops where the horizontal control loop  produces a target angle for the vertical  control loop.   Working by these assumptions saves the burden of calculations with the height and the mass (or even the linear velocity) of the robot (as said: those are important factors but can easily be tuned). This way it\u2019s relatively easy to adjust height and COG of the robot without changing (much of) the coding parameters.Keeping the robot straight faced is done through differential control (turning) and can be done independently of the horizontal and vertical control. The input could come from the encoders (i.e. difference in amount of ticks) or from the IMU (i.e. yaw data). The latter needs much less coding.To wrap it up, for balancing one need to : 1          Translate the horizontal displacement into a vertical angle 2          Compensate the difference between that angle and the angle measured3          Move the motor axis by this compensating angle For translation into code some features of the robot are needed: The maximum motor speed expressed in encoder ticks. This is the maximum of ticks the encoders can produce with a certain motor. In formula: RPM / 60 * ticks per revolutionThe relation between encoder ticks and degrees. In formula: 360 / ticks per revolutionWith these two we can deduce the relation between degrees and motor power (PWM value 0-255 ). An Arduino sketch operates as robot 'firmware' with the following functionality:Horizontal control depending on input from the wheel encoders Vertical & differential control based on IMU input (pitch & yaw) Bluetooth communication for tuning, output monitoring and motion testing Serial communication with the Raspberry PiThe sketch is available here. The android app for remote control and tuning has been made with the MIT App Inventor and the blocks can be found here. The Python scripts for communication and control between the Raspberry and the Arduino are available in the same repository. I won\u2019t elaborate on those now for this post is meant for the balancing fundamentals only. The Arduino sketch is well commented for explanation. So I will only touch on its functions shortly.InitializingThe pins of the UNO are well occupied, leaving not much room for connecting sensors to the Arduino (pwm, interrupt and analog pins are sold out). Some robot/motor constants to do the calculations (described above).Slack or stiction constants. Gathered by trial and testing. I started with a sketch to obtain average values under no-load conditions. You\u2019ll find it here. In practice I adjusted them significantly based upon observations while testing the balance and movements. These constants will suffice but are highly depending on the behavior of the motors. Skipping these amounts of power makes the robot more responsive at (very) small angles. But setting these values too high will create some challenges while tuning the control loops!maxAngleThe angle where compensation is assumed impossible. It is used to determine if the robot is standing up or laying down.IntervalA steady interval is essential for the control loops. There\u2019s a \u2018TimedAction\u2019 library available on the Arduino site, but straight forward coding of one timer is just as simple and saves some memory.pitchOffsetObtained by tuning the IMU. Most simple way this can be done, is fixating the robot in an absolute 90 degrees position (measured by a digital level on top) and read the IMU-values.cogOffsetWithout this constant the control loops will also obtain balancing. The first prototype carried 8 ultrasonic sensors which made it a bit heavy at the front. As you can see in the video the control loops adjust this by letting the robot lean back a little. Using a cogOffset compensates the leaning and makes the robot a bit more agile in moving forward.Serial.begin() and Bluetooth.begin()Communication with the RPi is done through USB-serial. The SoftwareSerial wiring library is used for the Bluetooth communication with the Android app.wdt_enable(WDTO_500MS)When something went wrong in initializing the IMU, the Averdude Watchdog Timer is set which will force a reset of the Arduino.  resetRobot()Initializes all variables (and stops the motors) every time the robot is laying down. This is helpful when picking up the robot.loop()As long as the robot is standing up all inputs are checked. When the interval has passed the control loops are executed. I\u2019ve experimented with a different intervals. The optimum is depending of the sensors and type of motors used. Beyond 100Hz (< 0.01 sec) I experienced erroneous encoder data and the robot also acted  a bit too \u2018spicy\u2019. At 50Hz the robot became \u2018sluggy\u2019. In most cases a 100Hz loop worked best.horizontalControl()Checks if the target distance has been made and adds a speed offset to the target ticks. The speed offset is the amount of ticks to be made during an interval at a certain velocity. If no distance and speed targets are set, the target amount of ticks is set at the rising of the robot. This enables the robot to return to its position (or new position if it was ordered to move for a certain distance). differentialControl()This is a bit special for the yaw output of the IMU is used here. The IMU returns - \u03c0 <= yaw <= \u03c0 (radians).The getAngles() routine turns the reading into an angle in degrees on a 0-360 scale. The resetRobot() routine sets the yaw-angle at the rising of the bot as yawTarget (basically an angle-offset on a 360 degree scale). The difference between the last angle reading and the offset is treated as error. Pretending a scale of 360 degrees (like on a compass) makes it easy to determine the smallest angle (=direction to turn). The outcome can simply be added to and subtracted from the amount of power send to the individual motors depending on the direction (left/right) to compensate and depending on the direction (forward/backward) the bot will have to move. The next 3 routines are only executed when a command is received through Bluetooth or from the Raspberry in the getMessage() routine.setSpeed()Takes a percentage of the maximum amount of ticks the motors can produce in one interval (= RPM / 60 * ticks per revolution * interval in seconds).setDistance()Multiplies the distance to run in meters with the amount of ticks per meter (= Ticks per revolution / wheel perimeter in meters)setTurn()Adds the desired amount of degrees to the yaw offset, adjusts the new target to a 360 degrees scale and resets the turn command to prevent continuous turning.The sensor and motor routines are pretty straight forward. The resetEncoders() routine prevents accidents caused by a \u2018roll over\u2019 of the encoders (encoder output is in integers). The interaction routines check the serial and Bluetooth queues for new commands and if so handle those through a common case structure.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FW0/XA32/J4SPT1M5/FW0XA32J4SPT1M5.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Logic & Coding"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "For obvious reasons PID-tuning is sometimes called a dark art.  The process can be very tiresome and frustrating. Although there are a number of semi-structured methods of obtaining controller values, manual tuning is almost always unavoidable to get the bot balancing.Some considerations that will help here:This process requires patience and observation: if a gain value is changed, which behavior can be observed?   The Proportional gain stands for the Power of the compensation. I.e. the amount of motor power supplied.   Derivative  gain stands for Damping the effect of the power supplied.   Keep in mind that it\u2019s all about acceleration. Power supplied shortly delivers acceleration.   Start with both gains at zero and then start increasing the P(ower) with small steps. Stop when the bot stays more or less up by its own. Maybe too \u2018shaky\u2019 or \u2018waggling\u2019 but it should keep itself up for a couple of seconds. (Often referred to as \u2019steady oscillation\u2019.)   If you really cannot get to steady oscillation, there\u2019s probably a physical cause. Some possible signals are: uneven amplitudes (which could point to a cog, mass or height problem) or only moving in one direction (which could be a lack of motor power)     When the bot oscillates heavily (makes large, wild moves forward and backward) and the moves get wilder and wilder, the acceleration is too big because too much power has been suppliedWhen the bot starts running faster and faster in one direction to end in a crash, the bot cannot accelerate enough due to insufficient power supplied.   Steady oscillation implies constant overshoot like sitting on a swing. With adding D(amping) the overshoots will decrease (and finally fade).   Use small steps, keep the values as small as possible and observe the effects thoroughly.Life becomes a bit less tough when the gains can be adjusted from outside the sketch (otherwise one has to edit, recompile and rebuild the sketch over and over again).   I started with 2 trim pots to adjust the gains. I found them hard to use. Because I started with no idea about the gain values, I had to edit the sketch many times for a new scaling (?.???? : 1024) and without a direct visual feedback on the values, I had no clue of the changes I made by turning the pots.   The android app worked best for me: almost all constants can be changed by just entering a value. The top of the screen gives an overview of all current values. At the bottom of the screen one can get a graphical display of the error or the angle itself. Mind that such a display is just a delayed (Serial and Wifi) indication and not a real live feedback. The app can also be used for testing some commands (distance, speed, turns).Once I had reached the ball park figures, I felt the need for some semi-automated testing tools because almost every change to the robot or its code requires more or less re-tuning. Especially working on the horizontal control loop required that several times. I wrote a Python script that uses a coordinated ascent algorithm often referred to as \u2018twiddle\u2019 algorithm. An explanation of the algorithm by Sebastian Thrun (Udacity, Google, Stanford) can be found hereThe script can be found here: twiddleVert.pyI tried to build the algorithm in the Arduino sketch. Although it just fitted into the available 32K of memory, it delayed the overall cycle too much. So the script is meant to run on the Raspberry and uses some other Python scripts:control.py for sending commands to the Arduino and I2C communication with the  UltraBorgs. If no Ultraborgs are attached the import and initializing could best be commented out. Otherwise UltraBorg.py is also needed.messaging.py  which is a threading class for the actual communication with the ArduinolinkingStorage.py which acts as shared memory between the main script and the threaded scriptmeasurements.py  for gathering, displaying and saving all test data.Note: The Python scripts will change due to further experiments. If you want to avoid changes clone the repository.I think all fundamentals are covered by now and will hopefully help you in building your own balancer.

So typically people use balsa wood, foam that has good strength per weight. To make the structure, even more, stiffer carbon fiber is used for reinforcement. It has enough strength to take big banding loads.Among various materials, paper is never considered to make RC planes. It can be used to make simple planes having the size below around 15-20 cm. As size increases the stiffness of plane tends to decrease and any aerodynamic force would tend to bend it that spoil it's aerodynamic. And powering it with electronic having weight of around 80-100 g is even more difficult.In this instructable, I tried to make an RC plane with typical electronic having around 140g flying weight and 80cm of wingspan.In step 1, I explained various design or approaches that I initially considered and tried to make a small prototype to understand structural strength.In step 2, I tried to briefly cover partially successful design made out of paper.Step 3 onwards, I covered design and procedures for making the final paper plane.

This approach is not very good to have strength. But the major problem with this approach is that not only aerodynamic force but also humidity ( or drying glue) would create lots of bending and twisting that make flying this plane impossible. Even in the image this twisting and bending can be seen. Here wing is made of doubled paper to improve stiffness, but it wasn't helping in this case.As the last method was not very much helpful to resolve an issue, I tried to apply some reinforcement. And also made wing like typical airfoil (which was a curved plan in the previous case). In this case, the structure was enough stiff. But scaling it up seems a problem. I was considering wingspan of at least 60 cm. For this scale, stiffness was still not sufficient. As for stiffness problem increase with the increase in dimensions.So next approach I preferred was to make paper sticks skeleton and covering it with paper. In this case, plane covering and skeleton, both would provide strength to the structure.While making all this scale down the plane, my focus was on the method/approach that can sustain own shape instead of crash resistance.Learning from this exercise:Humidity or drying of glue creates lots of bending, which is not desirable.Having strong skeleton/structure is must (especially for bigger size plane).To make the skeleton, the triangle is (obviously!!!) best option. If the size of the triangle very small it cannot take enough bending load while keeping it higher would reduce its stiffness due to bending in-plane bending of paper surface.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FXQ/7V4K/JEUKMOTB/FXQ7V4KJEUKMOTB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8U/OW34/JEUKMOTC/F8UOW34JEUKMOTC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQV/K49R/JEUKMOT9/FQVK49RJEUKMOT9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUW/2QUA/JEUKMOT8/FUW2QUAJEUKMOT8.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Various Prototypes for Paper Planes"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "These airplanes are covered in one of my old instructable, so I will only cover it briefly in this step.I made two powered paper plane. out of first was failure and second was a flyable plane. These planes were powered by single cell 500 mah battery with Wltoys receiver. These WLtoys receivers are ideal for these type of project as it is just 6-8 grams of weight but contains 2 servo motor, brush ESC and obviously receiver. It has the total weight of 60 to 70 grams.I basically tried two planes:First was a conventional type plane having rudder elevator control. For stability, the high wing designed was chosen with the small value of dihedral. the major problem with this plane was that is had very low movement of control surfaces (due to smaller servo motor) which was not sufficient at all. So controlling plane is not easy. It survived multiple crashes but didn't fly well. But after this plane, I was confident about paper as RC plane material.For next plane a made a Flying wing type design. As these designs are not very stable in nature small actuation of the control surface enough. The wingspan of Flying wing was slightly higher than the Previous plane, but the weight was relatively lesser. This plane was flyable but still, it has some problem with control surfaces and power was slightly less. One reason for bad control was also bending of the control rod. as control rod has to travel from receiver to aileron that also has a 90 degree bend. so lots of loss of force occurs within the path.This module has low torque servo that is good enough for light duty application (here small RC plane). So it would have problems with controls. To overcome these limitations I took next project to use typical RC electronics like 2 servo motors, receiver, brushless ESC, and a BLDC motor.

In this plane, the battery has the good amount of mass (30 grams). so there is scope to enhance the design.So, I preferred to attach battery loosely, so in the case of the crash it just detaches from the plane and does not contribute to impact force. But the second thought that comes to mind that battery can also pull wire connected to it that can damage own wire, connectors or ESC wire. In the hard crash, the battery can even get lost (very bad). So I connected it to a rubber band that is connected to plane so basically plane would undergo two impacts instead of one big impact. here the first plane takes impact due to own weight (minus battery weight) that it would take impact due to the battery weight (if any).However, using this method can be bad for battery in case of nose dive type crash (which is anyways bad if you have assembled battery in the nose of plane).Leading edge wire:when plane collide with any stationary object while flying at low altitude it mostly damages the wing.

This value doesn't change with scale which means a full scale plane and model version of the same plane should have the same CWL if they want have the same flight characteristics.\u00a0 To find this, it gets a bit tricky. Use the equation below to help. WCL equals the weight of your plane divided by the wing area multiplied by the square root of the wing area. Similar aircraft have a range of WCL which dictates their flight abilities. Here is a short list of those values; 0-4 oz/ft^3 = Gliders 4-7 oz/ft^3 = Trainers 7-13 oz/ft^3 = Sport/Aerobatic 13+ oz/ft^3 = Racing Depending on what type of plane you are designing, pick a value to use it to find the weight of your plane in oz.\u00a0 This will give you a goal for what your plane should weigh before you take off!\u00a0 By this I mean the All Up Weight (AUW) with batteries or fuel installed.

Here are two great ratios to consider in the design of your airplane. These are the mentioned ratio of Power-to-Weight (P/W) and Thrust-to-Weight (T/W).\u00a0 There is a general range of P/W that dictates performance. It is listed below; 25 W/lb = Minimum for level flight 50 W/lb = Trainer or Casual flight 75 W/lb = Sport/Aerobatic flight 100 W/lb = Aggressive Aerobatic flight 150 W/lb = 3D Aerobatic flight 200 W/lb = Unlimited high-speed vertical flight Use the specifications of your motor to find the Wattage (Power) of your system and use that to determine the P/W. For example a certain motor I use has a rated power of 150W when running on 3S Lipos.\u00a0 I take that 150W and divide that by the airplane's AUW. Now we come to the final measure.\u00a0 Whew, so much work but only a little left until you get to go building! Or redesigning if your design fell short. But once you get all other measures confirmed, to help choose a prop or power system, the Static Trust-to-Weight ratio is suggested to be around .50.\u00a0 This will help ensure you have enough power to power around the sky and not fall like a brick.

If the ceiling area thatyou have to accommodate your bicycle is expansive and you are locating thebicycle nowhere near a wall or A/C ducting, then you can omit measurement \u2018C\u2019. Measurement\u2018B\u2019 needs to be more than 16 inches. In this way, the bottom of the wheels willbe touching the adjacent beam. This lends some stability to the bicycle hangingfrom the ceiling. Measurement \u2018A\u2019 needs to be less than 16 inches. Notice thatI indicate that the measurement should come from under the neck of the handlebars. The reasoning is that if the seat is in the way of a beam, you can easilymove the seat up or down to accommodate the beam. Certainly you can loosen thehandle bars and adjust them too, but who wants to do that. However, if thelocation of the handle bars is really giving you grief, or if you have a 1960\u2019sstyle vintage polo bike with butterfly handle bars, you can loosen the neckbolt and turn the handle bars 90 degrees.

I bought a road bike from a bike swap for $600 a couple years ago, but it wasn't great for triathlons and I recently got a dent in the top tube that worried me.  Luckily, as a part of my engineering curriculum I learned what I needed to build my own frame out of locally sourced black walnut wood.  While this was a fairly intensive 5-month project (I only had time to work on it occasionally because of school), I'll do my best to give a good outline of the steps involved.

The great part about a wood bicycle is that you can cater the bike frame exactly to your fit and your needs.  I used solidworks as a design platform to draw and model my frame.  I essentially started with the geometry of my road bike, because I knew that it fit me, and then adjusted it to have the triathlon qualities I was looking for.  Notable adjustments I made were increasing the seat tube angle, adding an airfoil shape to the down-tube and seat-post, lowering my seat-stay attachment, and adding a profile for the back wheel.  It is important during this step to keep in mind the components that you will be using for the build.  The wheels, seat post, steerer, and bottom bracket insert are all sizes that are especially important to get right.  The computer model should have the ares of the tubes that will be hollowed out to save weight.  I left about 6mm walls in all of the tubes.Finally, you should get the outline for the main triangle printed on a 1:1 scale.  I was able to get an engineering-printing company to print me two copies for about $5. The bike will be made by laminating thin plies of the wood together.  By doing this, you can take advantage of grain direction in key parts of the bike to improve strength in multiple directions.  My bike is made up of 8 layers of plies.  Because it is symmetrical, I made 4 plans of ply orientations that would be mirrored across the center of the bike.  Above is a picture of how I planned these layers on solidworks for another bike I made. For the head tube (which encounters a lot of stress) I made sure to include + and - 45 degree angles from the steerer axis for 4 of the layers and longitudinal with respect to the top tube and down tube for the other 4 layers.  For the joints of the down-tube/seat-tube and top-tube/seat-tube, I made sure that the plies coming in overlapped every other ply so that the joints would be well integrated.

Essentially I picked parts from my walnut boards that didn't have a lot of knots and assigned them, piece by piece, areas on the bicycle frame.  Then I used the table saw to cut them roughly to size at about a 10mm thickness (pictured above), planed them down to 6mm thickness, and used a miter-saw to cut the angles I needed for them to fit into my layout. I used the paper copies of my design and the 3/4\" plywood to make templates for my bike frame.  One of the printouts became the outside profile and one of them became the inside profile (for routing out the hollow portions).  I used the outside profile template to begin laminating the layers of plies together.  At my school's woodshop we built a vacuum table for this specific purpose, but you could use a vacuum bag and two boards to do it on too.  Essentially just laminate the two halves of the bike together one layer at a time so that you end up with 2 four-layered blocks of wood with all of the grain going in the directions that you designed.

Thinking of the points like they are on an xy plane all you have to do is take the horizontal and vertical distances from the plans, measure and transfer them to the plywood. Then when each point is plotted drive a brad nail into each dot.\nNow all you have to do is connect the dots. Obviously we can't use straight lines, so we will use a batten. Which is a long, thin, straight, and flexible piece of wood. Mine was about 3/8\" x 3/4\" x 150\". Take the batten and place it against the outside of the nails. My batten was flexible enough that I was able to attach it to the brad nails with clothes pins. At this point the curve of the batten represents the shape of the panel. Use the batten as an edge to draw the curved line from one nail to the next.

I considered using either a 1x6 or using a 1x3 \u2013 let\u2019s see using ForceEffect how each would differ.\nTo start, some basic assumptions need to be made. In cross section, a 1x6 has dimensions .75\u201d by 5.5,\u201d while a 1x3 has dimensions .75\u201d by 2.5\u201d. The weights of both are negligible compared to mine. I intended to counterbore the wood to prevent the bolts from sticking out, around 1/4\u201d. Lastly, since my fingers would go across the entire top, I assumed there was a 160 lb weight across the top of the board.\nFor the simulation, I assumed there are three points of contact, the two bolts and the bottom of the board. The top bolt will be represented by a ground, since it will be under tension and shear, while the bottom bolt will be represented with a sliding joint, since it can only have a shear force. The bottom point of contact will also be a sliding joint, since it can supply a force normal to the wall, but not lateral.\nThe first image is the simulation using ForceEffect for the 1x3.\nFrom this we can see that the top bolt will hold a majority of the weight, with most of the force in shear, rather than tension. Looking at the components of the top force vector, there will only be 5.9 lbs of force in tension. At the base of the board, there will be 8.3 lbs of force directly against the wall.\nNow, compare this to the simulation for a 1x6, shown in the second image.\nHere, the numbers differ only subtly from the 1x3 case. Now, the top bolt holds slightly more weight than before, and the bottom point of contact applies a slightly smaller force on the wall.\nIn addition, due to the amount of flexing the wood will experience, the bottom force will be even less than predicted in the simulation. The longer 1x6 will experience more flexing than the 1x3, so the bottom force will be minimal. As a result, it makes more sense to use the 1x6 over the 1x3.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FRN/A89Z/H4AGJOSF/FRNA89ZH4AGJOSF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7F/8U28/H4AGJOSG/F7F8U28H4AGJOSG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Simulation"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Here is the final product I came up with.

AND to make it interesting... we have a passenger... the Eggstronaut, which is an egg that if survives will award extra marks to the team.\nYou'll need the basic materials listed below as well as a launcher... Here's a link to a commercial version... i've added a couple of pics of it below as well.\nhttp://shop.pitsco.com/store/detail.aspx?ID=1179&bhcp=1\nI will design and build a launcher and do an instructable in a few weeks when I get a chance. I have seen all sorts of designs but I'm hoping to come up with something as effective as the commercial one above....\nA good hand pump works well but a compressor REALLY makes life easy... you can max the pressure like crazy, too.Learning Objectives:\n-The students will learn and apply Newtons Second Law of Motion in a way that makes sense to them...\n\"The more massive an object is... the more force it takes to accelerate it\" or you could say...\n\"Heavy stuff takes more force to move\"\n-The students will learn and apply the basic principles of\u00a0 Newtons Third Law of Motion...\n\"To every action there is an equal and opposite reaction\" or you could say...\n\"if you push something it will push back\"\n-The students will understand Newtons First Law of Motion...\n\"F=MA\" or to make it so I can understand...\n\"stuff\u00a0 that is sitting there will stay that way unless something happens to it. Once things start moving they tend to keep moving until something happens to change how it is moving\"\n-Students will learn to tell the difference between MASS and SIZE\n-By building a simple Rocket the students will understand these laws in a way that makes sense to them AND they will learn to think creatively, design and problem solve while building a basic design.\n-The students will learn to use basic tools to construct a working project.Tools and Materials:\n-scissors\n-Hot glue gun\n-duct tape\n-X-Acto or Olfa mat knife\n-2 liter pop bottles (NOT water bottles!) get at least 2 of them\n-Cardboard or coroplast (the stuff cheap signs are made of)\n-batting, foam, paper strips.... whatever you find for the Eggstronaut...\n-eggVocabulary:\n-Pressurizing\n-Ratio\n-Symmetrical\n-Hypotenuse\n-Scale (as in drawing to scale)\nI'll also provide a marking sheet at the end so you can use it in your class.\nRight, then. Lets get started...", "title": "A Rocket Eggstronaut Project", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/A-Rocket-Eggstronaut-Project/", "section": "outside", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Tools and Materials:\n-a couple of 2 liter bottles\n-Big sheets of paper. (i cut stuff off a roll from the art guys...)\n-Metersticks (yardsticks for the people south of me )\u00a0\u00a0 :-)\n-Lots of pencils.\n-An egg\n-a computer with examples of water-bottle rockets from the web. check out youtube... I use\u00a0 a TV attached to my ancient computer... not impressive but works fine...\nAfter you show the kids examples from the web they will be hard to hold back. Its pretty cool. I start asking questions like these:\n-How does it fly?\n-Why are some short and some long?\n-Some rockets have 2 fins, some 6... why?\n-What about the fin size?\nI cover each of these points on the board. What you want to coax out of them is:\nThe rockets fly by pressurizing air with water. (more on the water next day) This is important because the \"Booster Bottle\" which is pressurized ****MUST**** be a bottle for carbonated drinks and MUST MUST NOT be punctured or cut AT ALL. It will explode if otherwise. I've done it and it is really scary. \u00a0 \u00a0 Funny but scary.\nLong rockets (double length) work best. You can chat about what RATIO is now... Suggest methods of lengthening the rocket. (tubes, extra bottles)\nFins that are Symmetrical with 2-4 are best. Keep them small... explain that the rockets explode off at more than 100kph and large fins will rip off. A good size is a triangle with Hypotenuse of 3-7 inches and bottom edge of 1-3 inches is good.\nNow introduce the EGGSTRONAUT. Explain that if the passenger survives they will get extra marks. They love this. Go over padding and protection if you want but i find the kids come up with the most amazing ideas... better than mine! My only stipulation is that they have to make an escape hatch that can be used to insert and remove the Eggstronaut on the field.\nOnce the kids are ready i break them into groups of 2 or 3. Don't do 4... you always get at least one kid who is left in the cold. I pull out the paper and teach them about drawing objects to scale on the paper. You can trace out a bottle or two which helps them visualize it.\nSpend the remaining time working on design. You'll get a couple groups that finish the drawing in minutes... just send them back with revisions... measurements... notes... whatever you can make up :-) Make sure they draw the fins to size and they are being realistic about the egg and how it will get into the hatch.\nSpend some time discussing materials. I ask the kids to bring bottles, long cardboard tubes, cardboard, coroplast and any packing material they will need. Its up to you. I supply basic tools and tape to build the rocket with.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FU1/747A/H11WJCOA/FU1747AH11WJCOA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLH/8197/H11WJCOC/FLH8197H11WJCOC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM3/KBPP/H0OJ0V5C/FM3KBPPH0OJ0V5C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ5/0GHA/H0OJ763Q/FQ50GHAH0OJ763Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2Z/K70N/H0OJ7617/F2ZK70NH0OJ7617.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIY/PROH/H11WJCOL/FIYPROHH11WJCOL.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Day 1. the Introduction"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Tools and Materials:\n-Duct Tape\n-Hot glue and Hot Glue guns (not required...see below)\n-2 Liter bottles\n-Cardboard, Coroplast\n-scissors, x-actos, mat knifes...etc\n-Material for batting\n-2 skateboards (if you can find them...)\nThe kids are ready to build but first you can do a fun demo. The first law i teach about is Newtons 2nd Law...\"The more massive an object is... the more force it takes to accelerate it\" or you could say...\n\"Heavy stuff takes more force to move\"\nI like to demonstrate this by pulling up the smallest kid in the class. I pull out 2 skateboards.. facing each other and about 2 feet apart. I put the student on one skateboard and i stand on the other. I'm not a big guy but usually the size discrepancy is pretty obvious. I longboard as a hobby but i act like I've never stood on one. the kids like that... I ask the student to hold out both hands in front than i do the same. I ask the class what would happen if we pushed our hands together really hard. Of course the kids know what happens so i gently push on the hands of the student. Its amazing how far a kid will roll. I won't move more than a couple of inches.\nI get the kids to notice 2 things.\n-The person with less mass moved further\n-The person with more mass actually DID move a bit.\nNewtons 2nd law\u00a0 relates to the idea that more massive objects will take more energy to accelerate, or move. The person with less mass moved more because it takes less energy to move them.\nThe other part of the demo is that the more massive person still moved... This is explained by Newtons 3rd law which says:\"To every action there is an equal and opposite reaction\" or you could say...\n\"if you push something it will push back\"\nThe kids notice that i move as well. You could explain the idea that every time objects move each other BOTH have the same force being pushed on them. More massive objects don't MOVE as much but they still have the same energy exerted on them. This is also a good explanation for why we add water to the bottle. The water being pushed out from the bottle has more mass than just air so it pushes against the bottle harder which forces the bottle up with more force. You can tie this into Newtons 2nd law as well if the kids are still engaged at this point.Now you can start BUILDING STUFF\nPull out the drawings, gather the materials and demonstrate a couple of skills...-Stacking bottles for height.\nShow how to cut a bottle safely with a blade. keep the cap on when starting... makes it easier. I cut\u00a0 a bottle open about 4 inches up from the bottom than show how they can stack. Its up to you if you want the kids to use blades. It worries me so i ask the kids to use scissors AFTER i start the cut for them.-Taping\nI give out a meter at a time. Kids will use a whole roll if left to it. I demonstrate how much tougher and more accurate it is to use 4\" strips of tape placed lengthwise. i do one side, line up for symmetry than tape the other.-Using drawings as patterns\nI ask the kids to use the drawings as a pattern to cut out the fins and other parts... I find a scroll saw works great on cardboard and coroplast.\n\u00a0-Attaching stuff to the bottles\nUse sandpaper to scuff up wherever they want to attach things. Hot glue works well but i find that it is used WAY too much and kids burn themselves. I find tape works well. The fins can also be taped on with care.\nRemind the kids about a couple of things...They forget that the egg has to go in and out easily. I cut a hatch in the top bottle. Remind the students that they MUST NOT puncture the BOOSTER BOTTLE at all. Usually one team will forget this. You will also get at least one team that will forget that the booster bottle goes TOP DOWN and they will tape the fins on upside down. Make sure they understand SYMMETRY and that the rockets work really well if they are about 2 times the length of a bottle.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FAY/JOMG/H130PB9X/FAYJOMGH130PB9X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHZ/LQWU/H0OJ3RKA/FHZLQWUH0OJ3RKA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSB/UOF9/H0OJ0V8F/FSBUOF9H0OJ0V8F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC3/TDR2/H12SVDWK/FC3TDR2H12SVDWK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRM/UJ7N/H1AH6TNZ/FRMUJ7NH1AH6TNZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0W/9XLQ/H1AH6FL2/F0W9XLQH1AH6FL2.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Day 2...

I verbally test the class to make sure they remember Newtons #1and 2 Laws than i introduce the 1st law, which goes like this...\"F=MA\" or to make it so I can understand...\n\"stuff\u00a0 that is sitting there will stay that way unless something happens to it. Once things start moving they tend to keep moving until something happens to change how it is moving\"\nI ask What would happen to the student with less mass if NOTHING was slowing them down. The students usually know that the kid would keep moving... We talk a bit about why the student stops... friction, mainly...\nNow I ask them if both the small kid and myself started moving at the same speed who would go farther. They know intuitively that I would... but why? This is where the \"M\" in the 1st law comes in. Explain that FORCE (\"F\") would increase if the MASS (\"M\") increased... Show them simple examples on the board.\nSo how does this relate to the rockets? I explain that a slightly heavier rocket will go further. A WAY heavier rocket will not move at all of course. I suggest that weight in the nose can be beneficial BUT can be used ONLY if it is not sharp or too heavy or potentially dangerous. A ziplock of sand works really well. You can tell the kids this but they come up with great stuff on their own... One team used peanut butter which is heavy and also worked well as a protectant for the egg...\nI've included a series of shots that i use to demonstrate the process to the kids... The steps show how you can add two bottles together with just a bit of duct tape. You can also use the duct tape to attach some fins. Notice also that i added water to the top (non-booster bottle)\nI have kids work out plans for parachutes sometimes. They are pretty exciting for kids and sometimes work but need to be carefully planned.\u00a0 Most kids get a plastic bag, tape it to the nose and hope it will work. It won't. If you want to explore the idea of parachutes i suggest using plastic bags cut open and tethered properly. I've had students use a bottle cut in half with the egg attached to the top. The bottle rests on the booster rocket but is not attached. When the rocket is accelerating the egg bottle remains in place. When the rocket starts to slow the air pushes the bottle off and the parachute opens. I think i'll try it this time. If i do i will elaborate on it more and append this instructable.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FHW/96KG/H19RT2HC/FHW96KGH19RT2HC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPS/BM79/H19RHGRT/FPSBM79H19RHGRT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWL/XON6/H1AH6TO4/FWLXON6H1AH6TO4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJC/D651/H19RT2HY/FJCD651H19RT2HY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB4/L0AB/H1AH6FL9/FB4L0ABH1AH6FL9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRE/3C8M/H19RQURI/FRE3C8MH19RQURI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY8/2DMH/H1AH6FLA/FY82DMHH1AH6FLA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAJ/CA94/H1AH6TO7/FAJCA94H1AH6TO7.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Day 3 Building and Newton #1"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "I make sure the students understand the idea of adding water as it relates to the laws of motion. It seems that the ideal amount of water is about 1/3 of the bottle but encourage the kids to experiment.\nI bring out the Eggstronauts with much fanfare and excitement... its fun to turn it into a goofy event.\u00a0 The teams submit the rocket and eggstronaut hatch for entry. Once the water is added and the egg in place we launch. Make sure the kids are well back. sometimes the rockets go sideways. The most concern for safety comes when a team builds a really accurate rocket. This means the rocket is going to come down pretty much where everyone is standing. If this happens i get the kids to all make sure they have a back to the wall of the school... This really cuts down on the danger level. Do not let kids run after the rocket until it lands. They have a really solid punch... sometimes they leave holes in the ground.\nThe biggest concern for me has turned out to be the least. I was worried at first about the bottles exploding. After accidentally exploding a water bottle and a compromised pop bottle on two occasions I can tell you the only danger is the embarrassment of needing to clean your shorts afterward. It explodes with a very impressive gunshot that scared the heck out of me both times.\u00a0 My guess is that the material is so light it has very little momentum and doesn't cause damage other than evaporating whatever is attached to the bottle. Its pretty impressive!\nI give a basic mark related to the design... it needs to look like the rocket when finished. I also give marks for accurate flight and height and a bonus mark for eggstronaut survival.\nTry this project! I've done it for years and i have 20 year old ex-students come back and tell me they learned more with the rockets than half their science classes.

One way is to find a solid anchor point against which you can anchor yourself, such as a hole in the ground or sturdy log or boulder. It is important that your anchor point is smooth so you can be safely be dragged over it without injury.\rRemember that the amount of power generated by power kites in strong wind is scary and you can get seriously injured, so take it easy and learn gradually getting used to the kite and its power.\rWhat you do is brace yourself against your anchor point and bring your kite across the wind window at about 45 degrees above the ground. (This position changes with wind speed, in strong wind the kite needs to be more overhead.) As the kite nears the centre of the widow arch the kite upwards. As you feel the power increasing push backwards and upwards and you will be pulled vertically into the air. Ensure the kite flies directly overhead and you should land softly. If you jump too soon you will be pulled horizontally causing you to land hard and fast. The answer is to delay the jump until the kite is more overhead. With experience you will be able to judge the timing.\rThe other way to jump is to fly the kite horizontally across the wind window at about 50 degrees above the ground and at the same time run like mad in the same direction as the kite i.e. across the wind. You are trying to stop the kite from flying through the power zone and out the other side. When you feel the power starting to build turn the kite upwards and back the way its come. As you get lifted off the ground remember to turn the kite back again to its original flight path. \r(See image)\rThe trick to this type of jump is timing. A very similar maneuver is performed when kitesurfing so it is worth practicing as it will also give you a better feel of where and how a kite generates power and how to use this power to your best advantage.\rAll types of power kiting has the potential to be extremely dangerous so be careful and remember that things can go wrong really, really fast!\rDon't take chances and take your time learning the feel of the kite and your limitations.

First, I know this is not the first 2 Liter Bottle Water Rocket launching system ever designed.\u00a0 This design actually took inspiration from several of the designs that NASA had posted. http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/153405main_Rockets_Water_Rocket_Launcher.pdfhttp://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/Bottle_Rocket_Launcher.pdfhttp://www.nasa.gov/pdf/153406main_Rockets_Water_Rocket_Construction.pdf Second, depending on where you buy your parts and what stuff you have on hand, this may not be the cheapest design either.\u00a0 You will need to decide if this design provides you the characteristics that warrant the potential additional costs over alternative designs.\u00a0 I had some very distinctive goals with this Water Rocket Launcher system that I personally felt the other designs did not fulfill.\u00a0 For example:    The design needed to survive rapid repeated use in a very short amount of time.\u00a0 Scaling to 100+ repeated launches in a day with the ability to turn around and do it again the next day.\u00a0 Not only did this mean it needed to be rugged enough to last, but it had to have a system that allowed for quick resets.     The design needed to allow children 6-17 and adults of all ages to pressurize and launch the system from a safe distance (~20 feet). Although staging / clamping and safety check would be done by an experience adult / young adult prior to pressurizing, it was important to me that each participant had the opportunity to be involved in the act of pressuring and releasing the Water Rocket.  Third, I know the design is not perfect.\u00a0 I am hoping, like I did with other designs I found, someone will see this design, identify refinement opportunities, and be inspired to improve on it.Disclaimer:\u00a0 This \u201cInstructable\u201d is provided \u201cAs Is\u201d without any express or implied warranty of any kind including warranties of merchantability, noninfringement, or fitness for a particular purpose.\u00a0 The Author of this \u201cInstructable\u201d does not warrant or assume responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any information, text, graphics, links or other items contained within this \u201cInstructable\u201d post.\u00a0 In no event shall the Author of this \u201cInstructable\u201d be liable for any damages whatsoever (including, without limitation, lost profits, business interruption, lost information, damaged electronic equipment and circuits, damage to property) or be liable for any personal harm / pleasure / death whatsoever (including intentional or unintentional, without limitation, cuts, scratches, lacerations, punctures, bruises, inhalation, swallowing, or insertions) arising out of the use of or inability to use this \u201cInstructable\u201d, even if the Author of this \u201cInstructable\u201d has been advised of the possibility of such damages or personal risks.In short...

This Bottle Water Rocket Launcher Design has 3 major system components:    2 Liter Bottle Water Rocket & Pressurization Plug: This system stores the pressurized water and air and, on Launch Pad Clamp release, allows the 2 Liter Bottle to generate thrust projecting the 2 Liter Bottle housing into the air.     Launch Pad: Holds the 2 Liter Bottle Water Rocket while the system is being pressurized and provides a mechanism to quickly release the pressurized water / air.     Modified Bicycle Pump / Pressurization System: Although any bicycle pump can be used to pressurize the system, this modified version provided additional hose length and pressurized water back flow protection.\u00a0 Whether you use this modified bicycle pump or any off the shelf bicycle pump design, a bicycle pump or air compressor is required.

Price: Walmart has them for ~$10.00 - http://www.walmart.com/ip/24311975   Note: I choose the Bell Air Attack 300 Air Pump because it was inexpensive and easy to modify.\u00a0 Although I did not try other similar style bicycle pumps, it is my assumption that as long as the inner diameter of the pump hole is a 1/4 inch, another bicycle pump should work just fine.   Item: 1/4 inch PP Standard Check Valve - Quantity 1   Use: To prevent water from draining into the pump and extended pump hose line.     Price: U.S Plastics Corporate has them for $0.70 - http://www.usplastic.com/catalog/item.aspx?itemid=23369   Note: Normally the existing check value in the pump is sufficient to prevent pressurized water and air from leaking from the system; however, since I extended the hose length, I wanted to ensure pressure remained more consistent at the 2 Liter Bottle.   Item: 3/8 inch X 1/4 inch X 20 feet Clear Vinyl Tube (rated 55psi @ 70F /20C) - Quantity 1   Use: To extend the hose length of the bicycle pump.     Price: This is a pretty common item at any home improvement store.\u00a0 For a 20 foot length, it will be ~$5.00 - http://www.homedepot.com/p/202257573  Item: 3/4 inch Electrical Tape - Quantity ~3 inches   Use: To provide additional thickness at the end of the Clear Vinyl tube being inserted into the Bicycle Pump to ensure secure fitting when screwing down bicycle pump hose clamp.     Price: This is a pretty common item at any home improvement store.\u00a0 ~$1.00 per roll. - http://www.homedepot.com/p/100130843  Get your Tools...

I cannot emphasize enough that you need to keep your body parts away from this thing when it is being pressurized, alarmed, or launched.\u00a0 If you are using an unmodified bicycle pump with a short hose, get as far back as you can and make sure your head is not above the 2 Liter Bottle. If you find yourself in a situation where you inserted too little pressure and the Launch Pad Clamps have been released, just give the Bicycle Pump a couple more pumps; the added pressure should knock the Pressure Plug lose.\u00a0 Do not go over to the Launch Pad and tap the 2 Liter Bottle or Launch Pad Base; you risk knocking it lose and getting pegged with it. If you feel like pressure is escaping from between Pressure Plug and the 2 Liter Bottle when only moderate pressure exists, either the Launch Pad Clamp is not tight enough and/or the Pressure Plug is not insert far enough.\u00a0 Modified as needed to resolve. If you believe that you over drilled the Pressure Plug Housing in the Launch Pad Base and that is causing the Pressure Plug to not sit securely against the Launch Pad Base when Launch Pad Clamps are engaged, you can drop a washer or two into the Pressure Plug Housing underneath the Pressure Plug.\u00a0 Just make sure the washer is small enough to fit into the Pressure Plug Housing and the washer has a center hole large enough to allow the Schrader Value to slip through. If the Velcro strap holding the Launch Pad Clamp together does not release smoothly, double check that you have wrapped the Velcro strap over the top and underneath the Launch Pad Clamp arms allowing the pull of the Twisted Mason Line to back track the Velcro wrap smoothly. If the Launch Pad Clamp do not release quickly and smoothly, increase the hinge return spring tension.\u00a0 If you accidently lose the Hinge Tension Spring Pin, you can usually use a finishing nail as a suitable replacement. After initial repeated use, you may find that the through-hole in the Pressure Plug Housing for the Schrader Value may become too tight due to lumber swell from exposure to water.\u00a0 Using a 3/8 inch drill bit, just re-drill it out.

The skirt is mounted 25mm further in, but I mark this out when I have the top glued to the bottom just in case it\u2019s not central. The top deck is 900mm long and 350mm wide 9mm (3/8\u201d) plywood. The corners are cut off at 45 degrees 102.5mm in from the edge and 102.5mm down again this is to make the corners the same length as the front section so you only need to cut two different sizes of skirt sections. (Front/corners and sides)Starting with the bottom I added the 4 sections of ply to make up the battery box. I am going to be honest at this point and say I didn\u2019t take measurements just made it up as I went along. So all the dimensions are approximate (apart from the length, width and height) the battery box end is 100mm wide and the two sides are 200mm long. And the back section starts 100m from the end. All of these pieces of ply are 57mm high, this gives a total height from the top of the top deck to the underside of the bottom of 75mm which is important for the skirt shape. Next you can see in the pictures I have added the section of wood at the back which runs along the centre line of the board this bit was 100 mm long and doesn\u2019t have any holes cut in it. Then I added the two pieces at angles these do have holes in them, but I didn\u2019t measure the bits as I just cut them to size. Then add the 4 bits which run along the sides of the battery box all these bits have holes.I decided at this point to add a pointed front to the battery box so cut two pieces with angles on to meet at the front sections of the box.

Then add the remaining bits starting with the long bit which runs along the centre line of the board and as shown in the photo runs over the edge of the board by 50mm which was to help me line up the board top deck, this bit doesn\u2019t have holes in it.

The shape is based on 270 degrees of a 75mm radius circle (that is why it was important to cut all the middle bits 57mm height once you add the 9mm top and bottom decks you get 75mm). This is a fairly basic \u201cBAG\u201d skirt and because the corners are the same length as the front you only have to cut out two different length of fabric. The corners and front can be cut straight from the PDF template (with extra edges for sewing). I also use the template as a gluing guide. The template needs to be printed at 100% and on big paper, in the UK this is A3 size which is double the size of A4 (standard paper size). Check the dimensions on the plan once you have printed it.So to explain the process, I cut out the templates and draw around the template on top the fabric, I then mark out where the top and bottom lines are. These lines are where the skirt is joined to frames on the top and bottom of the board. I then cut out the fabric section about 10mm extra along the sides to allow for the sewing along the drawn lines. Once I have all the section I generally start with the front and back section and using a glue guide stick the sections together making sure you can still see the drawn line to allow accurate sewing along it. Once all the sections are glued together I then sew along the lines. Then I punched loads of holes 40mm from the bottom edge. These holes were 8mm in diameter and there are 3 in the front/corners and about 23 in the sides.The skirt is then mounted to the hull using pieces of 9mm ply you can use the PDF plan as a guide to cutting these pieces. The long sections that run down the sides should be cut to gap but if all has gone well these should be 550mm long. I mentioned at the start that the skirt isn\u2019t mounted at the edge of the underside, it needs to be mounted 15mm in from the edge. So with the hoverboard upside down use a square at the edge and measure in 75mm and 90mm, then draw the two lines and use these lines to mount the skirt on.

Unfortunately, people new to kiting sometimes get confused by the great variety of technical terms that can be used. This article provides kite flyers with simple definitions of the main terms used when flying kites that have just one line, and with generally-accepted names for the main kinds of kite.Parts of a KiteLine: the string you hold when the kite is in the air.Reel or Winder: The object that stores the flying line, similar in some ways to a fishing reel. They can be simple sticks with the flying line wrapped around, plastic handles with a pair of projecting forks to wrap the line around (the most common form), or winders that look a lot like a fishing reel. Whatever form they take, it is vital that you make sure that the end of the flying line is actually tied to the winder, or you will get to the end of your flying line and simply lose the kite to the wind.Sail: the fabric or paper that makes up the horizontal (or nearly-horizontal) parts of the kite. Sails provide lift.Leading Edge: The front edge of the kite sail, that hits the wind first.Trailing Edge: The back edge of the sail.Frame: poles, rods or sticks that hold the kite in shape. Parts of the frame have many different names, but the most common are spar (a rod that goes roughly side-to-side; longeron or spine (a rod that goes front-to-back); spreader (a rod that holds other rods apart); riser (small rod that lifts part of the kite out of the flat plane).Bridle: the loop or loops of string that join the line to the rest of the kite. On some soft kites, the bridle can look like the complex lines of a parachute. Simple bridles control the angle the kite flies at, complex bridles also hold the kite in a certain shape. Some kites do not have bridles at all.Tail: used to keep kites stable, pointing the right way, or just for decoration, tails are long, narrow and flexible.Drogue or Basket: bucket or bowl-shaped objects on the end of a line behind the kite, they are sometimes used instead of a tail as they do not need to be so long.Dihedral: a bend or curve in the kite that helps keep the kite stable.Keel: A vertical piece of sail material beneath the kite like the keel of a boat. Keels help keep the kite stable, and provide a place to attach the flying line without a bridle.Line Laundry: objects fastened to the flying line to look nice in the air.  They could be flags, extra tails, inflatable shapes or baskets.  Line laundry has no lift, and the kite itself is often just there to hold up the laundry.Things the Kite DoesPull: Simply, how hard the kite pulls against its anchor or the person holding it. Technically, pull is a combination of the upwards lift of the kite and the force down-wind due to the kite\u00c3\u0083???\u00c3\u0083??\u00c3\u0083?\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u0083??\u00c3\u0083?\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a2?\u00c3\u0083??\u00c3\u0083?\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00ac\u00c3\u0083??\u00c3\u0083?\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a2?\u00c3\u0083??\u00c3\u0083?\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a2s drag.Pitch: The motion a kite makes when its nose moves up or down. The pitch of a kite can change the way it flies. A kite with too much pitch will not lift as well as it might, a kite with too little pitch will stall and nose-dive out of the sky.Roll: A 'wiggle' along the length of the kite where the right or left sides move up and down. A slight roll will make a kite move to the side - that is how two-line kites work.Yaw: A twisting motion made by the flat kite, where the nose of the kite turns left or right.Put your hand flat on the table. Pretend it is a kite in the air. If you lift your fingers or the heel of your hand off the table, that is pitch. If you twist your hand flat on the table, that is yaw, and if you twist your wrist so that just your thumb or little finger lift off the table, that is roll.Wind WordsWind Shadow: The area behind an obstruction (such as trees or buildings) where the wind is not blowing. The wind shadow can be much longer than the height of the obstruction.Turbulence: 'Mixed up' wind, with flows in more than one direction (sometimes even down!).Beaufort Scale: A way of measuring wind speed.Kinds of KiteThere are only eight basic forms of kite, although there are many variations on these themes:Flat: Flat kites are just that, flat. The frame holds the sail completely flat, and often surrounds the edge of the sail. Popular flat kites are the three stick or barn door kite and the dragon or serpent, which incorporates a long tail as wide as the kite.Bowed: Bowed kites have frames that cross the kite, left to right and top to bottom, but do not surround the sail. The cross-wise parts of the frame are bent or curved upwards. The bend can be built into the frame, or held in using cords that pull the frame into a curve.Box or Cellular: Three-dimensional kites which often look like flying boxes. They are often made of a repeating shape or cell. The two most common shapes of cellular kite are rectangular boxes and tetrahedrons.Delta: An extremely popular and useful kite, triangular in shape (hence the name). Deltas have a single spreader, a spine down the middle, and rods long the leading (front) edges of the kite. They can fly in a wide range of winds, and lend themselves to a range of variations on the theme, such as seagull or swallow shapes. Most sport stunt kites are based on the delta form.Sled: Sled kites have little or no frame. Most kites (those mentioned above) have a dihedral that goes up at the sides, but sled kites are higher in the middle. The pressure of the wind holds the kite open, so no frame is required across the kite, and many do not have frames running up and down the kite. They can be folded up very small, so are often sold as 'Pocket Kites'. They are easy to make and fly and do not break if they crash, so they make good starter kites for children.Foil: Foils are similar to sleds, but lack any sort of frame. They are dual skin kites - air enters between the skins at the front of the kite and inflates the kite. Careful design means that the kite then takes on a shape and profile very similar to a wing. This generates a lot more lift than a usual single-skinned kite. Most foil kites have bridles with lots of 'legs', similar to the shroud lines of a parachute. Foils are also known as parafoils and flowforms, especially if they have been designed to resemble other objects. Famous flowforms include the giant kites of New Zealander Peter Lynn. He has produced trilobites, octopi and geckos the size of trucks and houses.Rotor: Rotor kites are rare. They do not gain lift from sails. Instead, they spin to gain lift. Typically, they will use the wind to make a horizontal rotor to spin (vaguely like the blade of an old manual lawnmower). This spin generates lift by a process known as the Magnus Effect. Some rotor kites have helicopter-style rotors and fly in the same way as a gyrocopter. Rotor kites fly better in high winds, but are often unstable.Compound: The constant effort to create new and interesting kites often results in compund kites, that share aspects of the other seven groups. Typically compound kites include winged boxes (a box kite with delta wings) and various combinations of sled and framed kite to make interesting shapes, such as the Stingray by Adrian Conn (a delta kite with a centre section made of a parafoil).Of course, it's not really as simple as that - there are kites with 2 lines, 4 lines or (rarely) 3 lines instead of just one, but they are still variations on the themes above.Stunt Kites: Kites that can be steered around the sky for entertainment purposes. The majority have two lines (pull the left line to turn left, the right to turn right), but some have four lines. The second two lines allow the kite to be stopped in the air, spun on the spot or even to be flown backwards.Power Kites: Stunt kites that are flown to experience the sheer power of the wind. Typically having two lines, they are usually foil-type kites that exploit wing-type aerodynamics to generate a lot of lift and/or drag.Traction Kites: Large foil-type kites that are usually designed to have more drag that lift. This means they can pull the user at great speed in a buggy, on a land-board (an off-road skateboard) or on a snowbaord. There is also a whole sub-set of traction kites designed for use by surfers. These kites usually have inflatable sections so that they can be recovered and launched from the water's surface, and have a distinctive tightly-curved arch profile. Traction kites always have four or three lines to allow for braking.Although surf kites are, technically, \"foil\" kites, they are different enough that some people class them as a separate, ninth form, the LEI (Leading Edge Inflatable).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTB/VQMX/KPTEXCFG43J/FTBVQMXKPTEXCFG43J.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Single-Line Kites: a Basic Glossary."}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Flying single-line kites is a peaceful hobby that requires little specialised equipment. A few extra pieces of equipment do make the hobby a lot easier, however.To Start With the Obvious:A kite.Some flying line.A handle or reel to wind the line onto.You would be surprised by how many people buy a kite and open the packet on the beach, only to find one of those three things missing.After that, things get a little more complicated, depending on the sort of kite you are flying. If you are flying a fairly small or simple single-line kite, usually all you need is somewhere to fasten your kite.Some Choices for Securing:Bits of the scenery, such as handy rocks or small bushes.Furniture, such as beach-shelters, deck chairs and the like.A bag of sand or gravel. This is quite convenient, since all you need to do is have a carrier bag in your pocket.A ground stake. This is a spike that you hammer or screw into the ground, with a loop at the top to fasten your kite onto. A good style looks like a corkscrew and can be bought from pet shops, intended to fasten dogs to.A carabiner (climber's \"crab\") is also useful, as it can quickly clip your kite to a handy object (beware, though, that cheap key-ring crabs are not strong enough for large kites). Never fasten a large kite to a pushchair, especially if it holds a small child! Of course, you could always be boring and hold the handle in your hand.If you are flying larger one-liners, or it is windy, gloves are essential. A taut kite-line can cut to the bone, and at least one person has got the line tangled around their ankle. Several people are killed every year by kites, mainly from line-related injuries. Ordinary gardening gloves are good, and cheap enough to leave in your kite bag. A good rule of thumb is to never pull or hold your line with a bare hand, just to avoid falling into bad habits.Spare tails are useful if wind conditions are variable, or if the tail of your kite is long and liable to get caught and torn. It is also useful to bring along something to wind your tails onto, such a pieces of heavy card, hardboard or thin plywood. This is particularly useful for the easy storage of dragon kites.Stuff to Have in Case of Emergency:It is useful to have an emergency repair kit, even for a kite you only paid 99p for.Scissors: pick a sharp pair, small enough to be convenient to carry, yet tough enough to cut through several thicknesses of line and sail material.Tape: Sticky tape is useful for fixing small cuts or tears, especially in plastic kites, but if a rip is large enough to need gaffa ('duck' or 'duct') tape, then it is large enough to warrant packing up and going home to fix it properly.Glue and paper: paper kites sometimes come unstuck at the seams, so a glue stick will help to attach a small patch. Rips in paper can get worse quickly, so gluing small patches over rips helps to greatly extend the life of a kite.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ7/W08W/EMAEXCFG487/FJ7W08WEMAEXCFG487.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Single Line Kites: Essential Equipment."}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Many people overlook the importance of tails when flying kites. They are not simply decorative extras, they also serve to keep the kite stable and pointing in the right direction. Professionally-made kites come with the correct tail, so this article will concentrate on tails for kites made by the occasional hobbyist.How Does a Tail Work?Some tails keep the kite the right way up by simply making the back of the kite heavier, but most tails use a combination of weight and drag or air resistance to provide stability, forcing the trailing edge of the kite to, well, trail.A Selection of Common Types of TailFor a large kite, it is worth considering buying a pre-made tube tail. These are simply long, narrow tubes of strong plastic. They can be purchased from most retailers with a good supply of kite materials, or from one of the many online kite retailers.A drogue is a small windsock, shaped rather like a bucket with the bottom cut out. The wider mouth of the drogue is held open by a loop of heavy cord or thin bamboo, and attached to the rear of the kite by a relatively long line. The exact length is a matter of experimentation, but may be between one and five metres long, depending on the exact size and design of the kite, the size of the drogue - small drogues need longer lines - and the wind conditions at the time.Decorative windsocks, typically purchased from sea-front stalls to mark your territory on the beach, can also be used as drogues.Plastic bags cut into strips make good, all-round tails. The strips can be taped end to end until the desired length is reached, which can be anything up to ten times the length of the kite and can easily be trimmed if they prove to be too long when the kite is actually flown. For wide kites and sled kites, tails like this can be looped and each end stuck to the kite, with one end of the tail at each end of the trailing edge so that they look like a letter 'U' when in flight. This has the advantage of requiring a shorter tail, as the bend provides extra drag, but the loop can catch on things if the kite flies low.Paired tails can be used to balance wide kites. If you attach a separate tail to each end of the trailing edge, they can be trimmed if the kite has trouble flying true. If the kite tends to drift to the left, trimming some of the tail from the left side of the kite can correct the fault.Ladder tails are made of two parallel lengths of line, with regular 'rungs' of paper or ribbon strung between them. They provide a great deal of drag so do not need to be very long, but can be difficult to balance correctly. Because they are rarely used, they make an interesting talking point for a home-made kite.The traditional image of a kite tail is a length of line with bows tied along its length. They do work, but invariably draw comments about Charlie Brown and kite-eating trees.A very visually-effective tail can be made using videotape. Retrieved from broken cassettes, the tape is very light and smooth, so it is best suited to small kites but can also be used in very long lengths, up to 20 times the length of the kite itself. The tape snakes and writhes in the air, but can get easily tangled and it is not biodegradable, so do not be tempted to leave it tangled around scenery after an accident. Abandoned videotape is a hazard to wildlife.Other less-than-traditional materials that make good tails are boundary tapes, as used by surveyors and the emergency services. Ribbons come in many colours, widths and lengths, so can be used for most kites.Micro-kites the size of your hand or smaller need even lighter tails, and great success has been had with lengths of ordinary knitting-wool because its rough surface provides plenty of drag, lengths of audiocassette tape or carefully-cut strips of tissue paper. The smallest micro-kites use single strands of silk, teased from lengths of embroidery thread.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FUM/EFBD/EA8EXCFG8HK/FUMEFBDEA8EXCFG8HK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Tails for Single-line Kites"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Kite-flying is a popular hobby that has been an art and a sport for over 2,000 years. For the vast majority of that time, the kites had only a single flying line. All through that time, the hardest part of flying a kite has been actually getting the thing in the air. Where to Fly a KiteThe first thing to do is select a suitable location, but please also check this article on kite safety. It is well-known that successful kite-flying needs a decent breeze, but it is less well-known that the breeze should be as smooth as possible. Select an area that is not only clear, but has clear approaches: if the wind has to come over a solid wall of buildings, trees, cliffs or hills then it will be turbulent, with gusts blowing down as well as along. Not good for kites.The High LaunchOnce you have selected a suitable area to launch, the easiest launch to try is known as the high launch, because the kite gains altitude quickly. The high launch usually needs an assistant (spouses or reliable offspring are often able to be 'persuaded' to take on this role). Stand with your back to the wind, and with your assistant holding the kite as far away as possible, holding the kite.The way the kite is held is important. The assistant must be behind the kite, holding each side of the kite with enough space between the kite and their body so that the kite does not snag on their clothes, head etc. The line between you and the kite must be slightly taut, but not taut enough to pull the kite out of your assistant's hands.An important point: you do not want to get your tail tangled. The ideal way to ensure this is to lay the tail along the ground back towards you as you are standing ready to launch. The tail can blow around quite a bit on the launch, which is why your assistant needs to stand with space between themselves and the kite.At a signal from you (usually a yell along the lines of \"now, I said now, yes, let go!\"), your assistant lets go and takes a step back and to one side. That's all. They do not throw the kite up. Throwing the kite makes it unstable and robs it of some of its vital lift. At the same time, you take a single step backwards (remember to read the safety instructions) and the kite will soar upwards. Once the kite is as high as it will go, you may pay out as much line as you wish.The Solo LaunchDedicated kite-flyers will eventually have trouble finding somebody to help them perform high launches, as wives and children eventually get bored waiting for you to get bored. This is the time to perfect the solo launch.Safety note: the solo launch requires you to hold the flying line directly, so wear tough gloves.Unwind three or four metres (ten to 12 feet) of flying line, and hold the kite by the line (hence the gloves) about one metre (three feet) from the kite, with the rest of the line in a loose loop across to the winder held in your other hand. Stand with your back to the wind and hold the kite out to the side, out of the wind shadow created by your body. As the wind catches and lifts your kite, let the line slide through your gloved fingers until the kite reaches the height allowed by the loop. You should now be able to fly your kite as normal, but look out for any sudden changes in the kite's flight, as even a level area has low-altitude turbulence. Try and get the kite to the desired height as quickly as possible, but remember to keep tension in the line or it will lose height instead of climbing.The Solo High LaunchSome cellular kites can be launched solo, but still with a high launch. This is particularly useful for tetrahedral kites. If your kite is sensitive to dirt or water (for instance, if it's made of paper), then you should make sure the ground is dry.Stand the kite on the ground, with the bridle facing into the wind. As you walk back towards the point where you intend to stand, unwind the flying line. You must keep the line slightly taut, or your kite will roll over in the wind and be impossible to launch, and make sure that it does not get snagged on anything lying on the ground. When you are ready, a steady pull on the flying line will tip the kite towards you until it reaches a flying angle and climbs skywards. You should be careful launching cellular kites in this way, as they can develop a lot of pull very quickly.Landing a Single-Lined KiteHowever you launch your kite, there are only really two ways to land it. The most usual way is to wind it down, winding the line around your reel until the kite is low enough to be simply plucked out of the air. If your kite is particularly powerful, or the wind is especially strong, simply winding the kite down can put excessive stress on the reel and the line, either crushing the winder itself, or keeping too much tension in the line whilst in storage. If this is the case, the kite can be 'walked' down.To walk a kite down, the winder needs to be anchored (either held by your trusted assistant, or fastened down with a ground stake). You then hook a walk-down device (see below) over the flying line and walk towards the kite. This will pull the kite down to ground level without putting any extra tension on the line or winder. When the kite is low enough to be plucked out of the air, the tension is lost from the flying line and it can be easily and safely wound up.Safety note: while walking the kite down, the line will be low enough for people to walk into, as well as thin enough and taut enough to do harm to anybody who does walk into it. You must keep a watch out for passers-by and shout a warning should they look as though they are going to walk into the line.The Walk-Down DeviceThe complexity of the walk-down device depends on how often you need to use it, how much you are willing to spend on it or how much effort you want to put into making it. The simplest form is a tent peg (the kind made of a bent piece of thick wire). You hook the short end over the line, hold the long end that usually goes in the ground, and walk towards the kite. More complex kinds use pulleys that go over the line (the rolling pulley wheel reduces wear-and-tear on the line) and have a handle on each side to make it easier to hold. At the very simplest level, you can simply use your hand if you are wearing gloves, sliding your open hand along the top of the flying line. You must never use this method without gloves. To do otherwise would be about as sensible as running your hand firmly along the serrated edge of a hacksaw blade. You have been warned.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FGT/T4ZS/PH7EXCFG8KY/FGTT4ZSPH7EXCFG8KY.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Launching and Landing a Single-lined Kite"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Stunt kiting is a great hobby. The two-lined kite can provide hours of fun once it is up in the air, but getting it off the ground can be a pain because you really need someone to hold the kite while you launch it. This person is then redundant for the rest of your kite-flying. This entry presents two ways of launching the kite single-handedly.The Beach LaunchThis launch method involves weighting down the trailing edge of the kite. It works well on sandy beaches but you can also use it in non-sandy areas by using small pebbles instead of sand as weights. It works in most winds but not if there are low-level obstructions (such as long grass or low dunes) to stop the wind at ground level. It is particularly useful for soft kites with no rigid frame or for kites like the Flexifoil Stacker 6, which only has a single spar (rod) across the leading edge. Stand with your back to the wind, holding the kite leading-edge up and with the side that faces the kite-flyer facing you. Kneel down and lay the kite on the ground (bridles facing up) in front of you. If your kite is triangular, the long edge (trailing edge) should now be nearest you.Pile sand or small pebbles along the trailing edge of the kite to hold it down. Don't use large or sharp stones, as these will damage the sail.Walk away from your kite into the wind, laying out your lines. It is vital that both lines are exactly the same length. Stand with your back to the wind, holding the handles at about chest height, with a light tension in the lines. Take a step back, pulling the kite slowly upright. The sand or pebbles ensure that the nose of the kite lifts first. As it lifts, the sand or pebbles spill off and the sail fills with air. As the kite tips just past the vertical, the sails will fill properly and the kite will rise into the air. Keep the tension equal on both lines until the kite is well clear of the ground, and then start your stunt routine. Launching Using StakesIf you don't have sand, or your kite has a rigid shape that does not allow its trailing edge to be weighted down, you may want to try using stakes.Hammer two stakes (sticks, poles, etc) into the ground, about one-third of your kite's width apart (so if it's a three-foot (90cm) kite, put the stakes one foot (30cm) apart). The stakes should be long enough so that they are slightly taller than the kite when it leans on them. Rest the kite against the stakes so that it is leaning backwards slightly and facing the wind. The pressure of the wind should keep it in place.As with the weighted launch, walk away, stand back and take a step back. The kite will tip towards you, and as it passes the vertical the forces holding it down will start to lift it upwards instead and your kite will launch.Be Safe!The stakes present a significant hazard - imagine tripping over one and landing on the other! Make sure they are blunt, maybe even topping them off with an old tennis ball. Also make sure the stakes are visible by tying strips of plastic bag or lengths of reflective tape to them. The flapping strips will not tangle your kite as they will blow behind it.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FY1/WT2B/UU9EXCFG8NR/FY1WT2BUU9EXCFG8NR.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: How to Launch a Two-Lined Kite by Yourself"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Of course, you will always fly your kites safely, but we all need reminding sometimes:If your kite is large, or your flying line is thin, wear gloves. Kite string can cause burns and deep cuts. It is best to avoid holding the flying line in bare hands at any time, this way safe handling of taut lines becomes a habit.Avoid loose loops of flying line hanging from the reel or winder. A sudden gust of wind can tighten them, causing tangles in the line or around things you would rather not get tangled (Fingers, feet or passing strangers). These loops can cause deep cuts that may well end up needing stitches.Never fly a kite in wet or stormy weather, or with wet lines, with a metal frame, or with a wire flying line. This is all like flying your own lightning conductor.Never fly near overhead cables, substations or antennae. If your kite does get caught up in power lines or goes behind the fence of a substation, leave it there. No kite is worth dying for.Never fly in public streets, crowded areas, or across roads.Always watch where you are going. Choose a flying area without trip hazards, and look where you are going if you are walking backwards. Never run backwards.Wear a brimmed hat, sunglasses and sunscreen. Remember, over-exposure to ultra-violet light can cause skin cancer and cataracts.If you are flying a power kite, switch the brimmed hat for a properly-fitted helmet and pads.If you are on wheels (a board or buggy), you may want to consider wearing impact armour as well.Remember the law: kites must not be flown more than 60 metres high, and you must not fly the kite where it can be a hazard to aircraft, such as near airports, gliding centres, or areas where others are hanggliding or paragliding.

You need to design a crash cushion that can stop the speeding cart slowly, so that it and it's hypothetical passenger experiences the least force during the crash. Lower forces mean that the passenger is more likely to avoid violent motions that result in serious injury. In creating your crash cushion you'll probably want to start from simple designs first, like boxes of soft materials or structures designed to catch the runaway cart. From there, you can improve your original designs or work up to more complex constructions. You may also want to look at real world devices for inspiration for your crash cushion, such as an airbag that gently deflates as the cart collides with it or heavily textured surface that slows the cart down through friction. In writing this instructable we came up with three different designs for a crash barrier: the Bubble Wrap Box, the Paper Cup Accordion, and the Craft Paper Net, as shown above respectively. Each design had its own flaws and benefits. The Bubble Wrap Box caught the cart easily, but did not give it a very soft landing. Although the Paper Cup Accordion stopped the cart nicely by slowly compressing, it was often hard to hit with the cart. The Craft Paper Net also caught the cart gently, but would then sometimes be too elastic, causing the cart to quickly rebound off of it. These are just a few ideas, as the possibilities for your crash cushions can be truly endless. We encourage to you try many different types of designs, even if they seem weird or impractical at first.

By keeping these parameters constant, you can take consistent measurements of the effectiveness of each crash cushion. If you mark a line near the top of your ramp, you will be able to know exactly where to release the cart so that each trial starts at the same height. Additionally, you must keep the distance between the bottom of the ramp and the cart's point of impact the same. When placing the crash cushion between the ramp and the crash barrier, you will need to move the ramp or the crash barrier back so that the distance between the bottom of the ramp and the front of the crash cushion is the same as the original distance between the bottom of the ramp and the crash barrier. In the photos above you can see that the distances from the ramp to the wall and from the ramp to the Paper Cup Accordion crash cushion are both about 20 centimeters.To start recording data about your cart crashes, first open the PocketLab app in whatever mobile or laptop device you are using and connect your PocketLab sensor. We recommend that you use the two graph setting with the Acceleration graph and Acceleration Scalar graph, which can be selected through the graph icon in the upper left-hand corner of the screen. The Acceleration Scalar graph will show you the net acceleration of the PocketLab sensor, while the Acceleration graph will show you the acceleration of the sensor in all three individual axes. The scalar acceleration will give you an overall picture of the acceleration, which is probably what a passenger in a car cares about most. The regular acceleration graph, however, will give you a more detailed description of the forces and accelerations acting on the cart.To collect data, hold your cart at the starting point on your ramp and press the record button in the PocketLab app. Once data start to appear onscreen, release your cart. Once the cart has crashed into the crash barrier or crash cushion and has stopped moving, press the stop button to stop recording data.

To run control trials, just have your cart crash straight into the crash barrier, without a cushion. This is so you can know how what the forces and accelerations look like without any kind of cushioning and so that you have values to compare your cushioned trials with. The first image above is a screenshot of a graph from our control trials, which shows a baseline value of about 4.30 g. The spikes in the graphs show points in time where the PocketLab sensor experiences a sharp change in acceleration, such as when the cart crashes. The spike showing the crash is usually the largest and found near the end of the timeline. The smaller spikes in acceleration found before it on the timeline are usually caused by bumps or jostling when the cart rolls off the ramp and onto the floor. In terms of decreasing injury in a car crash, the peak acceleration is probably what you want to be looking at.Once few control trials recorded, you can begin to run test trials for each of your crash cushions. Do the same thing that you did for the control trials, but place the crash cushion you've designed in front of the crash barrier first. Remember, another important scientific habit is making to sure to run multiple trials for whatever you're testing.

And if you're familiar with Newton's second law of motion, you know that the force an object exerts is equal to its mass times the rate at which it is accelerating (F = ma). Because force is directly related to acceleration, the force increases when the acceleration increases. And when the acceleration decreases, the force is also decreases. If we want the force maximum force acting on the cart to be low, then we must make the maximum acceleration is experiences also low. In our tests, you can see that the Craft Paper Net performed the best, producing the lowest acceleration of 1.56 g. By running many trials and comparing with control results, you can get a very precise idea of how effective each of your designs are. Once you have this information, you can go back to the drawing board and improve your designs to be even safer and more effective.

Hoping it will help others who are working on the same topics.Up till now I had my robots running towards a target, keeping it in sight and adjust the direction of the bot according to the change in the camera image. Simple and effective when one can use target objects to aim for. The scripts I used resulted in nice curved moves towards markers I placed upfront.But thinking about controlled moves without using a camera and running trajectories in a straight line at a certain speed for a certain distance, I had to dig in the theories of odometry: the use of data from motion sensors to estimate change in position over time.The idea is simple and as old as ancient navigation by sailors. The method they used is called \u2018Dead reckoning\u2019, where \u2018De(a)d\u2019 stands for \u2018deduced\u2019. The sailors estimated their position relative to a starting location by using velocity and heading. Once new data on the real position was retrieved (e.g. by sextant measuring), a new, corrected, estimation was made. To become effective rapid and accurate data collection, equipment calibration, and processing are required in most cases.So, to make a robot car move in a straight line for a certain distance at a certain speed, one should estimate where it will be in a short moment of time, then read the actuators, determine corrections based on the errors between estimation and readings and calculate a new estimation. Sounds like a typical job for a computer!But there\u2019s a lot more involved than bare coding. The hardware characteristics are important (size of the car and the wheels, strength of the motors, maximum velocity and acceleration of the bot and the resolution of the actuators). And then there\u2019s still a lot more that influences the effectiveness, leading to (sometimes) frustrating results. But I\u2019ll come to all that later on.I\u2019ll deal with the estimation part, the control loops (explain the use of PID\u2019s), characteristics of the actuators and some handy parts of theories about dead reckoning with robots.The Python script can be found at:Running squaresYou won\u2019t find very sophisticated coding there. It is written straight forward with a lot of comments to make it as readable as possible for those who are just starting (like me).The same applies to the movie. It\u2019s not a commercial video. Shot with my Blackberry smart phone and just meant for illustration of what the script implies.", "title": "  Odometry: Running Squares", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/RB2-running-squares/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "To build the script 3 main parts have to be considered: the \u2018Steering\u2019 part, which can be derived from the hardware characteristics, the \u2018Controlled\u2019 part, the algorithms dealing with the differences (errors) between the estimations and reality and the \u2018Actual\u2019 part, consisting of the data from the sensors (actuators) used, providing information about the most probable (!) actual situation. The effectiveness of the script heavily depends on the accuracy of the actuators used. For example: if the ancient sailors would have had a GPS system, they would have had more accurate data on their actual position.  Using more, different, actuators like encoders, a digital compass, a GPS retriever (for outside use) or even a gyroscope, would produce more accuracy on the actual situation. Unfortunately it makes the controlled part a bit more complex, for it should deal with the weighted influence of the separate sensors to determine the most accurate data on the actual position ('sensor fusion'). Every actuator used, will at least bring some particular \u2018noise\u2019 into the equations. If a GPS receiver would be retrieving data at a steady position for, let\u2019s say, 24 hours, the plotting of that data would be scattered around the actual position. Therefor the accuracy of a GPS system is expressed by 95% of the readings falling within a certain range (e.g. < 5 meter). To deal with filtering sensor noise and balancing the weight between the separate actuators one should use a more sophisticated control loop. The Kalman filter is often used for that.So to keep it simple in my first explorations, I stuck to a single actuator and only used encoders. They generate \u2018ticks\u2019 per rotation of the wheel axes, thus providing data on the actual turning of the wheels (which actually provides info on velocity and/or distance).There are many different encoders. Optical encoders often use a segmented disc to measure the changes (from solid to non-solid and reverse) with an infrared sensor. The resolution (i.e. amount of ticks per revolution of the wheel axis) of optical encoders is rather low and thus limits the accuracy that can be achieved. Other encoders make use of magnetic discs and do have a much better resolution. Optical encoders are much cheaper and easy to tune/use. Finally encoders can be single or quadrature. The latter also provides data on the direction of the wheel rotations.RB2 has single optical encoders. They do oppose limitations; especially on the accuracy (>= centimeters) and the measuring frequency (we need at least 1 tick to enter the controlled part).Now let\u2019s dive into the \u2018Steering\u2019 part. It is the most factual part and all variables needed can be calculated upfront and used as constants in the script. If the script is intended to be used on several different robots, the \u2018Steering\u2019 part has to be dealt with in the initialization routine of the script. Some facts about RB2:The chassis is a DF Robot Baron (4 motors, connected as 2 differential motors) + additional mounting floor Optical encoders on the 2 front wheels, generating 20 ticks per revolution. The distance between the center of the wheels   = 0.147 m.  The wheel diameter  = 0.065 m. These facts can be used to calculate some important data:The wheel perimeter =  0.20  m (i.e. Pi * the wheel diameter) The amount of ticks per meter  = 97.9 t/m (i.e. ticks_per_revolution / wheel _perimeter) The full_turn_perimeter     = 0.46 m   (i.e. wheel_center_distance * Pi)  When using both sides in counter revolution!! I\u2019ll come to that later when diving into turning by a certain amount of degrees The amount of ticks_per_full_turn     = 45.2 t   (i.e. full_turn_perimeter * ticks_per_meter) The amount of ticks_per_degree   = 0.13 t   (ticks_per_full_turn / 360)So we already have a lot of useful data, but we also need some figures depending on the velocity. We need to know the maximum speed the robot could reach. Sometimes the supplier provides data on the kit and/or motors, but that turned out to be far off. I made some calculations on the maximum rotation on the motors, taking the deduction ratio of the gearing into account, but that also proved to be far off. For a lot of obvious (and less obvious) reasons: slight manufacturing differences (even when acquired from the same series), gearing resistance (lubrication), tiny wheel differences (center position, diameter), the grip of the tires, the weigth of the car and how it\u2019s distributed and a lot of environmental influences like: the surface (resistance, unevenness, flatness) and even air resistance. All factors that cannot be dealt with in the control model and why some probable data has to be acquired by testing upfront (while keeping as much factors as constant as possible). The maximum speed of the robot can best be found by running it in the same environment at maximum PWM for a certain time and measure the distance made in the middle of this run. I think this could be best measured by counting the encoder ticks and recalculate these into meters (doing so will at least take the encoder noise into account). RB2 came out with 0.31 m/s (the supplier provided 0.68 m/s). With this figure we can calculate an other variable needed:The max_ticks_per_second = 30.4 t/s (i.e. ticks_per_meter * max_speed) At last we need the stall speed. This can also be found by testing: start with 0.0 PWM and increase the PWM until the robot really starts to move. It is common to be 5 \u2013 30% of your total PWM scope. For RB2, I came out with: 0.124   m/s.Now we have all the data to estimate the velocity and distance made by the robot to cross a certain distance at a certain speed. The figure below shows the typical diagram for such a run.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8C/0NKK/IC37DJ9D/F8C0NKKIC37DJ9D.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: The Steering Part"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The steering part provides the facts for our calculations. The next step is the estimation of where the robot should be as a start of the controlled part of the script.First of all we\u2019ll have to pick an interval for the control loop including the sensor measurements. The smaller the interval, the better: creating a fast feedback on our estimations by the data of the encoders. Preferably the interval should be around 0.01 second. The Dagu Arduino like mini driver of RB2 allows a feedback interval for the sensors of 0.01 sec. But there were some things to consider. At first there are several sources of delay (e.g. the execution time for the control loop itself). Second to take into account is the encoder resolution. In other words: the minimum time required to generate at least 1 tick at starting speed (i.e. the stall speed). For RB2 0.1 sec is used as interval. A 10-times lower feedback frequency does have its implications on the control loop: it limits the degree of tuning the errors and adjustments. A trajectory of 2 meters will take a good 6 seconds to finish (0.31 m/s). In this period there will only be less than 60 moments to read the actuator data and implement the calculated adjustments. For good tuning (I will come to that when describing the control loop) one should at least have a couple of hundred evaluation loops. You can watch the effect in the video at the start of the blog: the corrections on the direction are sometimes a bit abrupt. Having a higher feedback frequency will allow to smooth-en the corrections more. (Another cause is the encoder resolution: the minimum error that can be read is 1 tick. So what you see on the video, is the best I could squeeze out of the situation.)It is essential that the evaluations are done at a constant frequency. Variations in the intervals are disastrous for the control loop! That\u2019s where I was confronted with another hurdle. I started using the Python time.time() function, but found out it created some weird peaks. Even when just running a script with only the interval loop itself. So I switched to the time.clock() function which is bound to the processor time itself and ran the script on a Windows, a Unix and a Linux system. Halas with no better results. Even tried threading.Timer() to generate a timing loop as a separate thread. This worked out fine, but made the script far too complicated (for me). As you can read in the script, I ended up with capping the timer at a maximum and skip the control loops when the timer exceeds the limit. A bit rough and it does have its consequences on accuracy, but it works better than having too much variances in the control loops.  Probably one could produce a better timing/event handling in C/C++, but for me that would take me too much time to find out in the light of what the script should do.So at every 0.1 sec the encoders are read, the differences (errors) on our estimation are calculated and a new estimation is made. In the script the desired velocity of the bot is calculated and set as target. Targets are more often referred to as \u2018Setpoints\u2019. In the script a Setpoint is the desired speed multiplied by the interval time, giving the amount of ticks to make in the interval. Actually this isn\u2019t correct. The desired speed is the speed at the end of the interval. If one wants to work more precise, one should use the equation:   Vt = Vo + a.t or at least the average speed: (Vt \u2013 Vo) / t to calculate the exact amount of ticks that should be made in the interval. (V stands for Velocity in m/s, a = the acceleration and t = the interval time). Taking in account all limitations I described already, I kept it simple. As the video shows, one can reach reasonable results anyhow.Having a setpoint established, the bot will run at a certain speed and at the start of a new interval, the setpoint can be evaluated against the encoder data. That\u2019s where the controlled part starts. ", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FN0/QEHV/IC37DJLZ/FN0QEHVIC37DJLZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: The Control Loop"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Let\u2019s imagine the first setpoint = 2 ticks. So we expect the bot to run at 2 ticks per 0.1 sec. (Like I mentioned: this is a rough calculation, leaving out acceleration during the interval). Then the bot starts to run at stall speed. After 0.1 second the sensors are read and the encoders come up with 1 tick. We\u2019 re below target at an error of 1 tick. In formula:error = setpoint \u2013 actual ticksThe actual speed has to be increased for we are aiming at a higher speed for the bot to run. The simplest way to correct that is adding the error to the next speed command.  In practice this will turn out to be too much or too less to get the bot near the desired speed. Tuning of the correction can be done by multiplying the error with a constant. This way of correcting is called \u2018proportional\u2019. The tuning constant is called a \u2018gain\u2019. In formula:P = Kp * errorTuning the proportional correction thoroughly will reduce the error over time significantly, but will never bring it to zero (for there\u2019s always an error needed for a proportional correction). In a lot of cases this way of correcting the error will also result in rapid changes, resulting in a shocking behavior (oscillation) of the bot. To smoothen the reactions an \u2018Integrated\u2019 part is added to the correction by summing up the errors over time. The integrated part also can be tuned by using a gain. In formula:I = Ki * sum of errors * intervalSumming up will finally reduce the error to zero and it works fine as long as there is a portion of the error left. Integrating will also prevent endless increasing of the speed. The correction takes more time and \u2026 works longer. So when the error is finally reduced to zero, the integrated part of the correction will keep on working (and become negative) until the sum of all errors is reduced to zero. This is called overshooting.Often (e.g. when applied on a balancing robot) a third part of the correction is needed to \u2018mute\u2019 the overshoot. This is the \u2018differential\u2019 part. It deals with the volatility of the change by taking the difference between 2 errors over time into account. Also the differential part can be tuned by using a gain. In formula:D = Kd * (error \u2013 previous error) / intervalAdding the parts will result in a controlled correction of the speed: P + I + D.  The setpoint, the error and the PID-correction are all set in ticks (per second). For the command to change the motor speed, it is needed to recalculate this into a PWM-percentage. Every time the controlled part is executed, the speed of the motors will be increased until the bot runs at the desired speed.As mentioned before: this is a simplified control and works without using the acceleration in the equations. Looking at the velocity diagram: this script doesn\u2019t realize a decelerating motion. When entering contests you will need to and you probably will have the bot crawling for the last millimeters towards the exact target distance. (Working with RB2 is done in centimeters at the best.)The full Python coding is provided in the script, so I\u2019ll leave it out of this blog. Keeping track of all values and saving them into a csv formatted file, will enable us to analyze the error data and helps tuning the correction by changing the gains (so quit some exercise and a healthy portion of patience). The picture below shows a dashboard used for analysis. Obvious I wasn\u2019t there yet. ;-0) If the tuning is done properly the error graphs will show nice curves, slowly approaching zero.RB2 is a differential driven robot: it has 2 sets of independent motors. For every side a separate controlled part is used. In theory both sets of motors should be running at the target speed at the same moment in time and the bot should run in a straight line. To tip it off, a third, balancing, PID can be used to correct the remaining differences between left and right. RB2 produced another challenge: I couldn\u2019t tune out the difference between the left and the right speed. I still don\u2019t know he reason for that (I switched motors, switched tires, reversed the wiring, tried another motor driver, changed the frame, replaced the battery pack, but couldn\u2019t close the gap). So, in my script  the balancing PID has the greatest weight in the total correction and the maximum of both encoder readings is used to calculate the distance made (adding another inaccuracy). However I do think this is the way to implement: first tune out the PID\u2019s for the motors. When the  desired result and behavior is reached, implement the balancing PID.All what\u2019s left for running in squares now, is making turns by exactly 90 degrees. And of course: \u2018Why should we ever want the bot to run in squares?\u2019", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F3H/PS16/IC37DIMU/F3HPS16IC37DIMU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Using a PID"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Driving (almost) straight, at a targeted speed and for a certain distance in centimeters is important for having the bot running squared trajectories, but we also need the bot to make turns at 90 degrees. A perfect 90 degree turn is again a target, but not always the reality. Also while turning there will be a lot of possible disturbances (e.g. slipping wheels). Using the encoders to control the turns enable us to get satisfactory results as close as possible to the target. The way this can be done is pretty straight forward: calculate the distance for the wheels to turn in ticks and have the bot turn until that specific amount of ticks have been reached. The steering part already provided the amount of ticks per degree (see the start of this blog). When multiplied by the amount of degrees to turn, we get the amount of ticks to produce.The amount of ticks per degree depends on the full turn perimeter. The value mentioned in the beginning of this blog is based on turning the bot with the wheels on both sides turning counter wise. In this case the center of the full turn perimeter is the center of the bot and the width of the bot corresponds to the diameter of the full turn perimeter. It is also possible to turn the bot by having the motors run at just one side of the bot. In that case the full width of the bot gives the radius of the full turn perimeter. The picture below shows the differences between both ways to turn. Depending on the chosen method the steering variable has to be calculated differently.  It\u2019s my personal opinion that the differential turn (both sides counter wise) will produce less disturbance and therefor better results (shorter turn, less friction on the wheels).Coding this as a function in Python, will allow us to use all different kind of angles. The only thing to keep in mind is that at least 1 tick has to be produced and that sets the minimum angle that can be used.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FIB/FWYZ/IC37DIB9/FIBFWYZIC37DIB9.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Control the Turns"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Well, so far for Dead Reckoning: continuously estimate, actuate and correct errors. Even when executed very well, it is still just a model of reality. I described already a lot of disturbances that will be no part of the model. So, by definition the bot will never run exactly (100%) straight or will ever turn by exactly 90 degrees.The impact of a deviation of the driving direction is substantial (when driving in a new direction, the bot will never end up where it\u2019s supposed to). That\u2019s a good reason for further calibrating. Fortunately there\u2019s a simple way to do that. Borenstein et. al. developed a method that\u2019s extensively described in: UMBMark - A Method for Measuring, Comparing, and Correcting Dead-reckoning Errors in Mobile Robots(  http://www-personal.umich.edu/~johannb/umbmark.ht... )In short this method comes down to: run a square clockwise and then run the same square counter clockwise. The picture below shows an emphasized projection of the real trajectory. CW and CCW are the errors that can be measured after running a square. The angle error can be calculated as: ( CW + CCW ) / Length of a square legOptional this error can be multiplied by a gain.

Now it is more difficult to fly but more satisfying when you can do it successfully. Flying straight and level is pretty difficult as you have to back off the power as it starts to rise. I have one more modification in mind for this trainer and that is to mount the motor onto a swiveling gimbal so that it will stay vertically up and down no matter where the motor arm is vertically. To get a more realistic movement in this trainer it probably requires some sort of \"smart\" counterbalance weight/lever that decreases the weight of the backside of the motor arm when the motor begins to rise vertically. As it currently is the trainer requires less power the higher the motor rises which is opposite of a real world copter.\u00a0 The great thing about a simple trainer like this is: it gives a real muscle memory learning experience in the requirement to control two axis of movement at the same time - \u00a0which is what you have to learn when you fly the real thing. And, you can't break this trainer whereas an expensive copter to a newbie is just a bunch of expensive parts waiting to get spread all over the ground.Photo 1:\u00a0First photo shows the entire trainer. Two jump rope handles and their bearings provide the two axis of rotation. A single servo rotates the motor axis thereby rolling the motor left or right and providing yaw movement around the vertical jump rope handle axis. The pitch, up and down movement is provided by the thrust of the motor.Photo 2:\u00a0Here is the servo which rotates the arm which holds the motor.Photo 3:\u00a0The electronics are an ESC motor controller, a radio receiver and a lipo battery. Only two channels of the ESC are required, one for the servo and one for the motor speed.Photo 4:\u00a0This shows two pieces of aluminum angle bracket bolted together and then bolted to the vertical jump rope handle bearing. The bearings are easy to pop out of the handle and a bolt goes right through the center of the bearing and then just pop the bearing back into the handle. Through the other side of the angle bracket I put a bolt that holds another piece of aluminum angle bracket which supports the motor arm handle.Photo 5: \u00a0This is the backside of the aluminum angle bracket that supports the motor arm handle.Photo 6:\u00a0Shot of the aluminum angle bracket holding a brushed motor and propeller. The arm itself is a piece of hollow fiberglass fishing pole.Photo 7: \u00a0Last photo is underneath shot of how I attached the servo to the angle bracket. Not very neat but it works.\u00a0  Primary materials to build:  - rc motor, propeller, radio, motor controller, lipo battery and servo  - two jump rope handles and bearings  - fiberglass fishing pole  - acrylic ruler to mount electronics on  - foot of aluminum angle bracket  - assorted bolts  - one shower curtain holder bracket  - a cigar box for base  - tools: soldering iron, drill, hack saw, screwdrivers and pliers", "title": "Flight Trainer II - Two Axis Movement", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Flight-Trainer-II-Two-Axis-Movement/", "section": "technology", "steps": [], "channel": "Remote Control"}]
