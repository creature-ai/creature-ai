Now as some of you may know I made a wind generator before and got a lot of good feedback. Now in the old one I left it up to you to decide what you wanted to do with the energy it put out. But not this time! If you were a little stuck or didn't know what to do with the energy I will be showing you how to turn wind into light! This is built using recycable material, giving trash new life! How does it work? The wind catchers catch the wind and rotate, while rotating it turns a stepper motor which acts as our generator. The stepper motor outputs around .6 volts to maybe a full 1volt, depending on how windy it is. That energy is then rectified to dc and stored in a nickle based rechargeable battery(what is stored is what is outputed). The energy stored in the battery is then toggled on by a swtich and runs through a joule theif. The joule theif takes the low voltage and steps it up enough to power 5 white leds. what are some factors to consider? There can be a few. One factor to consider is the stepper motor, you want one that is easy to turn and that can output at least half a volt at a slow RPM rate. It is best to test your motor before building this. Since the wind (another factor) isn't as consistent as the power coming out of your wall it is also hard to give an accurate charge time. In my area winter kinda came early this year bringing some strong winds, which works out well for this build.  So in short there are two factors really, the wind and the specs of your motor. All stepper motors are different. Some are hard to turn and some are easy, some output a decent voltage and some don't. ", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: "}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The wheel catcher wheel is what takes the wind and turns the motor. It is very easy to make. For this step all you will need is four pop bottles, four pop sicle sticks, hot glue and a few spare cds in which you won't miss. Follow these steps in order. 1- cut the tops off of four small pop bottles and put them to the side.2- grab your four sticks and wrap some electrical tape around them. This helps them become more durable. 3- hot glue the four sticks wrapped in tape spaced out around your CD4- mount the pop bottle tops on the sticks. This is easily done by making two notches in the top of the bottle and securing with hot glue. Be sure to cover up any space in the mouth of the bottle to prevent any air from pushing through and be sure to have them all facing in the same direction. 5- optional. Hot glue another CD over it to add a bit more strength.6- attach the stepper motor. I used a bottle cap to do this step. I drilled a small hole through the cap that just fit over the stepper motors gear and used hot glue to bond it. After this step is done blow into the wind catcher while holding the motor and watch how effortlessly it spins.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 2: Step 2"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "This step will be focusing on the full bridge rectifier. Its is four diodes in a certain order that converts alternating current into direct current. Which is what we will need to properly charge a battery. I think all stepper motors output AC some might output dc I am not sure on that part. But use a multimeter to find out :)In this step you will need four standard diode, solder and helping hands. First study the diagram and connect all the diodes together by twisting the leads together. Solder all the leads and trim them if needed. In a full bridge rectifier there are four connection points. two of those points are ac input and the other two are dc output with polarity. For the ac input connections it doesn't matter what wires from the motor are soldered to the connections. But it does matter for the DC output. The last picture has a circuit diagram again be sure to study it.After the full bridge rectifier is made you can connect the two wires from the stepper motor to the AC inputs of the bridge rectifier.

Which isn't enough to do anything really but for the theif it is all it needs! For this step you will need a 1k ohm resistor, npn transistor (2n3904), hand wound toroid, soldering iron and helping hands. First solder the 1k ohm to the middle leg (base) then solder the toroid. one wire will go to the resistor and the other will go to the collector. Then solder the led wires to the transistor. Since I am using 5 leds from a flash light I had to solder wires to the circuit board of the leds (nice circle PCB where the leds are mounted). Solder the positive wire or lead of the leds to the collector of the npn. Then solder the negative wire or lead of the leds to the emitter. Then take a 5 inch piece of wire and solder one end to the emitter as well. This will help us connect the battery in the other step. I will not be showing you how to make the toroid.

Using water while sanding will also keep the dust down. 1. Soak sheets of sandpaper in a bucket of water for 20 to 30 minutes before using them. Start sanding with a low-grit paper (300 grit) to remove large imperfections quickly. 2. Take the sandpaper out of the bucket and cut it to fit around a rubber sanding block. Wrap the sandpaper around the sanding block. Avoid wet sanding without a sanding block because your fingers will press onto the sanded material unevenly, wear the sandpaper out faster in those areas, and it may take longer to obtain an even sanding. 3. Spray the surface to be sanded with water, coating it evenly. The water will hide the scratch, so you will think it is gone when it isn't. Clean the water away from the area to see if it is really gone before moving on to other areas. 4. Sand the surface with progressively higher grits. Sandpaper is available in grits up to 4000, but it is OK to stop sanding after using 1200 to 2000- grit sandpaper.\u00a0\u00a0 Clean the surface in between grits to remove debris so the finer sandpaper is not contaminated with larger debris. Spray water onto the surface as needed. 5.

They also know that, in turn, the starter motor will rotate the motor vehicle, causing the first spark in the plugs and consequent explosion of fuel, after which the machine starts to work regularly, passing this time all its electrical components to be supplied by energy produced by the alternator. Yet they know that with the car running, the alternator also supplies the battery, keeping it in a position to return to power the vehicle when it is again fixed and is necessary that energy and also to carry out re-starting the engine.This operation as simple and harmonious alternator, when integrated into the car's system, coupled with the fact that component be easily acquired by low or even almost free in any sucateira, can make suppose to build a small wind generator handmade construction It could be the perfect choice as it rotated by the wind would produce energy that could be used at the time, or stored in batteries, to consume in the absence of wind.However the car alternator may not be the best choice for this type of project, unless it is introduced in even some changes in your electrical system, or the blades of the wind generator are very large, which does not It seems very feasible, a small homemade contraption.The reason an alternator will not be the ideal choice for a homemade wind system is due to the fact that perhaps many do not know, to be needed a lot of strength to rotate the shaft of the alternator when the latter, after reaching a certain number of rpm, starts production of energy.The driver of any vehicle, can not know the size of that effort unless it has extended knowledge about the functioning of the alternator. It is therefore evident that this effort is taken from the engine to the rotation of the alternator causes increase fuel consumption, which will be greater the greater is also the consumption of electrical energy, especially at night.But by the friction caused by the belt on pulleys, plus the effort that the car can be negligible, but that the wind generator can be a downside to consider.A direct connection turbine turbine to the alternator could avoid the friction of the inconvenience caused by the belt or belts in the transmission if not for the need to multiply the speed of the alternator, which further aggravates the problem of effort, because to achieve to obtain the minimum number of rotations required for the production of electricity by the alternator, which should be higher than 1,000 rpm, there is the absolute need to be a multiplication, because a small craft turbine never reach the minimum speed required even with strong winds.Just imagining ourselves driving a bike to stay with an idea of how stress increases when we use the system changes so that with fewer chainring turns to print more speed machine.Thus an alternator can never serve to generate busy energy by a small turbine driven by the wind, as it does in a car, because here the alternator is driven by power from an internal combustion engine, nothing comparable to the force exerted by the wind on the blades of a small turbine.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F44/L68N/IK004806/F44L68NIK004806.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: The Automotive Alternator Is Not for Wind Generator"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "One of the most important factors to consider when building a homemade wind generator is, without a doubt, its robustness and ability to withstand storms and high winds. No one will install such a device in a sheltered place, that would be a paradox, because what is natural is that it is, as much as possible, exposed to the wind. But also can not disassemble the machine and collect it when there are atmospheric situations of very strong wind, which is natural at certain times of year, it is absolutely necessary to build the machine so that it will endure not only with these winds seasonal strong, but with possible stormy phenomena that may occur.Having already encountered small wind generators destroyed or damaged by wind and noticed that in places where there were equipment in these, they are no longer there, I deduced that possibly would not have endured with the wind, and / or their owners have given up on them for any other reason.The truth is that my machine is six years ago exposed to atmospheric occurrences, in a place that is traditionally buffeted by strong winds and it seems only just been placed there. By chance, until it was once hit by a storm, but not directly, because what happened was that a roof of corrugated iron came loose and was reaching the guiding the generator, which was badly damaged, having been forced to make their replacement. Out of curiosity and to try to assess the strength of this storm, I mean that the roof was ripped off in full and the woodwork underneath was launched more than fifty meters away.This means that, with regard to robustness and safety of the machine, the construction was successful. Admittedly it was built in a very peculiar way and perhaps this has been so safe, which does not mean you should be a role model or not there are other better ways to build such a device, but the truth is that I have, through research on the Net, read and seen, through videos, many home generators that possibly will not be built in a very safe manner. It should be noted that it can be very dangerous, in days of strong wind, sitting next to a device that has not been built safely. My opinion is that one should look not only at the most technical part of the project and the successful attainment of generating energy but also to the strength of the set, because otherwise it is not worth this success, which can be very ephemeral and end the first storm.In the case of my generator even I believe I could have built a turbine diameter slightly larger, with wider and long blades because its strong structure, certainly that would endure the impact of wind. A larger turbine would have the advantage of printing more power to the machine and to run more easily in low wind conditions. I consider that this was a design error, but in any case, this error can be corrected by removing one turbine and building a bigger, what I'm equating do just that has a more suitable generator for this project than what there It is currently an automobile alternator.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FRB/2H60/IK0047Z2/FRB2H60IK0047Z2.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: The Machine Should Be Resistant to Endure the Wind"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "The robustness and security of my wind generator starts right at the base. It is perfectly based upon a small house built of stone and the tower that supports the generator in addition to not be too high consists of a pipe of 20cm in diameter than the background is still somewhat wider. This tube was filled with concrete based on a shoe that was built on the roof of the house it is also in cement concrete.On top of this cylindrical pillar was built a piece of iron pipe, tapped a metal anchor of the works. This piece of tube about 30 cm long, with at the bottom a bearing, which will become another piece of pipe, this extracted from the inside of the strut, namely the male, that tube having holes to put the bolts.This narrow tube is threaded into the wider tube that is embedded in the tower, but then goes up and at the top he was applied to extracted part of an old washing machine, ask the one that holds the bearings and shaft where belt pulley and the turbine at the other end. For a better understanding of the operation of scheme, we can say that the turbine generator is the drum of the washing machine and the alternator is the motor that rotates through the belt and pulley, except that here precisely the opposite happens, of course.The so-called tube detached from the metal anchor, from the tower top is embedded within the larger tube and wrapped in cement and iron, not only to better hold the part of the bearings, but also for the whole become heavier and there is no risk of Tower undocking. Bearing that was in the tower hole bottom, allows the joint to rotate easily when it is driven by the wind hitting the advisor.As the turbine it has a diameter of 1.35m and is comprised of ten blades with length 0.45 m by 0.15 m wide. These blades are made of stainless metal that has been extracted from the interior of a dishwasher. Its great advantage is that it need not be painted because it does not rust and is of unlimited duration. The frame that supports consists of tubular metal rods that are embedded in a piece of round tube which in turn is hooked to the shaft of the washing machine where the drum had been before. These metal rods of the frame pass, at the base of the blades by means of a circular metal piece that is neither more nor less than a rim of a wooden barrel. This ratchet makes the metal rim of the rods that hold the blades and the whole is further enhanced with galvanized iron wires arranged in a circle in the middle and at the tip of the blades.The alternator was attached to the top tube, through an application to the belt tension and has a small metal cover to stay with some shelter from the sun or rain. With a crank bike, a piece of wood and some metal staples was improvised a system of brushes, to allow the pass current through a cable into the home, without there being any kinks in the cable, as this was previously built inside the tower and connected to small metal alloys circling the top of the tower.Finally, I will talk about the tail or the turbine advisor. This element was produced from the sheet metal of the same machine washing which has been extracted from the rotor shaft and is screwed to a tubular square iron resting upon a piece of round tube having on top a metal application to allow placing the guiding an angle of 90 degrees with the turbine, so that it receives the wind from the front, laterally or else going to receive the wind turbine like a flag. The change of position has to be done manually, but it is important to do in case of a forecast of unusually high winds or when you want to have the generator stopped. The piece of pipe which is based stem from the advisor is just there so that this element is placed in line with the center of the turbine, which is only for a better visual appearance, because otherwise it would not be necessary.I painted a Cross of Christ in guiding because I think it bears some resemblance to the sails of Portuguese ships bearing this symbol. Sailing is on the wind, it is the wind that moves these ships, which also happens with the wind turbine.

We also need to know how well those systems work. If making electricity is your priority and you don't live in an area that gets a lot of wind then you need to forget about building a wind turbine and invest in a solar system. As for me, I have always been fascinated by wind operated devices like windmills, whirligigs and wind turbines. I decided to build myself a wind turbine just for the fun of it. I did not expect to get a lot of power out of it since I live in a relative low wind location. However, I figured I could at least use it to charge my cordless power tool batteries. My expectations and excitement started to rise dramatically while researching the project. I read dozens of internet DIY posting and watched twice that many YouTube videos of people showing how they built their systems and the huge amounts of power they were producing. I saw voltage outputs from turbines that ran as high as 45+ volts. I saw one guy that had two 500 Amp Hour deep cycle marine batteries being charged by a wind turbine not too different from mine. He claimed he ran half his house off that turbine. I knew if my system could produce even a small fraction of the power others said their systems were producing I could not only charge my power tool batteries but I could also power my energy efficent shop lighting system. I was seeing Green Energy Stars. The stars in my eyes quickly vanished when my turbine was all built and operating. I found out that even my cordless power tool battery charging expectations were as inflated as the power production claims I saw all over the internet. It is apparent that gas mileage and fish sizes are not the only things people tend to exaggerate. My system produces enough power to charge my cell phone battery (occasionally) but that is about all it will do. I am not complaining. My power expectations were low when I decided to build the system. The fact is I did not build it to produce power. I built it because I wanted to. That is what makers do; we build stuff just for the fun of it. I don't get a lot of power from it but I got a lot of satisfaction out of building it. I also enjoy watching it spin in the wind. If I add the small amount of power I get to the huge satisfaction I experience then my wind turbine is well worth the effort and money I put into it. If you are building for power alone then follow my suggestion and invest in solar panels instead.A PERSONAL NOTE - I realize that I am going to catch a lot of flack in the comments section from people that either have never built and operated a wind turbine or that know nothing about ohm's law and how to calculate power.

Six 15 inch blades cost me about $20 and gave me a turbine that measures about a meter in diameter. I had a permanent magnet DC treadmill motor. It seems these type motors and some select automobile alternators are what most people use in their wind turbines. This all looked pretty simple and easy until I discovered the odd size left hand threads on the treadmill motor shaft. I could not find a nut anywhere that would fit that thing. A review of the internet resources showed that everybody with a treadmill motor had to solve this problem but nobody I saw chose to share how they did it. To get around this little problem I decided I would just drill and tap holes in the big cast iron flywheel on the motor and use it as a hub for the blades. That idea was quickly abandoned when I discovered that the flywheel  had 13 really thick metal fins cast into its backside. 13 fins means there are also 13 flat spots. There was no way to divide those 13 flat spots and evenly space any number of blades on it (other than one or 13 blades). No matter how i tried to figure it I was going to end up trying to drill and tap one of those blasted fins. Without a nut to fit the shaft and a flywheel I couldn't use as a hub I decided to buy a flat steel hub (another $15) and modify the flywheel so I could use it as a nut. To accomplish the flywheel to nut conversion I drilled 1/4 inch holes all around the edge of the belt hub on the flywheel. I drilled the holes as close together as I could. I then went back and ran a 3/8 inch drill bit through those same holes. That took out the metal between the holes and left me with a motor shaft nut with really ragged edges. I used a belt sander to smooth the rough drilled edges of the nut. I drilled and taped two 1/4 inch holes in the nut so I could lock it to the shaft. There are other ways one could accomplish the conversion from flywheel to nut but this worked great for me and didn't require machine shop tools I don't have.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FEM/7LO2/I600BI2E/FEM7LO2I600BI2E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUT/QOYG/I600BI2D/FUTQOYGI600BI2D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH8/9D1P/I600BI0L/FH89D1PI600BI0L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3C/VGC6/I600BI59/F3CVGC6I600BI59.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV1/ARXM/I600BI55/FV1ARXMI600BI55.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: The DC Generator"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "I bolted the turbine blades to the steel hub I bought and put the whole assembly on the motor shaft only to discover another problem.

I found a really small one on Ebay for $10. It has 10 tiny wires coming out of each of the two ends. I divided the wires into bundles of 5 wires each.

If I had paid more attention when initially researching this project I would have noticed that everybody talked about the voltage output of their system but not one person mentioned the power (watts). Watts is the true measure of how much electricity is being produced. Volts alone means nothing. My system can produce over 40 volts in moderate wind with no load but when I add a load the voltage drops drastically. When I saw the extremely low output of my system I went back and did more research to try and find out why my power production was so much lower than the systems I saw on the internet. This time I stayed away from YouTube videos and the DIY blogs. What I found that time was amazing. There are literally thousands of reliable websites that explain the physics behind the low output my system. As it turns out there is nothing wrong with my system. It is operating properly.

What did I make? I made a Adjustable Ribbon Generator that takes advantage of low wind speeds to produce electricity. This Ribbon Generator allows for the adjustment of the tension of the ribbon which will allow it to work better in a larger range of wind speeds. How Did I make? Using materials bought from the local hardware store I constructed this ribbon generator using a limited amount of tools, and a limited amount of \u00a0knowledge on the art of making things. The construction of this ribbon generator is simple enough that almost anyone could build it and start producing energy from the wind! Where did I make it? I constructed the whole ribbon generator at my house. the construction took a little over a week and the testing took about a weekend. What Did I Learn? There are many things to learn in this project, I for one, finally learned how to properly use an\u00a0oscilloscope. I learned some new building techniques in the project. And I learned how much fun it was to build things! For a while I have been researching ribbon generators as a new form of using the wind to generate electricity. The beauty of ribbon generators is that they do not require a lot of wind to work (about 2mph), and they are a really cheap and easy way to generate electricity. Almost anyone can build one. The problem with current ribbon generators, such as the Windbelt is that the ribbon cannot be adjusted for different wind speeds. My idea for this project was to build a ribbon generator that would allow the ribbon to be tightened or loosened for different wind speeds, therefore allowing it to generate more electricity in a larger range of wind speeds. Right now this ribbon generator requires a person to manually adjust the ribbon. But it should be easy to integrate a servo motor and an arduino to automatically tighten the ribbon generator. For anybody who doesn't know what a ribbon generator is or how it works, a ribbon generator takes advantage of the aeroelastic flutter effect to generate electricity.

Since this entire project has a budget of just about $1000, it is meant to be able to be completed by both newcomers to wind energy as well as those who don't have a lot of money to throw around. I also tried to use as much recycled material as possible, so a large portion of this turbine is made from a junked car and metal that was going to be thrown out by fabricators. When I first began this project I had a decent grasp of electricity and electronics, which was helpful. I knew hardly anything about wind turbine design, but picked it up quickly with the use of several books and websites. The books and works that have been most influential in the building of this wind turbine include: -Windpower Workshop by Hugh Piggot -Windpower by Paul Gipe -Arc Welding Instructions for the Beginner by The James F.

I also didn't have a lot of metal fabrication shops available to me, so I was looking for something that required little fabrication. A Volvo brake rotor has become popular among homebrew windpower enthusiasts because of its wide availability and its relative ease of modification. Volvos have a reputation for being long lasting and their rotors are not much different. A trip to the junkyard landed me with a $20 Volvo 340 strut (rotor, spring, and everything). A single rotor design only has one set of magnets that spin in front of a stator coil. This makes construction easier and less dangerous, since you don't have to use \"jacking screws\" to bring together two magnetic disks. This is dangerous because if you slip, you could very well break your hand or finger. With a single rotor design, there is much less chance of this. One thing that many people don't realize about wind turbines is that the blades of a particular turbine are matched to its generator. This is all based on what is called \"Tip Speed Ratio\" or TSR. By matching the correct blade diameter to your generator, you ensure that the turbine will start generating at a certain wind speed. By having the right size blades and generator, the correct RPM and torque will be produced to generate the maximum amount of power safely (that is without overheating or over-speeding the turbine). Matching the blades to the generator is a very important aspect of designing your windmill, and many other aspects of the machine are based on the blade diameter. For this particular design the blade diameter should be around 7 feet.

This is called \"furling\" and is very important to protect the wind turbine in high winds. Do not underestimate the amount of power in a strong gust of wind, as it can seriously damage a wind machine. To have the turbine turn out of the wind, the generator and blades are mounted off to the side of a yaw bearing. We mounted our generator about 6 inches away from the center. This is overkill for this size generator, but we'll be playing it safe as this will cause the machine to furl earlier.  In addition to mounting the generator at an offset, the tail will be mounted to specification to allow the generator to turn while the tail stays straight. We removed the spring and the inner cylinder of the Volvo strut with a cutting torch.  We also removed the rotor (to be modified later) and the piece of metal behind it. Then, the remaining piece of the strut was cut in half and welded onto the side. We also added a piece of metal to give another place to attach the stator to.

A very thorough knowledge of permanent magnet generators is needed to calculate how to wind an optimal stator. If you are determined to do it, you can simply follow the example of someone else's successful generator. Again, this being my first shot at windpower, I didn't want to risk winding the wrong thing, messing up the wiring, or ruining the casting, so I bought one from Otherpower.com. They make lots of different stators for a variety of magnets (rectangular and round) and voltages. Most axial flux wind turbines use a three phase stator for more efficient generation. Since this is a single rotor design (stators on Otherpower are usually made for dual rotors) we will only be generating half the stated voltage. So, for this project I wanted 12 volts and had to buy a 24 volt stator. Otherpower actually is now offering a kit for a single rotor wind turbine that is pretty much the same as this one.  It's still cheaper to fabricate your own, though.The stator is made for a 12 inch rotor, but the Volvo brake rotor is only 10 inches. So, we were forced to add on to the outside edge. This was probably not the best solution, but it should work fine. I would recommend getting a 12 inch steel disk from a CNC water jet if possible, which would be a lot cleaner and provide a better surface to mount blades. We used a piece of 1/2 inch plywood mounted to the strut and then mounted the stator to the plywood. Make sure there is clearance for the stator coil to clear the wheel bearing.

We used heavy duty epoxy to ensure that the magnets won't fly off at high RPMs. Be VERY careful when you put these magnets into place - they have enough power to severely injure or break your fingers! I found that a little caution and a rubber hammer were invaluable tools. The magnets are placed in alternating polarities on the back of the rotor. We used a small magnet to test each magnet's polarity.  I left the magnets exposed, but I am planning on a possible renovation soon. I should've cast the magnets in some sort of resin to prevent corrosion. There is plenty of good information on the internet on how to do this, and it's very similar to casting a stator coil. Once all the magnets are on the rotor, remember that the whole disk is now one gigantic magnet. Do not set it on a workbench with metal shavings or magnet-sensitive materials!

This ensures that furling takes place at the right wind speed. The tail boom should generally be about as long as the radius of the turbine (one blade length). In this case, it should be around 3.5 feet. In reality we made it quite a bit longer by mistake. It still seems to find the wind alright, but I think it will effect furling. As for the area of the tail vane, it can be determined by a simple equation: D(squared) / 40 = Area of the Tail Vane (where D is the diameter in your unit of choice). This equation is given by Hugh Piggot who has many years of small wind turbine experience.The shape of the tail vane really has very little effect on the mill as long as the area is correct, so feel free to get creative. I spent some time with an air grinder and cut out a neat looking tail, but it's not entirely necessary. What does matter is the angle at which the tail is mounted. It needs to be at about 45 degrees from directly behind the center post on the opposite side of the generator. In addition to that, it should be mounted at a 20 degree angle from perpendicular - the pictures I've included illustrate this nicely. This may need to be adjusted slightly depending on when you want to mill to furl and how heavy the tail vane is. The tail is made of electrical tubing and brazed together. We put a lot of supporting pieces in the middle of it to strengthen it. The tail vane is made of stainless steel and it is riveted onto the tubing.

My woodworking skills are pretty basic and making your own blades requires some pretty good attention to detail. So I decided to save myself the time and effort of making blades and just buy a ready made set. There are lots of guides and tutorials for blade-making online. Hugh Piggot even offers a nice table of useful figures for different blade diameters in Windpower Workshop. Now, there is a lot to consider when buying blades. First and foremost, consider the power you are taking from the wind. This is based mostly on the diameter of your wind turbine blades. A wind turbine steals energy from the wind by slowing it down as it passes through the blades and makes the rotor turn. This is all laid out mathematically by the Betz' Limit. These calculations show the maximum amount of energy that is possible to be extracted from the wind, though they do not account for losses in generator efficiency... they also assume that you have infinite blades which all have no drag, and if you can hook me up with some of that, I'd be very interested :). It isn't so simple as bigger blades equals more power, though! No, no, no. What is most important is that you match the blades to your generator. Generators are designed to start producing usable electricity (the voltage you want) at a certain RPM. This is where the Tip Speed Ratio comes in. Basically, you want to have blades that provide that RPM at the most typical wind speed you'll be experiencing. Sound complicated? It is, kind of. Usually the Tip Speed Ratio (TSR) is an indicator of efficiency, but beware of websites claiming abnormally high TSR's! I would recommend using it as a rule of thumb. There really is a lot to blade making as well as blade theory, but that should give you some good general insight into what you're trying to accomplish. As for me, I bought my blades from a website called Magnet4less (no 's'). At first I actually bought the wrong size blades thinking I could get away with a bigger diameter, but alas, physics wins again (Some of the pictures may have these first blades in them). I eventually folded and bought the 6.8 ft. diameter blades. However, I would NOT recommend buying these blades again. They have terrible reviews from wind power people around the country and with my personal experience they look like the angle of attack just isn't enough to spin up high RPMs. This is the part where I suggest another retailer but, to tell you the truth, I really don't know of one. Homebrew wind turbines enthusiasts seem to be mostly (but I could be corrected) out of luck for high quality universal blades with different diameters. I suppose you could use a pair of replacement blades from another commercial turbine assuming they are to your needs.

Obviously a good spot with lots of wind and few obstructions is optimal. Most DIY wind power enthusiasts recommend that your tower be 30 feet above the nearest obstruction within a 300 foot radius. In other words, pretty much as high and in the most open area as you can get it.Selecting a location and tower is difficult, there is no doubt about it. It's hard on your wallet and your time. The biggest concern when putting up a tower should always be safety. This is a homebrew turbine and could run into problems that we can't quite predict, so a little extra safety is always good. Be aware that if your blades fail at high RPMs if they will fly quite a distance and could pose a threat to nearby houses or cars. A basic run down of the tower options available. -Monopole tower  No guy wires, requires a lot of concrete and are almost always very expensive. -Tilt down pipe or lattice tower  Used by the majority of the DIY Wind Power community because of cost and ability to tilt the machine down for maintenance.  Uses guy wires and a hinge at the bottom of the tower and can be welded together with the correct pipe.-Lattice tower  Another choice is to construct a lattice that does not tilt down but still has guy wires. The problem with this is that it must be climbed to do anything to the windmill. Many people do not feel safe doing this and many people have been hurt from falling off stationary towers like this. Use extreme caution and a safety harness to work on top of one of these towers. I was fortunate enough to receive a free 30 foot lattice tower from an airport. It was once used for a rotating beacon and should be strong enough for my small wind turbine. I had to add to the top of it (about 5 feet) to attach the wind turbine with enough clearance for the blades to move around when the machine furls. For support, we welded gussets onto a piece of 2 inch pipe and attached it to the top of the tower. Then I took a piece of schedule 80 pipe to a machine shop and had it turned down on the lathe so it would act nicely as the yaw bearing. We leveled it on the tower and placed some set screws in so it could be welded in place. This piece is important because, if it comes loose, the whole turbine could fall off or the blades could hit the tower! YIKES!Welding was completed with a DC arc welder.  I'm still not terrific at welding by any means, but it's a great skill to learn. Before I made the welds on the tower, I did some practicing on some scrap pieces I acquired from a metal shop. That's another thing you find while trying to learn to weld - people in metal shops are usually quite friendly and willing to help out. If you're thinking about learning but are lacking material to practice on, ask around - what many might consider junk could be very useful to you.

The project shifted locations, though, and I decided to charge a battery instead of heat water, so I decided against it. I did have a rough idea of what I was going to do, but I think not making the controller on my first turbine was probably a good decision. Things can get dangerous if your controller fails and lets your turbine run away at reckless RPMs. Also, believe it or not, electrical permits prefer stuff that's UL listed... who'd have thought that?Instead of heating water, I decided to charge a 12 volt battery that would be hooked up to a light. This cut down on costs, logistics, and other restrictions that made it a bit easier to install. I settled on using two Xantrex C40 charge/dump controllers. One regulates the charge coming in and the other watches the charge level of the battery to ensure it is not overcharged (it can't do both at the same time). I have a 12 volt dump load that is a water heating element, rated for 600 watts. I used a three phase disconnect switch as the \"brake\" on the wind turbine. When the switch is closed, all three phases of the wind turbine are shorted out and it will slow itself down. I also used a 750 watt modified sine wave inverter to run the light. The light has a photoelectric eye on it and is wired up to turn on at night.

Now, a lot of people have a lathe, a tachometer and a bunch of other fancy tools to test their generators. Well, I am a bit less fortunate and do not have those available to me. So, instead, I made a simple jig to spin up my generator using an electric drill. I cut a notch in a small piece of wood and shaped it as a trapezoid to avoid all the holes for the bolts. On the other side, I screwed through a hole in the metal into the wood to hold it in place. The other two planned attachment places were too close to the edge to take a screw, so I drilled a couple of small holes and used small zip-ties. Surprisingly, this setup is pretty solid. The piece of wood doesn't act like it's going anywhere and those zip-ties are nice and snug. Now, with all of these funny angles and stuff, it's hard to find the exact center of the rotor. I did the best I could to eyeball it and I drilled two more long screws partway into the wood on either side of the center. Then use an allen wrench with a T-handle on it that is long enough to touch these two screws. These screws will take the torque from the drill to spin up the generator.

Mainly a couple of good multimeters, a test load, and some way to read the RPM. I attempted to use the equipment in my physics lab and Datastudio to measure the frequency of the AC current, then I tried to work backwards to figure out the RPM of the generator. If I remember correctly, I had to divide by 6 to get the RPMs. This method, however... was extremely inaccurate. I kept getting readings that were very off. Despite the pretty graphs the equipment was generating, I would not recommend trying to use this method for measuring RPM. Many people use fancy bicycle tachometers with good results. Some bicycle tachometers can be found for under $20. Luckily my physics teacher is an avid bicycle rider and had a box full of old bicycle computers that he let me try out. I found one with an RPM counter and zip tied a neodymium magnet onto one side of the testing jig. Then I used a ring stand and a clamp to hold the sensor in place. Now I could read the RPMs fairly easily, although they didn't update immediately this method was far more accurate. I would highly suggest if you want accurate readings to get a decent tachometer or a bicycle computer with an RPM setting. I was also able to use Datastudio to measure the DC voltage coming off the generator. The equipment only measured up to 10 volts DC, so I used a simple voltage divider to scale down the voltage being read by the computer. This allowed the computer to read 1/12 the voltage being produced. So the actual voltage on the graph was 12 times voltage read by the computer. See pictures for the schematic. The voltage across R2 should be 1/12 the voltage of the generator, this is shown in the graph.Also, I needed to flatten out the DC coming off the rectifier. To do this I used a big capacitor in parallel to flatten out the voltage spikes, giving a more accurate DC voltage reading. You have to watch a lot of things when you spin up the generator. It's hardest to measure voltage, current and rpm while still holding onto the drill. For my test load, I used six 18 ohm 25 watt resistors in parallel for a total of 3.6 ohms.

It's not a bad idea to consider the soil you'll be digging into, as some places may need more of a footing just to be sure. Luckily for me, since this project was being funded, we were able to talk the local concrete place into doing it all for free. They even dug a hole and centered a piece of pipe in the casing for us. Also, consider how you want to attach your tower to the base. My first thought was to have tree bolts sticking up from the base (one for each leg), but the wind turbine installer suggested something different. He suggested we put a piece of plate or something on the bottom with a hole in it, then have one solid pipe or piece of bar stock in the base and slide the tower down over. This does a couple of things. Firstly, it allows the tower to move, which is nice, and secondly, it reduces stress on the concrete base because the pipe is centered on the casting.

This figure was based off of some other towers I had read about as well as the suggestion of the wind turbine installer. It's a good idea to get a friend to help you put in the anchors, since pouring concrete by yourself isn't much fun. The anchors we used were 4 foot long screw anchors (but we didn't actually screw them in). The backhoe dug the holes and then we put in the anchors with concrete. I screwed the anchors in slightly to keep them in place while we poured the concrete. I used four 80lb bags of quickcrete in each hole. This was simply an estimation; I know very little about concrete and felt this was plenty (and I am pretty sure it was). I let the quickcrete dry and then backfilled the holes.

Most people will just swap out the generator for a typical 12 volt AC Delco 10-SI alternator. The problem with doing this is, you have to change just about every component (or install drop down resistors), and bulbs. This is OK if you have a donor car or access to all the parts but if not what is a cheaper, easier, yet just as effective alternative? Go with a 6 volt alternator!Voltage and amps explained:The only thing you do not have to do when going to 12 volts is replace the wiring since doubling the voltage will drop the amps in half. The thickness of the wire has to do with amps, not voltage.I think 6 volt automotive systems get a bad wrap. Dim lights, slow wipers, etc. It's not the voltage but the fact most generators produce low amps (~30 amps) and don't charge well (if all) at idle or low engine speeds. Also 6V electrical systems haven't been used in years so by now, there is lots of resistance in the system due to corroded connectors anyway.Think about it. The United States uses 110V AC at 60 HZ where other countries use 220V at 50 HZ. Are their electrical systems really any better than what we use? Just because they double their voltage?The only bad thing I can really say about 6 volt electrical systems is bulbs are typically more expensive and the lack of modern components available for 6 volt systems like radios. But because the voltage is doubled, the amps drop in half. So you can get by with using smaller wiring. I suppose at some point automakers figured if they doubled the voltage they could use less copper and save money. Who knows maybe one of these days 24 volts will eventually become the new standard in automotive electrical systems if the price of copper goes out the roof.Not saying 6V electrical systems are better than 12V systems, but if someone can explain why 12 volts became the standard other than getting by with smaller wiring, then I'd like to hear it.In my case, I had added several components to my 1981 Trabant 601. The last car in production on the planet still using a 6 volt electrical system until IFA went to a 12 volt alternator in 1984. Some components I've added go through a 6 to 12 volt converter such as my radio, fuel guage, electronic ignition, LED backup light licence plate frame. It wasn't until I added a 12V electronic ignition did my generator light start to glow at times because it pulls more amps than the other 12 volt components combined. I also upgraded from the standard 40/45 watt R2 incandescent headlamp bulbs to brighter 50/55 wattt H4s and 55 watt auxillary lamps which come on with the high beams. So just the high beams and auxillary lamps alone almost exceed the 220 watt generator/regulator's capacity. It was clear I needed more electrical power!", "title": "Install a 6 Volt Alternator on Your Old Car!", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Install-a-6-volt-alternator-on-your-old-car/", "section": "workshop", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The alternator:This is a typical AC Delco SI-10 model.

My main reason was my car is air cooled and has no temperature guage. So I needed some way to alert me if the V-belt broke. Plus the \"one wire\" versions I've read don't react the voltage drops and there is no way to get a charge indicator lamp to work.

With this step you may need to find a wiring diagram for your car. But the wiring going to and from the old generator and external regulator are probably not much different than my car.First the alternator. There are three wires involved. One is a thick wire (8 AWG) that runs from the post on the alternator to the post on the starter. This wire will overlap a thicker wire which goes to the POS post on the battery. On the GM regulator, there is a connector with two smaller wires, a white (maybe yellow) and a red wire. The white wire is the field wire. The red wire is the sensing wire.The white (or yellow) wire get's it's power from the ignition switch (when on) through an indicator light in series.If the alternator produces no power, it grounds the bulb and lights it up. If you chose not to use a bulb as an indicator, then substitute a resistor. I don't know what size because in my case I wanted an indicator lamp. Don't run this wire directly from the ignition switch to the field wire on the alternator! The red wire is the sensing wire. This wire is connected downstream to compensate for an voltage drops say to the fusebox or some other junction point and is powered at all times. You can connect it directly to the post on the alternator but this is not ideal. See the link I posted above.Generator/external regulator:At the regulator there were five wires. Three of which went to the generator. An input, output and a ground. Once the generator and it's wiring harness were removed, this left me with two wires. A thick red wire and a small blue wire.The thick red wire went to the starter post, ignition switch and fusebox. The small blue wire powered the external regulator and also served as the charge indicator. Luckily the indicator lamp on my car was wired in series just like on a GM vehicle. I chose to run a new 8 AWG wire directly from the alternator to the starter. I connected the red sensing wire to the old power wire which is downstream to compensate for any voltage drops. Then the blue wire connects to the field wire (yellow or white).If you are not sure which wire powered the old regulator, pull the indicator lamp socket out of the dash (if there is one). Make sure it's wired in series and it's color and trace it down to the regulator. Disconect it from the regulator and start the engine. The light should be out. Now touch this wire to ground and see if it lights up. If so then connect it back to the regulator and if the light goes out, if so then your good to go!The regulated output wire from the regulator will most likely be a thick wire and have power on it at all times.If your regulator has more than 2 wires once the generator and the wires that go to it are removed, you'll need to get a wiring diagram for your car or trace these wires down to see where they go. They may just be additional regulated output wires which goto the fusebox and can be tied together. Two of which may go to an ammeter guage. Or an additional ground wire.Make sense so far?", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FEF/KZFF/I1NUG8Z6/FEFKZFFI1NUG8Z6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC5/J1OM/I1NUG2ZK/FC5J1OMI1NUG2ZK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZE/USIA/I1NUG2ZY/FZEUSIAI1NUG2ZY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVP/7SRZ/I1NUG30C/FVP7SRZI1NUG30C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP9/TZTI/I1NUG319/FP9TZTII1NUG319.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: The Wiring"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "As when working on an electrical system, it's a must that the negative post be disconnected.

It's best to use a 60 amp fuse between the alternator and starter when in doubt.Now start the car and using a voltage meter check for voltage directly at the battery.

ATO fuses are far superior to the old type. ATO fuses will actually blow if you feed too much current through them. The older type fuses will only blow if short circuited.

Draw a random triangle into the base of the led and find the center of each line.  Using the right triangle, draw a line that is the perpendicular bisector of each of the triangle's sides.  They should all converge to a central point which is the center of the circumscribed circle, the LED.  Geometry class actually helped in a real life situation!

Linear, tactile or clicky from Kailh or Cherry MX. Choose whichever you like. I used the Kailh switches because they were cheap on Ailexpress. If you choose to use the PCB you'll need Kailh BOX switches. The colour determines the feeling.The electronic componentsNot much to explain about them in this chapter, but if you dont use the PCB I would recomend just normal trough hole components for soldering ease. Unfortunately the leds used are not available in trough hole packages. I would also not recommend to use wires on SMD packages unless you are Very confident in your soldering skills. Even for SMD on a PCB \"advanced\" soldering skills are equired.The housingI do provide a housing in this project, but it is at this moment flawed. Modifications are needed to fit bolts, the openings for the leds are not optimal, the arduino is exposed and a part needs to be cut out for the USB to fit. In the future a new housing may be added. If you have a 3D printer go ahead and print it, but please don't go out of your way to print this flawed case if you dont and just use some kind of project box.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FCE/G9LM/JKSZQQN3/FCEG9LMJKSZQQN3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Materials and Explanations"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The schematic for this project is rather simple, but I want to explain the components for the people who are interested and don't know this implementation.Switch connections to the ArduinoThe switches are connected to Arduino pins 0, 2 and 3 because those pins can be used as external interrupts. This is further explained in the code section.The debounce circuitOn the left side of the schematic is a circuit that is copied 3 times. This circuit is used to debounce the switch. To know what debouncing is you need to understand switch bouncing and it's not hard to understand. First look at this simulation to paint a first picture (click the switch fast and look at the signal below) http://tinyurl.com/yajdtndwWhen you press or release a switch it bounces and your signal alternates between high and low a couple of times for a few milliseconds. An Arduino is really fast and reads every high and low in this short time. The program will send a key press or release every time a high or low is read so with every press your computer will receive multiple key presses. Not ideal for a rhythm game.This debounce circuit will slow down the falling edge of the signal. The signal to the Arduino won't be able to change as fast as the bouncing occurs so it will be read as one press. Don't worry about it falling to slow for the next real press because it will.  Advanced:The Atmaga32U4 reads a digital low at 0.2Vcc - 0.1V = 0.9 volt. The voltage of the capacitor at any time in its discharge is Vcc * e^(-t/RC). If you measure a different debounce time on your switch  you can calculate your resistor and capacitor values.formula form https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/rc/rc_2.htmlThe LEDsThe rgb LEDs are APA102 leds which are individually addressable using a clock and data line. No external components are needed to make them work. For many LEDs you should use a capacitor parallel to 5 volt and ground but with just 4 LEDs you don't need it.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8N/TJ5Q/JKSZQN8J/F8NTJ5QJKSZQN8J.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: The Schematic"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "The PCB was designed in JLCPCB.

I only needed to add a component for the switches, but after watching some video's I got the hang of it. The only thing flaw I realised is the placement of the holes is a bit too close to the switches.To order the PCB go to https://jlcpcb.com/ and choose the 2 layered option.

Your switches need to be firmly placed and unable to move. I've provided pictures of the square cutouts with dimensions so you can use it for your own design assuming you use Kailh BOX switches.AssemblyNow you have all components needed to assemble. There is an order to assembling this first version because the switches are soldered. 1. Solder the SMD components. these are the resistors, capacitors and LEDs.2. Solder the Arduino pro micro.3. Place the 3 switches in the 3D printed coverplate before soldering. The coverplate can't be removed after soldering the switches. Desoldering the switches is not advised and may destroy them. 4. Now solder the switches in place. Do this as quickly as possible because the plastic switches can melt and ruin them or drastically decrease their number of clicks.  5. Place the assembled coverplate in the 3D printed case and secure with tape or use bolts if they dont interfere with the keycaps.6. Place the keyCaps on the switches and you're done.RecomendationsDesolder or mask the LEDs on the arduino after uploading your code.

However i'll try to explain what's going on as best as i can. Some things are explained later on in this tex so if you have questions please first read the whole thing.Uploading the codeFirst download all 3 \".ino\" files and put them in one folder. If you don't have the Arduino IDE just download it for free on the official arduino site. https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/SoftwareConnect your Arduino to your PC and open \"OSU_Keyboard_code_V1.ino\". In Tools --> Board select \"Arduino/Genuino Micro\". Also in Tools select the right COM port. This can sometimes change.To upload the code to your Arduino just click on the arrow on the top left of the screen and wait until it tells you it completed in the bottom left. OSU_Keyboard_code_V1Including and definingFirst you need to include the Keyboard library. This makes it possible to use the Arduino as a keyboard.Next I define some values. Define is just like a variable but they can't change while the program is running. The first 9 are for the keyboard character, arduino pin number and port bits. Then the port bits of the LED data and clock.Also the number of leds is defined and a variable for the angle of the color wheel.SetupThis part of the code will only be executed once when the arduino is plugged in.First the clock and data pins of the LEDs are set as outputs and the switch pins as inputs. This is the the advanced version of pinMode(). If you are interested search for \"direct port manipulation\". https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/PortManipulati...Keyboard.begin() simply starts the usb connection as keyboard.Next 3 interrupts are are linked to the switch pins. Every time a change is detected on the switch pin a tiny program will be executed. This little program will be made further on.LoopThis part will continuously repeat while the arduino is powered.I only use it to change and update the color of the LEDs.InterruptsHere the little programs, which will only be executed when a change is detected on the switch pins, are made. They are identical except for which pin they react to.First it checks if the button is pressed or released and sends the correct keyboard command.LED (explained in a different order)If you are curious how the LEDs are controlled you should look at the APA102 datasheet. https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/APA102.pd...OneBitThis is again the direct port manipulation version of digital write.First it checks if it should send a 0 or 1 and respectively pulls the data pin low or high. Then it writes the clock pin high very short and writes it low again.OneByteThis repeats oneBit 8 times with a \"for\" loop. It reads the first bit in a byte and passes its value to the oneBit function and does the same for the next 7 bits.LedDataThis repeats oneByte 4 times to provide the data needed for one led. The first byte starts with 111xxxxx and a 5 bit brightness value on the place of the xxxxx. The brightness can be set from 0 to 31 (2^5 = 32 levels) .The next 3 bytes are for the blue, green and red values. One byte for each color.ColorWheelThisLedThis function calls ledData gives it the rgb colors depending on an angle in the color wheel. The 16 bit value is dividend in 6 equally spaced sections of 60 degrees. Looking at the images might help you understand better.(an 8 bit version is also provided but commented out because it's too flickery)StartEndFrameThe start frame needs to be used every time you want to send new colors to the leds and want to update the actual color of the ledsI only use the start frame because the endframe is not needed. The start frame is 4 bytes of 0. The end frame is 4 bytes of 255 (11111111).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FGN/0X8P/JKSZSDM9/FGN0X8PJKSZSDM9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1A/4R5C/JKSZSDK4/F1A4R5CJKSZSDK4.LARGE.jpg", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png"], "step_title": "Step 5: The Code (hardware Debounce)"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "After a while of playing I noticed some double tapping problems with the hardware debounce. This could be fixed with some other value resistors or capacitors, but as the buttons and lid are not removable I thought software debouncing would be a nice solution. The software debounce should work wether hardware debounce is implemented or not. In my current setup I coundn't remove the lid so i just left the resistors and capacitors in place. I won't explain the code as extensively as the previous version because it is a little harder to explain.Basically most of the code works the same and the led code is left untouched. what changed is the external interrupts don't use the arduino functions anymore. Now it works in pure C code. And now what's added is the software interrupt. For this i used the AVR timers to wait a certain amount of time until the bouncing has stopped. Because the timers are interrupt based the the decounce time is not influenced by anything happening in the loop.The only downside I can come up with is that the arduino delay functions can not be used anymore. Because delay functions use Timer 0 and this program uses Timer 0 to debounce.In the image you can see how the code roughly works. The mem bit indicates if a timer is running. What is not depicted is the case that at the end of the button press the input is low. In this case only a keypress would be send while the button is already released. Which means the key will be held down as far as the computer is concerned. For this rare exeption a check will be preformed when a timer expires.

It seems so simple! What's the problem?  Can I ever do it?The problem is reliability, consistency & robustness.  As mentioned, the current through an LED is very sensitive to small changes in the voltage across the LED, and also to the ambient temperature of the LED, and also to the manufacturing variances of the LED.  So when you just connect your LED to a battery you have little idea how much current is going through it. \"but so what, it lit up, didn't it?\". ok sure. depending on the battery, you might have way too much current (led gets very hot and burns out fast), or too little (led is dim).  the other problem is that even if the led is just right when you first connect it, if you take it to a new environment which is hotter or colder, it will either get dim or too bright and burn out, because the led is very temperature sensitive. manufacturing variations can also cause variability.So maybe you read all that, and you're thinking: \"so what!\".  if so, plow ahead and connect right to the battery.  for some applications it can be the way to go.- Summary: only use this for hacks, don't expect it to be reliable or consistent, and expect to burn out some LED's along the way.- One famous hack that puts this method to outstandingly good use is the LED Throwie.Notes:- if you are using a battery, this method will work best using *small* batteries, because a small battery acts like it has an internal resistor in it.  this is one of the reasons the LED Throwie works so well.- if you actually want to do this with a power-LED rather than a 3-cent LED, choose your battery voltage so that the LED will not be at full power.  this is the other reason the LED Throwie works so well.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 3: Direct Power!"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "This is by far the most widely used method to power LED's.

Q2 starts out turned on by R1.- Q1 (a small NPN) is used as an over-current sensing switch, and R3 is the \"sense resistor\" or \"set resistor\" that triggers Q1 when too much current is flowing.- The main current flow is through the LED's, through Q2, and through R3. When too much current flows through R3, Q1 will start to turn on, which starts turning off Q2. Turning off Q2 reduces the current through the LED's and R3. So we've created a \"feedback loop\", which continuously monitors the LED current and keeps it exactly at the set point at all times.  transistors are clever, huh!- R1 has high resistance, so that when Q1 starts turning on, it easily overpowers R1.- The result is that Q2 acts like a resistor, and its resistance is always perfectly set to keep the LED current correct.  Any excess power is burned in Q2.  Thus for maximum efficiency, we want to configure our LED string so that it is close to the power supply voltage.  It will work fine if we don't do this, we'll just waste power.  this is really the only downside of this circuit compared to a step-down switching regulator!setting the current!the value of R3 determines the set current.Calculations:- LED current is approximately equal to: 0.5 / R3- R3 power: the power dissipated by the resistor is approximately: 0.25 / R3.  choose a resistor value at least 2x the power calculated so the resistor does not get burning hot.so for 700mA LED current:R3 = 0.5 / 0.7 = 0.71 ohms.  closest standard resistor is 0.75 ohms.R3 power = 0.25 / 0.71 = 0.35 watts.  we'll need at least a 1/2 watt rated resistor.Parts used:R1: small (1/4 watt) approximately 100k-ohm resistor (such as: Yageo CFR-25JB series)R3: large (1 watt+) current set resistor.  (a good 2-watt choice is: Panasonic ERX-2SJR series)Q2: large (TO-220 package) N-channel logic-level FET (such as: Fairchild FQP50N06L)Q1: small (TO-92 package) NPN transistor (such as: Fairchild 2N5088BU)Maximum limits:the only real limit to the current source circuit is imposed by NFET Q2.  Q2 limits the circuit in two ways:1) power dissipation.  Q2 acts as a variable resistor, stepping down the voltage from the power supply to match the need of the LED's. so Q2 will need a heatsink if there is a high LED current or if the power source voltage is a lot higher than the LED string voltage.

Well, read on, and I'll try to help you out here. If you've never built a plastic model before, I recommend you build a few simple ones and get familiar with the basics before tackling a project like this.First Things First:Do not even think about lighting your model with tiny light bulbs. That's just SO 20th Century! Seriously, while LEDs are only a tiny bit more complex to use than light bulbs, the benefits are enormous:LEDs use a fraction of the power that equivalent bulbs use.     Because of the above, they generate almost no heat (at least in the small sizes).     They are available in gorgeous pure colors as well as white, without having to paint or dye them.     They can be easily dimmed without giving yellowish light as dimmed bulbs do.     They come in many more shapes and sizes than bulbs do, including so tiny you wouldn't believe it!     They also come in flashing and flickering types, without using any external components.", "title": "LED Lighting in Plastic Models", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/LED-Lighting-in-Plastic-Models/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I'm going to be using several models I've built with lights to illustrate this article. Most of the photos are of Pegasus's incredibly good Nautilus kit. (Sadly, this is not the Nautilus from the 1954 movie. Jules Verne never drew a picture, so this is as good an interpretation as many...) You want this model! The Martian War Machine (From the 1953 movie War of the Worlds) is another good Pegasus kit that begs to be lit up.Before you even pick up that Exacto Knife or cement bottle, you must decide a couple of things:Decide on a power source. The voltage of your power source will dictate some of your LED wiring, specifically, what resistors to use.I usually use a six or nine volt supply, using either 4 or 6 AA batteries, respectively. The supplier on the next page sells LEDs that already have the proper resistor for your power source.       Decide where you'll put the power source. I don't put the batteries inside the model, because that means you need a hatch in the model to get to the batteries, you'll also have to mount the switch on the model, and you'll have to handle the model every time you want to change batteries. I put the batteries and switch in a stand that the model is mounted to. For some models, such as cars, you might be able to put batteries and switch inside the model more easily.        Now that you've decided on a power source, shop for LEDs, especially if you're not familiar with their shapes and sizes. Decide where you're going to put them in your model, making sure there is enough interior room for wiring. (You may not be able to put wingtip lights on a plane, for instance, if the wings are too thin for the wires.) Decide whether the LED is going to be for area lighting, such as illuminating an interior (They'll need to be brighter for this), or spot lighting, meaning the LED is not intended to light something else. This may take some going back and forth, finding sizes and colors that will work for you, then figuring out if they'll fit.

The number and size depends on your model, and your abilities.They come in several brightnesses. If you want them very bright, specify \"Super Bright.\"Resistors, unless you're a beginner and you buy the LEDs with the resistors pre-installed. See sources, below.    A battery holder. The minimum is 2 batteries (3 Volts), but you can use any reasonable voltage, depending on how long you want the batteries to last and how much room you have for them. Rule of thumb: Bigger batteries or more batteries= Longer battery life.    A switch, unless you feel like taking out batteries every time you want to turn it off. You probably want one that will stay on when you turn it on, such as a toggle, rocker, or slide switch. This will again depend on your space, taste, and budget.    Wire. Regular 22 gauge hookup wire from Radio Shack will do fine. Having 2 colors (Red and Black is good) helps since LEDs do not work when backwards.    A cool model kit you want to light up.    Assorted drill bits, knives, and the like to carve holes in your model for the LEDs.    Small pliers, cutters, and other modeling tools.    Hot glue gun to keep things neat.    (Optional, depending on skills and taste): Epoxy, a stand for the model, headphone jack and plug, soldering tools and solder. If you need a primer on soldering, read the \"soldering comic.\" It's the best simplest basic instruction I've found so far.Parts Sources:Your parts sourcing will depend partly on how comfortable you are with electronics and LEDs. If you are inexperienced, you can get lots of prefabricated kits at http://www.modeltrainsoftware.com/ledlights1.html, including microscopically tiny LEDs that will fit virtually anywhere. I like these guys the best for their helpfulness to beginners. If you use their LEDs, you can get by without soldering. Just twist all the wires together and tape or glue them to make them stay put. You don't have to figure out resistors, they do all that for you. They also sell the switches, battery holders, connectors, AC power supplies, and complete kits. They have some great tutorials on their site. You will pay more money, though. You can get 10 or even 100 bare LEDs on eBay for what you'll pay for one LED here.And, of course, there's always Radio Shack. While they're not as good as they used to be, they still can be a handy (But expensive) source if you need a part Right Now.If you are comfortable working with LEDs and have, hopefully, a bit of soldering experience, buy your parts on eBay and save yourself lots of money.

You can skim most of this if you've bought the prefab ones from the previous step. I am assuming here that you already know how to solder. You will first need to decide what resistor is needed for the LEDs. This will depend on your battery voltage, and to a lesser extent, the type of LED. A good rule of thumb, if you don't feel like doing math, is 100 Ohms (Brown-black-brown) for 3 volts, 470 Ohms (Yellow-violet-brown) for 6 volts, and 1,000 Ohms (Brown-black-red) for 9 or 12 volts. These are very conservative values. If you want more details, and you understand the units, use the LED calculator here.LEDs are Polarized. This means that, unlike the switch and resistor, they care which way they are hooked up. The positive side of the LED has to be connected to the positive side of the battery, either through the resistor or the switch. If you wire one up backwards, it probably won't be damaged, but it also won't work. Study the first picture to see how to identify positive and negative. For other LEDs, the negative lead will always be the one marked in some fashion, either with a flat side, a notch, a dot, or something.Solder the chosen resistor to one leg of the LED. It helps to make a small hook in the lead of each component so they'll stay together long enough to solder. It doesn't matter which leg, as long as you know which is which. Make a habit of always putting the resistor on the same leg (positive or negative), so it's easier. You will also probably need to add wires to the LEDs. Use 2 different colors (the standard is red for positive, black for negative) so you can tell positive from negative.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSM/I0KS/I2XIECQB/FSMI0KSI2XIECQB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD6/HI4L/I2XIECYA/FD6HI4LI2XIECYA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW0/UT0J/I2XTQL8W/FW0UT0JI2XTQL8W.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Math? We Don't Need No Stinking Math!"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Now that you have a bunch of LED sub-assemblies, whether you bought them or made them, they need to be hooked up in parallel. Refer to the first picture. This means you gather all the positive leads together and twist  together, then all the negative leads likewise. These then get attached  to the battery and switch circuit. Positive to positive, negative to negative.I can't be too specific as far as mounting the LEDs goes; this will depend on your model and how elaborate you want to get. The first thing you want to do, though, is paint the entire interior of the model with a coat of black paint, preferably sprayed. Most of the  plastic used for models passes light, and having light shine through the skin of the model will ruin the effect. Black paint is the most opaque color. If needed, once you have a good coat of black paint on, you can put silver paint or foil in there to reflect the light and make it more even. You will need to make sure the wiring can be routed to the LEDs without being pinched, pulled, or otherwise molested. You may need to carve out channels for the wiring. A Dremel tool or sharp knife can help here. Depending on what you are lighting, you can either drill holes for the LEDs to mount from the backside, or just mount the LEDs inside with hot glue or epoxy. Test fit often to make sure you have clearance for the LEDs and wiring. On the models I've lighted, the LEDs are concealed behind clear parts, but if you're modeling something like, say, the red beacon on an old-style police car, sometimes you can just have the LED sticking out if it fits the scale of the model.Prepare your chosen stand with the battery holder and switch, extending wires as necessary to get the power to your model. I've had very good success using a stand with a 1/4\" or 1/8\" headphone jack in the model, and the matching plug on the stand. This serves as stand and power connector in one; the bonus is, since the plug is round, the model will swivel on the stand! Install the connector in the model, if you're using one. Use lots of epoxy if you're installing a jack, but be careful not to get epoxy on the electrical parts. If you're not going to use the plug-and-jack approach, determine where you're going to exit the wires from the model. Choose an inconspicuous spot and drill a hole just large enough for the wires to exit. They can be painted to match the model, or whatever color will make them blend in. Mask the wire ends, though, because electricity doesn't flow through paint, and you want to see your color code so you can hook it up correctly.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FHV/DKKB/I2XIE5J7/FHVDKKBI2XIE5J7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEL/1B95/I2XTRC23/FEL1B95I2XTRC23.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIT/4PG4/I2XIE59V/FIT4PG4I2XIE59V.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI6/NBAT/I2XTQRXE/FI6NBATI2XTQRXE.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Start Carving (The Model, Not the Turkey!)"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "I cannot stress enough the heartbreak you will experience if you do all this, glue your model together, and it doesn't work! So, test early and often.You must test as you go, both for fit, function, and light leaks. Keep a lithium battery or your chosen battery pack handy to test function. Test also the fit, not only of the LEDs and wiring, but the model parts themselves. If the parts do not fit together snugly, you will have light leaks at the seams. If you can't make a part fit tight enough to block light, it can be puttied and sanded, or use one of my favorite tricks: Mix up a small batch of 5-minute epoxy, and then mix in some black acrylic paint to make the epoxy opaque. Work this into the seam, then wipe off the excess with a cloth dampened with rubbing alcohol. Neither the alcohol nor the epoxy will harm the plastic, as long as you get the excess off before it sets.If you have any malfunctions, fix them now, before you go any further. This is the best reason to solder all connections... Soldered connections are much more reliable!Bonus tip: When you are comfortable with LEDs, you can also adjust the brightness to suit your application. The resistor values I gave earlier are a good starting point, but if you need some LEDs brighter and some dimmer, you can increase the resistor value to dim them as much as you want. If, on the other hand, they're not bright enough, you'll have to be cautious. Too much current will blow the LED. For most small LEDs, 20 milliamps is about all you want to push through them. The only alternative is buy brighter LEDs.

One system was built for our home and the other for our church.  Check out the videos of the systems in action!This is our living room LED system.This is the LED system we created for Island ECC in Hong Kong.You can discover our products at our web site: Brilldea.com", "title": "Controllable RGB LED System for Your Home or Office", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Controllable-RGB-LED-system-for-your-home-or-offic/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "All good RGB LED systems start with a bit of planning and forethought.  This step is crucial in determining your engineering requirements for the system, such as power supply size and number of control channels, as well as how much the system will cost.  And don't forget the artistic intent - planning will help you visualize the look of the system and how it will interact with your space.1.  First thing to figure out is the area where you want to add the LED lighting. You need to visualize where the LED system will be mounted and you should consider the LEDs, the controller(s), the power supply and related cables.  The most important aspect of this step is to determine the area the LEDs will illuminate.  Do you have a cove where you want to place the lighting?  Can you rearrange furniture to make a gap for LEDs?  Are you remodelling where you can plan a special place for your LEDs and associated hardware to be embedded in a wall or the floor?Our living room system was built in between our Ikea book cases.  The Island ECC system was designed while the room was being constructed so a special space was carved out for it such that the lights fit right within the walls.2. Once you have an area picked out, the next thing to consider is how many LEDs you want to use to cover that area.  There are several variables to consider.  Will the LEDs project onto a translucent surface?  Will the LEDs be viewed directly?  How deep is the space where the LEDS are mounted?  How translucent is your material that is being projected on?  Do you want to illuminate shapes and patterns in the LED array?  How bright do you want the light to be?You will need to consider the size of each \"pixel\" in the system.  For our systems we used our RGB LED Ribbon.  This is a 10cm flexible printed circuit board with 3 RGB LEDs on it.  The LEDs are wired in series so each strip operates on 12V DC.  The LEDs are controlled as a group.Each system we designed had different depths and different translucent material to project on.  Your spacing and size will vary based on your location and budget.  We used both a milky plexiglass and a corugated white plastic.Our living room LED system used 32 pieces of the 10cm RGB LED Ribbon, 16 in each column.  The Island ECC system used 48 pieces in each \"window\" and there were three windows.3.  Once you have determined the quantity of LEDs to install, then you can start planning the number of control channels for the system, the current for your power supply and the distribution of the wiring.The following video shows the setup and testing of the Island ECC system.  The video include notes on the components and it shows off the test routines used during assembly and installation.

Let's take a moment to review those components.1.  The LED system needs a brain to control all those LEDs.  This brain is usually a microcontroller such as the Parallax Propeller or SX or PIC or Arduino.  This controller may cycle the LEDs using preprogrammed algorithms or change the LEDs based on an external connection to a DMX-512A system or serial (RS-232).  We designed the Prop Blade controller for our specific applications of LED systems.  The Prop Blade accepts 6V to 12V DC and has connections for both serial (via the programming header) and DMX-512A.  In addition it has status LEDs for feedback and DIP switches and buttons for user input.  You can get the Prop Blade as a kit from Brilldea if you want to use this controller.  You are also welcome to make your own.2.  One or more LED driver modules is needed to control all the LEDs, after all a microcontroller only has so many I/O pins.  To control this many LEDs, the microcontroller needs help so we designed the LED Painter.  The LED Painter can control 16 channels of RGB LEDs.  This means that we can hook up 16 pieces of RGB LED Ribbon, one to each channel, and control the color and intensity of each ribbon.  The LED Painter is based on the TLC5940 IC from Texas Instruments.  There is code available online for both the Propeller and Arduino for controlling this IC.  You can also get LED Painter kits from Brilldea.3. And of course, every LED system needs...well...umm...LEDs!  That is right, lots of red, green, blue LEDs!  We like the convenience of the RGB LED Ribbon we sell. The back side of the product has an adhesive on it so it mounts easily to surfaces.  The LEDs and resistors are already assembled and it runs on 12V DC.  Furthermore it can be flexed to mount on curved surfaces if needed.  If you want, you could use your own LEDs.  You don't even have to use RGB LEDs, you could attach 48 single color LEDs or 24 of one color and 24 of another color.  Check out the LED Painter data sheet for more details.4.  All the equipment in the system would be for nothing if you didn't supply power.  Yes, all these components need DC power.  Our systems are designed to run on 12V DC.  The quantity of LEDs in your system will dictate the amount of current your supply will need to provide.  We used 12V DC, 5 amp supplies for our install and had plenty of room left over for expansion.  If you want to be more precise, you will need to calculate the current draw of the LEDs you use in your system as well as the current needed for your controller and drivers.5.  Here are a few more items that complete the system:Cable and wire for distributing power and control signals.A computer and programming hardware for your controller.  If you are using the Prop Blade which is based on the Parallax Propeller, you will want to purchase a Prop Plug from Parallax.Electronic and hand tools for assembling your system such as soldering iron, pliers, screw drivers, cutting tools and wire strippers.Any mounting hardware needed for mounting your controller, drivers, power supply, etc.A DMX-512A source, if you want to use DMX to control your LED system; this is optional.6. Now that you have thought about the shape, space, size and look of your system, as well as considered the materials required, you can start pricing it.  Your system cost will vary based on its size and what materials you may already have from past projects.  If you have a microcontroller sitting around, then you might be able to use that.  Remember to price the system out and to set realistic costs for the \"non-trivial\" items like connectors, ribbon cables, and AC cords because those costs can add up.The following video shows an overview of our home LED system.  This system was our first one created, so the hardware used in the system is a first revision.  Brilldea's current Prop Blade and LED Painter are updated designs needed to accomplish a similar system.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FAV/4PXN/FMMD5FE6/FAV4PXNFMMD5FE6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKR/ZRTY/FMMD5FE8/FKRZRTYFMMD5FE8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTG/8W3E/FMMD5FE7/FTG8W3EFMMD5FE7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPF/78S8/FMMD5FE5/FPF78S8FMMD5FE5.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: LED System Components"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "By the time you reach this step, you should have completed your design and purchased all your parts.  I love receiving boxes of parts to make my great ideas into reality, how about you?  Nothing beats putting your hands to work building the design that you crafted in the previous steps.  When I assemble a system, I take my time to double check my construction.  I double check components before populating a PCB, I double check connections that are soldered or terminated such as data cables, and I test the system at increments as I go along.  With a large RGB LED system there are many things that can go wrong, so testing as you go along is a good idea.  This technique will help you identify problems before they become bigger problems and damage other components.  For instance, we tested the Prop Blade controller before we attached it to the LED Painter driver PCB.  When you start constructing your system, the first thing you should do is assemble your controller and LED driver circuits.  If you are using a kit like one of ours, great, then the procurement of parts was easy and assembly shouldn't take too long.  If you are building your own controller and LED driver this step may take more time.  Don't worry though because the effort is worth it when you get the controller of your system working.  When assembling a kit, you should print out the schematic and bill of materials to make sure you use the right components and place the component in the right spot.When you finish assembling your controller, take the time to power it on and test it.  Download a simple program to the controller to verify that the controller works.  In our case, we used the Parallax Prop Plug to download software to the Prop Blade.Once you finish a driver board, power it on to make sure nothing explodes.  Once you've passed that test, add a single RBG LED to a channel and attach the driver to your controller.  Use a simple program to verify that the controller can control the driver/RGB LED setup.  Again, for the Prop Blade and LED Painter we have example programs on our site: Brilldea.com.Now that you have the electronics done, let's move on to the LEDs!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FGF/09V6/FMMD5FGA/FGF09V6FMMD5FGA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFK/KIWR/FMMD5FG7/FFKKIWRFMMD5FG7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVJ/EZOQ/FMMD5FG8/FVJEZOQFMMD5FG8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM6/48AW/FMMD5FG9/FM648AWFMMD5FG9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZI/AE67/FMMD5FGB/FZIAE67FMMD5FGB.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Construction Time!"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "The most tedious part of an RGB LED array is the LED construction and connections.  This step usually involves lots of wire cutting, striping, crimping, and soldering.  Not to mention the double checking of each connection to make sure it was done right.  If you find ways to improve this process, let us know in the comments.Again, this step takes time.  Plan the debut of your system accordingly so you don't have to rush at the last minute to finish all the work that needs to be done.  Staying up all night to create your master piece will result in damaging your components because of miswiring.  Take your time and double check connections.Our systems were designed in modules so we could easily assemble the system on site.  The systems were also easier to test as we assembled them.  For instance, the LEDs for the Island ECC system were assembled on panels that were 1 meter long by 0.4 meters tall. Each panel was identical so we made a pattern for where to mount the LEDs, how to route the wires and where to place the LED Painter.   This step is pretty easy technically, just repetitive and time consuming.  If you use the RGB LED Ribbon then you can mount the LEDs to a surface by removing the covering over the adhesive backing.  Make sure to mount the LEDs to a clean surface.  Add wires, connectors and harnesses as required.  We like to have connectors in case we need to remove a piece of equipment for inspection or replacement.  You may choose to solder all the connections and forego the expense and time required to add connectors.  Once the LEDs are ready, plug them into your LED Driver circuit or LED Painter assembly and test.  You might want to plug each LED channel in one at a time rather than all of them at once.If you assemble the system in modules, then you will have to install each module in its final location.  When you install them, be sure to power them on one at a time.  Again, checking your connections before you power them on.As mentioned in the other steps, our systems use the Prop Blade.  The Prop Blade has two groups of I/O.  Each I/O group can run up to two LED Painters in a series, so that is four LED Painters for one controller.  More could be run, but you need to pay attention to details of wire length and signals strength, and we have found that buffering circuits should be built to increase reliability.  Be aware that the LED Painter needs to be close to the Prop Blade controller.  Installing an LED Painter 20ft from your controller that uses 3.3V DC logic signals will produce poor results or no results at all.  Consider your mounting locations carefully.Once you get the LEDs installed you are nearly there.  At this point you have no doubt done some power-on test and felt the excitement of the system coming alive!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FVD/674O/FMMCYIHI/FVD674OFMMCYIHI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP6/8VSK/FMMCYIFW/FP68VSKFMMCYIFW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7H/GF8H/FMMD5FJY/F7HGF8HFMMD5FJY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV1/78EV/FMMD5FK2/FV178EVFMMD5FK2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F89/UMKG/FMMD5FK3/F89UMKGFMMD5FK3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC4/9IOD/FMMD5FK1/FC49IODFMMD5FK1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1F/YH8Y/FMMD5FK0/F1FYH8YFMMD5FK0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7T/UG0H/FMMD5FJZ/F7TUG0HFMMD5FJZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: LED Assembly"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Once we get the system installed we sit back and enjoy it.  Well, maybe not yet.  Of course, there are problems that come up along the way while building and installing the system so by this point you may have to do some troubleshooting.  Hopefully the major problems were discovered in the incremental testing done during the construction.  By the time the whole system is up, usually everything is in working order.At this step you can finalize the mounting and wiring of components and make everything tidy.  You can also tweak (or start writing!) your control software.  Writing the software is a lot of fun, especially when you get to the higher level software that describes what the LEDs look like.  I call those routines the \"painting\" routines.Previously I mentioned that you can control your system through different means.  Some people just want to turn the system on and let it cycle by itself.  In this type of system there should be preprogrammed routines or algorithms to fade, wipe or place random colors on the screen.Demo code for the Prop Blade and LED Painter can be found on the Parallax Propeller Object Exchange or the Brilldea web site.  The example code shows simple algorithms for fading and changing color.Other people are control freaks!  They want to control every pixel and every color in precise synchronization.  The LED Painter and Prop Blade combo allows for DMX-512A control(like RS-485) or serial control (through the Prop plug). This means you can use software on your PC such as Vixen Lights to design a show with light and music synchronization.  With the LED Painter, each control channel can be controlled from off to on in 255 steps.  This allows for mixing of colors at various intensities.Other things you could do with your LED system:Make it detect the beat of a song and change the look based on that.  This would entail adding a microphone to your system and processing the input.Make it detect video and change the look based on that, sort of like Ambilight on Philips flat screen TVs.  This may involve adding a computer that streams video to your TV or adding a web cam to capture your TV image.Make it turn on and off automatically at certain times.  This could be based on day light, time of day, or detecting some one is in the room or close to the system.Make it controlled over the Internet so the world can turn on and off the LEDs in your living room.Connect the LED wall to your mood ring so the LED wall can reflect your mood!We hope you enjoyed this Instructable.

In my design, the control circuit\u00a0connects the battery to\u00a0an inverter and an\u00a0output circuit\u00a0when the battery is fully charged. Here is a brief description of how the circuit works. A 5V voltage regulator powers the 555 timer IC and sets its internal reference voltages. A pair of potentiometers (variable resistors) are set up as voltage dividers that provide a signal to the timer IC that is proportional to the battery's voltage. These signals\u00a0determine the operating range of the system. As the battery's voltage rises and falls, so does the output signals of the potentiometers. When the signal at pin 6 rises above 3.3V, the output of the IC goes LOW and activates the relay through a series of transistors. When the signal at pin 2 falls below 1.6V, the output of the IC goes HIGH,\u00a0which deactivates the relay. By setting the positions of the\u00a0potentiometers, you determine at what voltages the battery must be to activate and deactivate the output.Alternate Design with Charge Controller A charge controller usually\u00a0isn't required for this setup. If the output of your solar panel is small relative to the storage capacity of your battery and you are powering a device that is frequently turned on, then\u00a0you generally\u00a0don't need to be worried about over charging the battery. However, if you wish to use a charge controller, you may attach one between the solar panel and the control circuit. I have also provided an alternate circuit design\u00a0that includes a charge controller built into the control circuit.

Most human beings are dependent on electricity for their daily needs such as Charging their Smart Phones, Powering their houses or even their cars, etc. Most of the electricity we use in our houses are consumed by Air Conditioners, Lighting, Water Heating, etc. According to a study conducted by the World FactBook, the world consumes 19,320,360,620 MWh/yr. China, U.S., E.U*, India, Russia are some top consumers of electricity. A majority of the top consuming countries are developing economies like India, Brazil, Taiwan, etc. Coal is one of the main resources of producing electricity. But due to its high demand, shortages it increases the cost of producing electricity. Around 18% of the electricity produced by the world is consumed by the Residential Sector.Solar & Wind EnergyOne of the simplest solutions of reducing the dependence of Human beings directly on Electricity and Indirectly on Non-Renewable sources of energy is to switch too Renewable resources of Energy. The most viable and easily available Renewable sources of energy are Solar & Wind energy. Solar & Wind energy can be easily harnessed with the help of Solar Panels and Windmills.The Solar + Wind Powered HouseThe Solar + Wind powered house is a simple and aesthetically good looking design for Houses or homes that wish to run on Renewable Energy.The Solar + Wind powered house that I had built was set up in a rural agriculture dependent part of India.This house served two purposes: \u2022 It provided a cost effective solution to my housing and electricity needs by consuming renewable resources of energy.   \u2022 The Solar and Wind energy was also used for the purpose of Irrigation.The surplus energy produced by this house is perfect for applications like irrigation in Electricity Deficient countries like India. This system completely isolates and safeguards its user from Poor service, Power fluctuations ( which can cause damage to appliances), High prices, Blackouts etc.The applications and benefits of this house are not only limited too Rural or Energy Deficient countries. This house can also be constructed in those countries which are not energy deficient for the purpose of a Green and a Sustainable way of Living.\u2022 This Instructable teaches you how to Build and Construct a Solar+Wind Powered House.   \u2022 It also will help those who have an existing house or structure to setup a Solar or Wind powered House.The Windmill DesignThe windmill used in this house is not your typical windmill. Generally windmills have just one set of blades. In this windmill there are 2 sets of blades. The technology is called Front-set Double Flying Birds. the first set of blades consists of 3 larger(in length) blades. While the second set consists of 9 smaller size blades. The smaller set of blades start producing electricity at a wind speed of only 1.8m/s(Highly efficient). It also starts to rotate the larger set of blades which then gain momentum. In this way the windmill or wind turbine used is capable of producing electricity even at low wind speeds.KitchenThe kitchen stove isn't a typical gas cooktop. It actually is an Induction stove which means that it doesn't run on gas (propane,LPG). Instead it runs on electricity which is harvested from the Sun by the solar panels.

Level the site and digs the holes and trenches for the foundation and the septic tanks.The Foundation of this structure was built using a method called 'Plum Concreting'. Plum Concreting also known as Cyclopean Concreting, this is a variety of Concreting consisting of large sized stones(Plums) with interstices filled with concrete. This method of Concreting provides a Stable foundation. This method of concreting is also used while laying foundations upon uneven surfaces. Plum concreting helps in reducing the cost of the overall construction. While carrying out the process of Plum Concreting it is important too ensure that concrete is thoroughly mixed and that their are no air pockets created in the foundation. Once the process of laying the foundation is complete, the concrete will need time to cure. During this period, there will be no activity on the construction site.I have constructed the foundation of the house so that the top most point of the foundation is approximately 6-10ft above ground level. This increases the overall height of the house. This increase in height could lead to higher wind speeds at the higher levels of the house which would increase the windmill/turbine speed. Base Specification: 36ft X 23ft = 828sq.ft.CAUTION: For people that live in a temperate zone (i.e., subject to frost and freezing), you must ensure that the foundation of the house extends below the frost depth. This should prevent the damage caused to the structure by frost heaving. Also make sure that the water pipes are buried below the frost line, or insulated to prevent them from freezing.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F9V/4UNY/I2P3OO4N/F9V4UNYI2P3OO4N.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Laying of Foundation "}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "The Metal Framework of the house is what holds the house together. It consists of a number of I- beams, C- channels, Base plates etc. These parts are either wielded or bolted together. Together these parts form the essential skeleton of the house. Since these parts are generally made out of metal (generally iron), they do get affected by moisture and hence get corroded. Hence it is essential to protect these parts by painting an anti-corrosion paint on them. The foundation, floors, walls, roof, etc are all held together by the metal framework. Hence it is necessary to construct the metal framework accurately so that it can bear the load of the house properly. LayoutI have also attached a whole lot of images of the entire structure. These image layout plans were designed too depict the construction in a more 3D based method. This is the first time I have used such a type of program (Google Sketchup) to generate house plans. Because of my lack of experience using this software, there may be some design faults. However the plan images are pretty accurate and well detailed.

It will also show you how to assemble, size and calculate individual solar systems.Follow the block diagram while making the connections.   The Red wires are Positive, Black are Negative. The Red wire between the Inverter-CB-Power Consumption Meter-Load is Live, Black is Neutral and Green is Ground or Earthing.  Be Careful while making connections.   Do not switch anything ON while connecting all the parts and components.   Do not interchange the polarity and stick to the colour coding of the wires- Red, Black & Green.   Cut all the wires to length using the wire cutter and strip the PVC covering of the ends of the wire using the wire stripper.  Start by connecting the output terminals of the windmill to the input terminals of the Circuit Breaker (CB).The output terminals of that CB must be connected to the 'Wind Input' terminals of the Hybrid Controller.   Next connect the output terminals of the Solar Panel Array to the input terminals of another CB.   Connect the output terminals of that CB to the input terminals of the Charge Controller (CC).Connect the output terminals of the CC to the 'Solar Input' terminals of the Hybrid Controller.   The connect the output terminals of the Hybrid Controller to the terminals Battery Array.   Also Connect the the same terminals of the Battery Array to the input terminals of yet another CB.   Connect the output of that CB to the input DC terminals of the Inverter.   Connect the output terminals of the Inverter to the input terminals of yet another CB.   Connect the output terminals of that CB to the input terminals Power Consumption Meter (KWh Meter).   Connect the output terminals of the Power Consumption meter to the Load.WindmillThe Windmill is a device that converts Wind energy into Electricity. The blades of the windmill turn by the force of the wind. This then turns the shaft of the generator. Due to magnetic induction created in the generator part of the windmill electricity is produced.Solar Panel ArrayThe Solar Panel is the device which converts the light emitted by the Sun into electrical energy. When the suns rays fall onto the solar cells, the electrons in the solar cells get excited and begin to flow, thus producing electrical energy.The diodes in the Solar Panel Connection Box are used to maintain the polarity of the solar panel. If the positive wire is connected in the middle terminal, the voltage is halved.Circuit Breaker (CB)The Circuit Breaker is a kind of Switch which switches OFF/shuts down/shuts OFF when a certain amount of current passes through it. It will shut OFF only when the current exceeds the given specified amount. E.g: 15A etc. It also shuts OFF when theres a short circuit. The reason one MUST connect the Circuit Breaker between different parts/appliances is to prevent the damage caused by lightning strikes, short circuits,etc. Lightning can cause the battery to explode and also damage the entire system. The Circuit Breaker immediately shuts OFF when lightning strikes the Solar Panel or Windmill.Charge Controller (CC)The Charge Controller is a device that regulates the voltage and current of the solar array. It gives a steady output which used by the hybrid controller.Hybrid ControllerThe hybrid controller electronically combines and controls the Voltage and Current supplied by the Solar Panel Array and the Windmill. It regulates the voltage and makes suitable for charging the battery array.Battery ArrayThe Battery is a device which stores the electrical energy in the form of chemical energy. A Lead Acid battery contains lead acid in it. As the battery is used it releases hydrogen gas.Inverter/ UPSThe Inverter/UPS is an electronic device which converts a low voltage DC input into a high voltage AC output. E.g: An inverter can convert 12VDC (from battery) into 220VAC (to appliance). An inverter is necessary if your appliances run on 220V AC.Power Consumption MeterThe power consumption meter measure the running total of the amount of power-hours that have been consumed by the appliances. It is measured in Kilo Watt Hours (KWh).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F14/1WPI/I301MBQC/F141WPII301MBQC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG6/8535/I34E04JS/FG68535I34E04JS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPD/FF5L/I301M4K2/FPDFF5LI301M4K2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F25/JXI1/HWE9TDBD/F25JXI1HWE9TDBD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F09/L2PU/I301M4IU/F09L2PUI301M4IU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKL/GF0X/I301M4HZ/FKLGF0XI301M4HZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ3/RL0Y/I301M4IY/FZ3RL0YI301M4IY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2X/BK4D/I301M4IL/F2XBK4DI301M4IL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB1/UNIY/I301M4HI/FB1UNIYI301M4HI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNZ/LOPE/HWE9TDI2/FNZLOPEHWE9TDI2.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 23: Solar+Wind Block Diagram & Connections"}, {"step": 24, "steps_text": "The sizing of the Solar Panels, Windmill, Batteries, Charge and Hybrid controllers all depend on the desired load.The charge controller, hybrid controller, batteries should all be compatible and also fit their respective parameters.A detailed guide to the Sizing of the Solar Panels: Apartment Solar System.The windmill/ Wind turbine can also add the additional power required to the system.Both together should be enough to charge the batteries and should not exceed the maximum input values of the Hybrid Control System.The inverter should also be compatible with the output of the battery array.

You can use scissors or wire cutters to cut them.Next, use some superglue under every LED and glue them on the grid we drawed in previous step (where the lines intersect). Pay attention to the arrows on the LED's - they need to be orientated the same way in that row.

Get your thin solid core copper wire (in my case I used UPT wires) and start soldering all the horizontal LEDs  by connecting GND -> GND, DO (data out) -> DI (data in), 5V -> 5V. When you come to the end of the row, simply connect the last (DO) to the (DI) on the LED that is bellow in the next row.Now we will drill some vetical holes in the center so we will bring power to the LEDs.

That will be our front-board.Now we need to make the borders that will hold the front and the back board together. This will be done out of 3mm black acrylic. In my case, I didn't have any acrylic at home so I got the borders from a company and they've laser cut them to match my size. If you don't have such a company/laser available you will have to get the acrylic and cut out the pieces by hand. You need to have two 66,3cm and two 32,3cm long pieces, both 3,8cm wide.At the ends you need to make grooved cuts so that the borders will sit nicely together. On the long two borders you need to make a 10mm groove in the center and on the short two you need to make a 10mm tab at the center. You make the tab by cuting two grooves at the opposite sides where you created a groove on the long border. Again, you have the Borders.pdf for more instructions.You now need to drill a few holes for screwing  the borders on the back-plate later. Drill 3mm holes 5mm from the end (so that the screw will then go in the center of the backboard). Drill 3 holes on the short borders and 4 holes on the long ones.

The power inverter has a fan so the box needed to be designed to allow for adequate airflow. The internal frame was designed to have two levels. The lower portion contains the fan and power inverter. The top contains the relay board, battery charger module and power button sub-board for the inverter. The air gets sucked in from the front. Then it does a 180 degree turn to the upper level and then out the top vent holes. See the side view diagram for details.  First, fabricate the lower base plate. It should be sized so that it fits inside the bottom of the ammo box. The material used is scrap pegboard. A jigsaw is used to cut it out. Cut out some smaller pieces of pegboard and use them to block in the power inverter board. Position, then glue these smaller pieces to the larger piece. Allow room for the battery. See photos for more details.  Next, fabricate the four legs. The legs are used to hold the top plate. The legs are made from strips of aluminum sheet. Using metal snips, cut out two long strips. These are roughly 3/4 in. wide by 10 in. long. Bend these in a \u201cU\u201d shape and epoxy them to the lower base plate. Wait a day for the epoxy to dry. When dry, bend the ends of the four legs inward. Drill holes in each of these ends. Then thread bolts into these holes. The four bolts should be pointing upwards. Epoxy these bolts in place from the underside. See the side view diagram.The 12V car accessory (cigarette lighter) jack comes with a \u201cL\u201d shaped metal bracket. Use this metal bracket as an upper support for the top plate. Just drill the end of the metal bracket and epoxy a bolt to it, similar to the support legs fabrication. See the photo for details. Solder a crimp lug to the bracket. This provides the negative power to the 12V car accessory jack. The top plate should sit on top of this bracket.  The top plate is made from 1/8 inch acrylic sheet. It was heated and bent to form a \u201cZ\u201d shape. First create a template in cardboard. The top level of the \u201cZ\u201d should be above the fan but below the DC power jack, switch, USB connector and vent holes. See the photos for details.Transfer that template to the acrylic sheet and cut it out with a jigsaw. Using a metal brake and a heat gun, bend the acrylic to the desired \u201cZ\u201d shape. Next drill 5 holes that align with the bolts that were epoxied to the legs.  Fabricate a small mounting board for the inverter sub-board that holds the power switch. Use sheet ABS and screw the sub-board into it. Drill two holes in the ABS that align with the epoxied bolts on two of the legs.  Lastly, position the battery on the lower base plate. Create a slot in the plate so that the nylon web strap can be used to strap the battery to the lower base plate.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FX3/OEWY/HUMTMFT7/FX3OEWYHUMTMFT7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMP/PKF0/HUMTMCKM/FMPPKF0HUMTMCKM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL4/B7UZ/HUMTMCKS/FL4B7UZHUMTMCKS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVI/6BK1/HUMTMCKU/FVI6BK1HUMTMCKU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNT/HAXB/HUMTMCKV/FNTHAXBHUMTMCKV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHL/2AXP/HUMTMCKZ/FHL2AXPHUMTMCKZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGW/S16K/HUMTMCNP/FGWS16KHUMTMCNP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ2/7ED7/HUMTMCMC/FZ27ED7HUMTMCMC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ0/5S0U/HUMTMCP3/FJ05S0UHUMTMCP3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAJ/UGIW/HUMTMCL2/FAJUGIWHUMTMCL2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQH/66B0/HUMTMCM1/FQH66B0HUMTMCM1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9M/UO2F/HUMTMCPH/F9MUO2FHUMTMCPH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBL/L9LK/HUMTMCQ4/FBLL9LKHUMTMCQ4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1G/K0VR/HUMTMCQH/F1GK0VRHUMTMCQH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDJ/LN53/HUMTMCO2/FDJLN53HUMTMCO2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3T/V8F9/HUMTMCM7/F3TV8F9HUMTMCM7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5L/G2IR/HUMTMCN2/F5LG2IRHUMTMCN2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO1/UD7N/HUMTMCND/FO1UD7NHUMTMCND.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Fabricate Internal Frame"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "  The relay board is used to turn on the lamp if the power mains goes down.

When the power mains goes down, the relay coil de-energizes which flips the lamp on.  Unfortunately, the output of the charger wall wart is AC so it must first be converted to DC. The relay coil works only with DC, hence the need for the relay board.  The construction of the relay board is simple. It consists of a diode bridge and 7812 voltage regulator.

This project follows along in the footsteps too. I have made smaller clocks before, but nothing of the scale of a typical wall clock. This is due mainly to the high price of fabricating one off large PCBs.  I wanted to create something large, not too big. I also wanted to keep the cost down. I managed to solve these problems by making various design choices, which will be covered in detail in the following steps.I got some initial inspiration from adafruits 12 pixel neopixel ring, and now I notice that they sell a 60 pixel version which wasn't available back when I designed this, but comes as 4 segments to create a full ring. This would be an easy way to create a similar clock, without the need for making PCBs and soldering LEDs and small SMD parts.  I showed my design off over at the 43oh forums at the first prototype, the users there are great. They offered hints and design advice, aswell as helping source cheaper LEDs and PCBs, by buying in bulk via a group buy. If you have a projects that you are working on you should think about taking the time to display it somewhere online. Another great reason, since writing is a creative process, it can definitely help you process ideas and thoughts if you ever get stuck on a project.Please note, I am writing this more as a project log rather than a tutorial, Basically because I will only make one of these following the steps outlined here exactly, and I know that if I make it again it will be different, and different again after that.

Prototyping with boards that large is much more expensive than small 5cm squared boards. Not to mention that I would have paid for 5 pieces, and would only be using 1. The solution was to create a small arched segment, that would be identical, and could be daisy-chained together. Initial designs involved a data/clock/latch/power data connection between boards. each board would then need a serial shift register and some driving electronics to drive the LEDs, this solution would work perfectly fine, except it would only provide a binary output to the LEDs. I wanted more than colours. Moving on to another thought, LED drivers. This would have basically been a similar electronics setup to the equinox clock. Which I actually took some inspiration from.

Because they only need power and a single data pin, the PCB design becomes very simple. Infact most of the PCB is a filled power plane, that is used to help dissipate any heat generated. The fact that the back of the PCB is bare is very useful for the next step.One thing to note about these LEDs, they are very smart. 24 bit colour control, internal current limiting, buffering and reshaping of signal, daisy-chainable. But they are not smart enough to display a clock face, or even to light up the colour that you want them to be without some kind of controller that is speaking a language they understand.A quick search for \"WS2812 code\" will probably turn up results for your favorite platform.

I chose the MSP430G2553, for it's decent program memory/ram (8kb/512b), it's 28 pin count, and it's relatively small and easy to solder TSSOP form factor.Almost all the pins are used, I wanted to make this controller a bit more special. So a 12 point touch slider has been fabricated into the edge of the board. It was envisioned that this would act somewhat like a 1d touchpad, as input into the device. like a computer mouse scroll wheel, before they added a middle button, and prev/next switches if you pushed the wheel.3 other pins are used to interface to a I2C accelerometer, because why not? another pair of pins connects to a 32khz watch crystal for adequate time keeping, this is a clock after all. finally a single pin is used to interface to all 120 LED pixels.The whole controller fits onto the back of one of the segment, with no disturbance of the LEDs above it, meaning from the front, the only difference between the two segments is a small amount extra traces between the LEDs, and a tiny programming connection, the mounting hole, and daisy connections are identical.The videos show off the capacitive touch pads embedded in the controller, and a quick demo of the accelerometer.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F53/WGOK/HUBAQS9W/F53WGOKHUBAQS9W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVJ/O68B/HUB88JEK/FVJO68BHUB88JEK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Controller"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "At this point I have a very nice looking ring, it is covered in bright, colorful, pretty, RGB LEDS. but it still has wires running off to power it, and it's still very fragile.I never like packing my projects into black plastic ABS boxes, I actually prefer to see the PCB, but that's not wise for something that you want to keep working for a long time. I had a crazy idea to encase the whole ring in clear resin. There were a few problems with this, I had NEVER touched casting resin before. So I went to my local hardware, bought a tin of clear resin, and experimented.I can't remember where or when, but I recalled that Vaseline can be used to stop resin sticking to surfaces. I still don't know if this is true, but I used it anyway.This is how the experiment played out (following along with the pictures)Cut out some wood segments, coat in a thin layer of vasoline   Clamp up the wood to create a cube mold, my final ring would have a cross section about this size.   Get resin supplies, read instructions, twice.   Put on gloves, resin is nasty stuff so go outside.   Mix up according to instructions.   Pour into mold, for this test I suspended a single WS2812 led inside. (notice my mold leaked. u_u)   after 24 hours of curing, I extracted my completed cube.

I decided to do mine just a little differently. I created my jig slightly different, in my setup the router stays in the one place, and my workpiece is rotatedNotice how everything is marked, I tried to be as symmetric as I could when cutting my mounting holes, but they aren't symmetric, so the mold needs to be put back the same orientation for a perfect circle. It is also a very good practice to label and date everything.

Since I can't just take it out of the resin once it's gone in, I need a method for talking to the micro controller. I was thinking a few different ideas, wireless, IR, inductive coils. Then one of my friends slapped me and told me KISS, \"Keep It Simple Stupid\"Since I already have a small debug connector (4 pins), I decided to stay with that, I just needed to solder on a connector that will end up flush against the edge of the resin. This has to be sealed, so that resin won't fill the pins, this small one is already sealed from the rear, so all I needed to do was place a carefully cut label over the connector holes. Secondly the ring needs power, so again I went for simplicity and used 2 threaded solder in standoffs in the board. these will carry the 5 volts and ground to power the ring.These 3 extrusions from the board are evenly spaced as to provide a stable raised support. I wanted to have the LEDs facing upwards in the mold because I feared that more bubbles would be lodged under them than the bare rear PCB. Now its time to pour the resin.Pouring a layer of resin just over half the height, then placing the ring in and slowly twisting it while pushing down will reduce the bubbles trapped underneath. Another layer is poured over the top of the LEDs slowly, ensuring no excess bubbles are formed, bubbles in the resin will float to the top and pop with time. Once the resin is poured a needle can be used to poke at the PCB and ensure it is centered in the mold.One thing I noticed at this point was that the mold was closer to a perfect circle than the ring was :/ Leave this for 24 hours to set.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSB/D68I/HUB88JDW/FSBD68IHUB88JDW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH2/5B43/HUBARAEC/FH25B43HUBARAEC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG8/KZPR/HUBARAFL/FG8KZPRHUBARAFL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3E/7SLS/HUB88JE5/F3E7SLSHUB88JE5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQR/3RO3/HUB6KM6X/FQR3RO3HUB6KM6X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FT8/CKDC/HUB6KM6V/FT8CKDCHUB6KM6V.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Setting the Ring"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "After 24 hours I went to check on the mold.

I promptly moved the entire mold out into the sun, I must have knocked it because I came to check on it after an hour and the resin had started to pour out the two corners I had left without bolts. Everything was going wrong, I promptly added the two bolts that I had left off thinking that 2 would be enough. I tilted the mold a bit too much adding the second bolt, resin pored up over the edge and down one side of my mold. I am grateful that I didn't discard the excess resin that I had mixed up.

The resin had probably seeped into the wood grain by now, I'm using MDF sheets for the mold, so that's a likely outcome.Using the jig I had designed for routing out circles. I marked where the edge of the ring was. Found appropriate distances to route at. Then I checked these back with the ring. Making a mistake here could result in LEDs being routed in half and a very non-functional timepiece.I decided it would be a good idea to remove the bottom half of the mold. The tracing paper I used between layers worked very well to keep the resin from the wood. But wasn't exactly flush with the bottom wood layer, so the surface wasn't flat as I had hoped. Ohh and there was an air bubble.I poked at the surface and noticed that it hadn't fully set yet. perfect. Using an exacto knife the resin was cut out above the bubble. I mixed up a small batch of resin, this time making sure to use plenty of the catalyst. I filled the hole, and traveled around the ring covering the whole back with an extra 2mm. My plan was to sand this down back to a perfectly flat surface.I used the router to try to get the surface flat, this is called facing off a surface I believe. Unfortunately the jig I was using for the circles wasn't very good at keeping the working material a fixed distance from the router, so I resorted to my coarsest sand paper, P160. I'm using wet and dry sand paper, with water. this is recommended for resin ans the particles clog up the sand paper otherwise. Be prepared to use alot of elbow grease if you are repeating this.My suspicions were correct when I started milling around the ring. The wood had a darker patch an extra 1-2mm around the circumference. So it is essential to mill out the ring from the wood. Milling was done is small increments, around 3mm of depth each pass.Once free from the resin mold you'll be faced with hours of arm falling off sanding. If you have some kind of sanding machine this might be easier, but using your hands gives you complete control. I started with the 160 grade wet/dry sandpaper.Once I had gotten rid of all the impurities I could. I moved down a grade, 240. I sanded away, this grade would be used to remove the scratches left by the 160, But it also leaves smaller scratches behind. Moving down in grades creates smaller and smaller scratches on the surface of your material. Once you're down at 1600, you should have a very smooth ring. but it wont be clear. It's your choice now whether to move on to polishing and buffing. Which will remove the last tiny scratches left by the sanding process. I decided to leave it unpolished.When sanding I decided I would like rounded edges, so I sanded heavily around the edges with 160 grade paper. This actually gives the illusion that the board is wider than it really is, since the resin acts like a lens and it almost warps the LEDs around the edges a little.

But since I started working on the casing I had left the programming side to the end, that is why I had to include a programming socket. Can you imagine if there was a bug in my code and I had no way to fix it!!Here is where another problem showed itself. A broken LED!! I had written a small test program that would show a pattern on the LEDs when power was applied, this pattern would cycle though colours to tell me that everything was working as intended. However I was only testing every second LED on the outer ring. Once I had programed to use the inner ring I discovered that only the first half worked, the second half wouldn't display anything. Strange enough, if the LEDs were powered from 3.6volts instead of 5, data would pass through this LED, but it still didn't display anything. However the colours given off by the LEDs are much better at 5v. so I decided to cut my losses and just use 60 LEDs of my ring. This is actually a blessing in disguise, because I had only done a quick calculation in the back of my head while selection the brains of this clock. The chosen MCU the MSP430G2553 only has 512bytes of RAM. Yes, bytes. I had programmed a buffer to store all the LED values, they would then be transmitted in one quick burst to all the LEDs, this buffer takes up 360 bytes of our precious resource, that's a little over 70% of the RAM gone right there. As it turns out, one of the coolest features of this clock is a capacitive touch sensor arrangement that I embedded into the edge of the PCB, Honestly I didn't even know if it would work, I've never made capacitive sensors that way before. But they did work, and work well. TI, the manufacture of the MSP430 microcontroller line, create an API for reading capacitive sensors, the capacitive touch software library. It is fantastic, however because of all the work it has to do, it uses alot of RAM. The 12 elements I needed to measure use 48 bytes, to store current measure values and a baseline value. then calling the function consumes space on the stack, I debugged some library calls, and found about 30-40 bytes was used.If you are unfamiliar with computer memory layout, and you are interested in it, I suggest you look that up. Put bluntly when the STACK enters into the HEAP is known as a stack overflow. It was happening to me, I kept getting strange unpredictable results, because two parts of my code were accessing the same location in memory, overriding each others information.

I hope this will give a softer glow from the ring. For power I am using very thin, 0.5mm magnet wire, or enamel wire. If the LED used too much power, wires this thin wouldn't be able to carry the required current. However with only a few segments lit the clock doesn't consume much power at all. The positive is that these wires are almost too thin to see.Because the wires are enamel coated you will need to tin the ends of them with your soldering iron before use. I used a small proprietary 5 volt phone charger to power the clock, I removed the plug from the end and soldered on some wires. Be sure to heatshrink over exposed wires. I used some textbooks to hold up the ring at the correct height when fixing the thin enamel power wires, finally textbooks have a use (I am kidding of course).

I had many parts lying around the garage such as stepper motors, resistors, LEDs, etc. You are welcome to customize your project to incorporate whatever you have available to you. Stepper Motors: Stepper motors are a useful tool when slow rotational motion is required. There is plenty of literature on stepper motors so I won't go into the details here, but encourage you to learn more about these motors so you are able to understand how to drive one. Be sure to get a stepper motor with a large number of \"steps\" so that the rotation of the ring will be smooth and not jerky. LEDs: There is a link to the LED strip used in my box. They are very cheap and because only a few are being used for this project, can be utilized again and again.

This is for those who do not wish to reverse engineer the board through the schematic/board design files. The input of the board can be anywhere from 15-30V because of the rated input of both the LM7805 and LM7812. These are voltage regulators which take the input voltage, and with the help of a decoupling capacitor produce a stable voltage (5V for the 7805 and 12V for the 7812). There are LEDs that will indicate if your voltage regulators are working correctly. If an LED is not on, first check to see if your LED is correctly positioned with the Anode and Cathode in the correct locations and then check to see if your voltage regulator is correctly positioned. The 7805 gives 5V to the ATMEGA-328 IC from the Arduino UNO. The 7812 gives 12V to the driver (ULN2003) and the LED strip. Because of the amount of current being pulled by the motor as well as the voltage needed, it is not ideal to run the motor directly from the outputs of the IC. The ULN2003 allows the IC to control a higher voltage and isolates the higher current away from the \"brain\" of the board. For customizability the potentiometer is connected to an input on the IC. Also the LED strip is connected to an output so that it may be dimmed, strobed, or turned on/off as needed. The photoresistor on the rim of the box allows the board to know when the lid is opened and acts as another optional input. The sensitivity of this input can be adjusted within the code. Because I planned my proposal at night, I set the box to always be on and used the power button on the bottom of the box to switch the circuit on.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FU7/K41A/I4SCJFXQ/FU7K41AI4SCJFXQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F18/0Z1A/I4SCJFZS/F180Z1AI4SCJFZS.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: More on the Board"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "After testing to make sure all parts are able to fit in their respective footprints and no errors were made in the manufacturing of the board, the parts can be placed on the board and soldered down.

Make sure when you solder the voltage regulators that they are positioned correctly and not backwards. The same goes for the LEDs. The red line on the bottom of the LEDs should go to the ground side. Once you have made sure that you are delivering 5V and 12V to the proper places, it is time to solder the sockets for the \"ic\"s. Since these are sockets you can still check to ensure that voltages are correct before inserting your ic. There were small tabs on the sides of the circuit board which left a rough edge. With a file it was easy to smooth these out rather quickly.Wires should also be soldered to the solder pads on the board for the photo resistor, LEDs, power button, battery cables, and stepper motor. Make sure that you don't solder the wires onto the actual resistor, or LEDs yet as these will need to be added later after other steps have been completed.

This section will be most useful for those sourcing their own parts, if you are building from a kit, feel free to skip ahead.Where to buy:You can find these solar panels and motors all over the web. eBay has quite a few people selling them in bulk. You can use any cell you want, but the big factor is the size. The 2V rectangular cells work well in this case, though a small round cell would be fun to turn into a Solar Ladybug.Motors can be bought in various sizes or shapes. Alternately, you can steal the vibrating motor out of an old cell phone or pager. This will save you $2.You can also find individual parts for these kits on BrownDogGadgets.com, in case you're only missing one or two pieces. Feel free to contact us about discounts for educators or large orders.What to look forSolar Cells:As mentioned on the parts list, you can use any sort of solar cell for this project, however, there are some things to keep in mind. While you can find heaps of different types of solar cells on the internet these days, not every cell is equal.As we're using small motors, we're going to need a certain amount of power. I've found that most of the little vibrating motors you buy online need at least 1.5V and 30mA to trigger. We want our solar panel to go above and beyond that threshold. When solar panels are rated, they're given a rating at their max power level, which usually means noon on a sunny day. As these conditions don't exist all the time, we have to expect that our solar cell will usually be operating at a lower power level than what it's rated for.The second thing to keep in mind is the size of the solar cell in relation to your motor. The bigger and heavier the cell, the stronger the motor you'll need to get it moving, the stronger the motor, the more power it will require... And on and on.The key is to find a solar cell that is both small and has a good kick behind it. Salvaging solar cells from old garden lights has worked for us in the past, though often times they lack the current to get the motor started. The ones we prefer to use are some long and skinny 2V 50mA solar cells. They're cheap and easy to find online from quite a few places.Motors:Small vibrating motors can be found everywhere, and you probably have several in your house right now, if not in your pocket. Common electronics such as cell phones, pagers, video game controllers, and electric toothbrushes all make use of these types of motor. You can easily scavenge broken or obsolete items for their motors, though you will find a large range of sizes. As with the solar panels, you have to hit the sweet spot between too large to turn on, and too small to move your roach.Questions to ask your motor before you buy it:1) Do you have soldering points?You want a motor (and panel) either with wires, or large enough tabs to easily solder to. You don\u2019t want to wind up with a motor you can\u2019t connect to your panel.2) Do you meet my power needs?You need a motor that is rated to work at a very low voltage, aim for 1.5V. Most will do this just fine but we've occasionally run into some that need 2.5V or even 3V. Also remember that you need a DC motor, not AC.3) Are you strong enough?You can buy some really small vibrating motors, but they're not going to be strong enough move your roach. Usually the ones that are 15mm - 20mm long will do the trick.4) Are you too expensive?If you're paying more than $3 for a motor you're paying too much, especially when you figure in that shipping is never free. Just buy one off one of the websites above when you're buying some other hobby items. Find a couple of little projects on instructables and make an order.

You can test your motor placement by holding the panel in the sun and pressing the wires to different combinations of leads until you feel movement. Alternately, use a multimeter to test for resistance between leads. You want to use two leads that appear to be an open circuit, not two leads that appear to be a short circuit. Lay your solar cell down, and align the wires from the motor with the leads on the solar cell. It does not matter which wire goes to which lead, the motor will spin either clockwise or counterclockwise depending on how you wire it. If you have one of our kits, your motor comes with an adhesive backing on one side. Make sure your wires reach the contacts before sticking down the motor.Place your soldering iron tip so it is touching both the wire and the solder point, while keeping your solder on the other side. Touch the end of the solder to the terminal, and it will melt to make the connection. It can be helpful to arch your wires before soldering to prevent them from springing away once the soldering iron is removed, and before the solder has a chance to harden. Repeat this step for the other wire and terminal.Once cool, turn your solar cell over just to make sure everything is well connected. If you like, you can go outside and test it out. If your motor doesn\u2019t vibrate when the solar panel is exposed to bright sunlight, you may have a poor connection, or you may have soldered to the wrong terminals.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FVW/SFAU/ICYMZRXP/FVWSFAUICYMZRXP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM1/JVJJ/ICYMZRXS/FM1JVJJICYMZRXS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHC/UFE1/ICYN01BM/FHCUFE1ICYN01BM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBZ/FIZL/ICYN01BE/FBZFIZLICYN01BE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6H/5DRF/ICYN01BC/F6H5DRFICYN01BC.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Soldering"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Use your wire cutters to cut two paperclips in half, which should leave you four pieces with a U-bend in the middle, and a hook at one end.

Put a drop of hot glue on the bottom of the solar panel and stick the U-bend of two pairs of legs into it. You have to hold the legs while the glue cools and hardens, but after 30 seconds or so you will be able to let go. Watch for the glue to go from clear to cloudy for a clue that it\u2019s almost done.

Because this pin is a PWM type, the speed on which the motor will turn, depend on the value of \"MotorSpeed\" variable, at pin 6 (value range from 0 to 255).The function should also ensure that the front engine \"rotate freely\" and for that, the pin 5 which is the pin \"enable\", should be LOW (the status of pins 2 and 3 do not matter, since the enable is LOW). The LED \"ledRed\" that emulates a \"reverse gear light\" should always be off when the car moves forward:void moveForward() // rear motor FW\n{ \n  analogWrite(rearMtEne, motorSpeed);\n  digitalWrite(rearMtFw, HIGH);\n  digitalWrite(rearMtBw, LOW);\n  \n  digitalWrite(frontMtEne, LOW);\n  digitalWrite(ledRed, LOW);\n  delay(5);\n}By analogy, it is obvious that to make the car \"move back\", the motor must rotate in the opposite direction. For this, the pin 4 must be LOW and HIGH pin 7. Note that in this case of the \" reverse gear light\" should be on. The function in this case will be:void moveBackward() // rear motor BW\n{ \n  analogWrite(rearMtEne, motorSpeed);\n  digitalWrite(rearMtFw, LOW);\n  digitalWrite(rearMtBw, HIGH);\n  \n  digitalWrite(frontMtEne, LOW);\n  digitalWrite(ledRed, HIGH);\n  delay(5);\n}\nThe same reasoning can be used for the front engine, only that in this case there is no speed control. Putting the pin 2 (enable) HIGH enables the engine to \"try to turn\" to one side or the other depending on the status of pins 2 and 3: void moveLeft() // front motor left\n{ \n  digitalWrite(frontMtEne, HIGH);\n  digitalWrite(frontMtLeft, HIGH);\n  digitalWrite(frontMtRight, LOW);\n  digitalWrite(ledRed, LOW);\n  delay(10);\n}\n\n//******************************************************************************//  \n\nvoid moveRight() // front motor right\n{ \n  digitalWrite(frontMtEne, HIGH);\n  digitalWrite(frontMtLeft, LOW);\n  digitalWrite(frontMtRight, HIGH);\n  digitalWrite(ledRed, LOW);\n  delay(10);\n}\nTo stop the car, just put all the bridge's outputs for the rear motor in LOW, what will \"catch\" the motor shaft . For the front motor, just put the enable pin in LOW): \nvoid stopRobot ()\n{\n  digitalWrite(ledBlue, LOW);\n  digitalWrite(ledRed, LOW);\n  \n  state = 0;\n  moveStop(); //turn off both motors\n}\nIn the link below, you can find the complete code for the Arduino:", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSX/TPQF/INZ2VFFD/FSXTPQFINZ2VFFD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJK/QHLD/INZ2VFFC/FJKQHLDINZ2VFFC.LARGE.jpg", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png"], "step_title": "Step 8: \u200bTriggering DC MOTORS VIA H-BRIDGE"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "Congratulations! your RC car is properly \"hacked\" and ready to win the world!

I then cut the lid to hold the inverter and fastened the inverter to the lid with metal strapping tape and screws. The batteries are wired in parallel and then connected to the inverter. I soldered each of the ring connectors to the wires and I used 6 or 8 gauge wire that I had on hand.

It is always a good idea to let them breathe though so I cut the hole a little larger in the front of the lid to allow some air in and around the inverter. Never wrap an inverter in rags or place onto combustible material.I added a 3D printed plate to dress up the rough hole cut in the front of the lid with a jig saw. I painted it with paint left over from a recent project that came close to the color of the case. That is all that is to this build. Pictures should help illustrate how simple this build is. My battery box is very well packed with dense lead acid 12-volt power. it weighs in at 95 pounds and therefore is best moved by two people even though the box has handles.It would cost somewhere around $700 to assemble all the parts ", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F4L/NHUZ/JN3HUKMZ/F4LNHUZJN3HUKMZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIR/1R4M/JN3HUKNE/FIR1R4MJN3HUKNE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNJ/YKUS/JN3HUKNW/FNJYKUSJN3HUKNW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAR/NC89/JN3HUKLT/FARNC89JN3HUKLT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0E/WZC3/JN3HUKKT/F0EWZC3JN3HUKKT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWG/P7V7/JN3HUKKA/FWGP7V7JN3HUKKA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWZ/E65I/JN4VEIYQ/FWZE65IJN4VEIYQ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: The Build"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "I now have six 12-volt batteries supplying a useful amount of 120-volt AC power. Why does it all work though?I may get myself deeper into this question than I want to, but I am going to try to clear up (define) some basic electrical terms and principles. Sometimes I need to look up some of the following terms and principles to get the desired results from projects that I build. So I thought that I would share some useful terms and concepts. I should state that I am not an electrical engineer, nor an electrician, so feel free to correct me if I get anything wrong and I will correct it. You may ask any questions you wish, but be aware that I may not know the answer.What are parallel circuits and how to they compare to wiring in series? In my projects I am often referring to Parallel or in Series wiring. Batteries in parallel are wired plus terminal to plus terminal(s) and negative terminal to negative terminal(s). This does not change the total output voltage of the batteries. An example is 6 each 12 volt batteries in parallel yields 12 volts of power. That is how this battery project is wired.Batteries in series are wired Plus terminal to Negative terminal and so one. With each battery adding its voltage to the last. An example is three AA batteries at 1.5 Volts each yields voltage of 4.5 volts when wired in series and only 1.5 volts when wired in parallel. This can also refer to say LED bulbs as well. Let\u2019s say we are using bulbs requiring power of 3 volts. These bulbs when wired in parallel will only need 3 volts supplied to them. Whereas the same bulbs requiring 3 volts when wired in series will require 6 volts for two and 9 volts for three.Another note when combining batteries in either parallel or series they should be the same type of battery with the same ampere hour (Ah or mAh) values. These principles are noted in photos above with inserted notes calling out details. The screen shots are taken from \" Tinkercad Circuits\", which is a very nice new tool in Tinkercad.What is an inverter and how does it work? An inverter converts electricity from DC current to AC. I am not going to get into much detail as to how it does this, but it increases the DC voltage and then changes it to alternating current before sending it off to the device. You need to know what the power requirements are of the device you are going to power with your inverter and what is the power of the source feeding the inverter. Most of the time the source will be 12 volts DC with 120 Volt AC output. You may be able to get by with a small 400 W inverter or you may need a 3000 W inverter depending on what you are powering: a light bulb or a circular saw. So, determine that the inverter you use is greater than the start-up (surge) power needed by the device(s) you plan to power with it. Also, be aware that the sine wave output of an inverter is often a \u201csquare\u201d wave (modified sine) rather than the nice even rounded sine wave of AC power from the wall. This may not matter if you are powering an electric motor, but it might matter when powering communication, medical, or navigation equipment for example. (sine wave and power requirement chart in photos above)AC vs DC power \u2013 AC, alternating current, is what you have at the outlets in your house. DC, direct current, is what you find in batteries of all kinds; such as the battery that powers your car or the AA batteries that you put into your remote control.In DC power the direction of the electrons flows from the negative terminal to the positive terminal in one direction like the movement of water through a hose. DC power is generally used in lower voltages than AC power. In AC current the direction of the electrons is constantly switching directions. Up to 60 times per second in most US power systems. AC power is easier to operate at higher voltages than DC power.What happens to amp hours when you wire batteries in series vs in parallel? Amp hours when batteries are wired in series equals what the batteries read. If in this build I had wired all 6 batteries in series instead of parallel they would yield 72 volts, but only 22 Ah. Whereas the 6 batteries of this project are wired in parallel at 12 volts and together they yield 132 Amp hours. Yeah!!!!What is an SLA battery?  SLA = Sealed Lead Acid. Meaning a DC battery that will not leak if tipped over or mounted on its side.What are sine waves and how does it affect power? With AC power from \"The Grid\" the sine wave is very smooth like that waves in the ocean without wind yielding smooth well rounded peaks and valleys. With AC power generated from a DC source with an inverter you can have fairly \u201csquare\u201d sine waves. This is generally not a big problem if you are powering a motor, lights or other nontechnical items. However, if you are powering navigation, medical, or communication equipment this can create interference. Invertors can be built to provide clean sine wave power, but the cleaner the wave generated the greater the cost of the inverter. What is Amperage (A)? The number of electrons is measured in Ampere (Amps) and is known as current.What is Amp Hours (Ah)? Think of Ah as the fuel tank. Where Ah is a unit of electric charge multiplied by time. This is equal to the charge transferred by a steady current of one ampere flowing for one hour. You will often see this expressed as milliampere, mAh, which is one-thousandth of an ampere hour.What is Wattage (W)? Wattage is the measurement of power required to run a device and is measured in Watts. Another way of putting this is: Electric power is the rate, per unit time, at which electrical energy is transferred by an electric circuit. Where one watt equals one joule per second. This is the gauge for the size of inverter needed to power your device or devices.What are Ohms? Ohms are a unit of measurement for electrical resistance. Some materials flow power easily while other materials create resistance thus impeding the movement of electrons. This is also why you need to use 8 gauge wire at a minimum (6 gauge is better) so that we can get the flow needed between batteries and to the inverter without melting wires.What is Voltage? Electric pressure (potential energy) between two points measured as a volt.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FU5/5J2F/JN28IMRR/FU55J2FJN28IMRR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDN/SDCD/JN28IMRY/FDNSDCDJN28IMRY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZH/LK58/JN28IMS0/FZHLK58JN28IMS0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPX/Q4VU/JN28IMRZ/FPXQ4VUJN28IMRZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F28/P96J/JN28BWKS/F28P96JJN28BWKS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTK/YPR9/JN28BW83/FTKYPR9JN28BW83.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: The Principles Behind the Build"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "The first task we used the portable power box for was to power a baseball pitching machine. Unfortunately the first inverter I installed in the box was a 750 Watt / 1500-Watt peak inverter and it was not enough power to run the pitching machine for my Son\u2019s little league team. Batting practice is important of course so I bought a 1500 Watt / 3000-Watt Peak inverter and installed it into the box in place of the smaller inverter. The larger inverter works, but it too goes into alarm/cut off and it blows the fuse in the pitching machine if I do not start the fly wheel spinning by hand before turning on the pitching machine\u2019s power switch. I really can not say why this happens as the pitching machine will start fine when plugged into an AC wall socket without blowing the fuse. I think that it may be how the power is delivered from the inverter or perhaps it may be the sine wave of the power delivered as discussed earlier. The pitching machine takes the 120 V power supplied by the inverter and converts it back to 90 V DC power to run the motor. There has been a couple of solid feedbacks from others on Instructables regarding why it blows the fuse on the pitching machine without a rolling start. Here is one of the comments that I feel explains well the situation: In relation to your comment on why the fuse blows using the power box and not when using a AC supply. Most inverter's put out a square wave, some produce what is called a pseudo sine wave which is a stepped square wave that grows and decreases in height (voltage) by steps following approximately the curve of the 180 degrees of the sine wave cycle in the positive and negative directions, this type of inverter behaves nearly identically as the AC power from the grid, but the inverter's that do no do this, that are just square wave generators as you can see with an oscilloscope you have basically two types, one that generates a square wave that lasts the 180 degrees of the positive and negative cycle, the other type generates a square wave that lasts less than the 180 degrees of the positive and negative cycle. The inverter's of the first type, the output voltage I believe must equal the RMS voltage of the sine wave, if it does not and the output is higher between the RMS and peak value it will probably blow the fuse depending on the time lag that the fuse has and the starting current that the motor draws when starting from a dead start (all motors draw varying amounts of power from a dead start that can vary from 3 to 10 times their running power). The inverter's of the second type as they generate a square pulse for a square wave that does not last as long as 180 degrees of the cycle are obliged to put out a higher voltage than the RMS value so as to integrate the same power as a sine wave does over the full 180 degrees of the cycle. If your inverter is of this second type you must be careful when powering equipment that include MOV's in the power supply as protection against spikes on the power line, as in many cases the voltage level may enter the protection range of the MOV and it may explode or in a worse case catch fire. I only trust an oscilloscope to give me the real values of voltage that any of these inverter's put out. Best regard's. JohnH848It really is nice to have the pitching machine running in complete silence from the power box and rather than powered from a generator running in the infield.I anticipate many years of use from this box for all kinds of tasks from powering my niece and nephew\u2019s backyard play house to recharging the Razor motorcycles that I build (see  https://www.instructables.com/id/Battery-Powered-motorcycle ). The box is heavy to move therefore it will not be used for everything, but it is a nice option to have when needed. It is obviously much quieter than our generator and provides the same Watts of usable power. Of course the generator will provide power for as long as I have gasoline, but eventually I do need to plug in the batteries for a recharge of the battery box.I hope that you found some value in this write up. Questions or Comments are always welcome. I will do my best to answer in a timely and accurate fashion.Thank you.

Being a university student however, money is not exactly something that I have in abundance. This has lead for me to try and find ways to create ways of building, and experimenting with multiple different devices within my very shallow price range.I've always found the concept of using motors as electric generators extremely interesting, and since I had a spare stepper motor from a previous project I thought I would have a little fun with it. Why did I choose a steppor motor? The cheapest and probably most commonly found type of electric motor is the small DC motor. These are ideal for projects such as remote controls cars/ helicopters etc, but are far from perfect for use as electric generators. Why is that? Well these DC model motors are designed so that the can produce the maximum number of rotations (or RPM) for as small a current as possible. For a kinetic generator however, we want to be able to produce as much current as possible from as little rotations as possible, a problem not shared as much by an AC motor. So yeah, try and stay away from the DC motors.Straying away from DC motors does make this whole process a tad longer though I'm afraid. The great thing about DC motors is, well, that they're DC. This means that the voltage outputted from the motor (I suppose really I should be saying that you input to the motor) is constant, and hence does not fluctuate. A stepper motor however, is not. This means that the current produced from a motor of this type is alternating (follows the shape of a sine wave). This is not very useful if you hope to use your generator to power, or to charge most electronics or batteries. But have no fear for we have the wonder of rectifier diodes! I'm not going to go into too much detail as to what they are and how we use them now as that will come in later. All you need to know know is that we shall use 8 of them to create two diode bridges, which along with the capacitors and resistors, will hopefully turn the AC output, into a DC one.This turbine is potentially powerful enough to power a series of LED's, to power a small bulb or even charge rechargeable batteries.", "title": "Make a Hydro-Electric Turbine From Scrap or Left Over Parts", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Make-a-Hydro-Electric-Turbine-From-Scrap-or-Left-O/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Especially if you're a frequent electronics hobbyist, most if not all of these materials can probably be found lying around.

The stepper motor has four wires coming out of it, two correspond to one of the coils in the motor, whilst the other two correspond with the other coil. This is important as we basically have to create a different circuit for each coil.So first of all we want to take four diodes, and with them construct a diode bridge. What this section of the circuit ensures is that the entirety of the AC current coming form the motor is positive, and hence can be used in DC electronics. For a graphical representation of this refer to the picture at the top of this step.Finally we come across the resistor and capacitor in series with one another. This, for obvious reasons, is called an RC circuit. What this does is it basically smooths out the signal, effectively converting it from AC to DC, again as shown in one of the earlier pictures (The diode bridge is the diamond with the four triangles with lines on the point). When placing these diodes into the breadboard, make sure you place them the right way round. You should find that there is a light grey band on the end of the diode corresponding to the line across the triangle in the circuit diagram. Also do the same for the capacitor. Ensure that the positive (the longer of the two pins) is connected to the output of the diode bridge, and the negative (should have a great strip above the pin with a '-' sign) to the next part of the circuit.OK brilliant! All that needs to be done now is to recreate this circuit for the other coil and that's the circuitry done! We have managed to generate a DC signal that can be used to power pretty much any small household electronics. Bare in mind whilst selecting your motor that these kind of project are all about the currents produced.

This will change when the proposed granted Panacea\u00a0 research and development centre is erected. Panacea-BOCAF has attempted to convey the following information into as much of a laymen\u2019s perspective as possible. The replication of the RV was done by Panacea as a non profit gesture to provide the public with energy saving awareness and applications for an environmental benefit.

The following is a segment taken from The Panacea Farm conversion. In the following video Panacea donated a Drill to the farm too use. Wehn compared to the Drill bieng used onthe farm, the RV saved significant energy.\nThe Panacea Farm Conversion - The Roto Verter Segment\nThe RV is an alternative energy device which is currently being utilized by open source engineers around the world in energy saving applications, and to transform and understand ZPE when configured in looped (self running mode) mode.\nThe RV principle is a far superior energy saving device and can save significant energy in standard electric motor applications TODAY. Please consult the Panacea university document and support the inventor. Panacea-BOCAF intends to collect grant support for the inventor and the open source engineers who have made it possible for this awareness to reach the public.\nPanacea-BOCAF has launched recent replicated results of the RV's energy savings. Baldor motors and drives Australia have also sponsored Panacea and have generously donated two free motors towards helping to saving the planet.\nWhen run in RV mode, these Baldor motors are the most efficient 1 HP electric motors in the world. The RV's energy savings applications will save the public energy and money. Please consult this Panacea promotional press release for further details\nThe following presentation on the RV will be divided into two separate sections. The first will explain the RV in the role of ZPE research, the second will describe the RV as an energy savings application.\nBackground - Hector has explained to us that in order to acheive the extraction of ZPE (zero point energy) and to be able to self run the RV, a prior understanding and experience from using the RV in an energy saving power management application is vital.\nThe energy saving RV configuration proves that currently 1HP (horse power) electric motors waste energy by their inefficient configuration and that as a result, the ability to engineer a ZPE transformation is thus out of reach. The RV is an R & D tool designed to work with those issues in power management and to find solutions and applications for ZPE engineering.\nTechnically the RV is explained by the Roto-conversion: A Way to operate a motor at Hi impedances with a lower reflective power loss at idle mode.

The intent is\u00a0to extract this reactive power into usable watts and create \u00a0a condition that is non reflective to the source, or input side. Several versions of these configurations are presently on the R and D design board.\u00a0\n\t\u00a0There have been reports of various individuals who have converted the captured reactive power back into a usable form of energy.

Hector has disclosed this method publicly on the internet for all to perfect and replicate.\nHector states that the RV Looped systems are possible and are in need of further lab testing in order to be perfected.Technically Hector describes this concept as possible by simply using non reflective fractional resonant power extraction or ballun compensated direct tensor loading.\nHector has also offered what he considers to be laymen\u2019s methods and solutions using his split capacitors diode resonant systems (plug) to split power dividers to extract non reflective excess power.\nAdditionally the open source engineers working with Panacea are testing other circuits and design concepts which incorporate certain power switching circuits to helpmake this EXCESS energy extractable and usable.\nThis looped sequence involves transformers (unseen in the picture above) which represents the down grading of voltage from the generators resonating circulating output current. The transformer primary , secondary , plus battery with one transistor and a few extra parts of capacitors, diode bridge ,resistors , mica caps , & more blocking diodes are described by Hector as all that is needed to close the loop and extract the excess output and put back into the battery.\nHector also describes the closed loop as being achieved from the impedance matching (amplitude) of the resonant generators output elements relative to the batteries input amperage.A reminder for those wishing to evaluate the schematic, the looped ZPE plans are available in the Panacea university course compilation provided above.\nThe issue of a successful replication of the looped design is however complicated. So far to achieve this advanced level, Hector is in need of grants and to also be recruited into an R and D environment to offer this education, and, follow through with the RV's public disclosure.\nPlus security is also needed from the political and economic conditions which Panacea can provide in the Panacea proposed granted research and development center.Recently at the end of 2008 two enigneer's known to Panacea successfully looped the RV and encounted interference.\nHector's original concept has since has been improved with a dual battery switching concept and with many other modifications. It is advanced R and D, brand new and very difficult for the first timer to grasp and replicate.\nThis is why we need to recruit Hector and all the open source engineers working on the RV technology into the Panacea proposed granted research and development center where we the public can provide grant support and SAFTY for this research.\nOnly through open source technology disclosures can this technology reach the public to capacity and allow green energy technology to operate and stay UN suppressed.

This allows programmers to give information about how their program works to help themselves or other programmers figure out how the code works.Next I would like you to read over the following links on the Arduino page. If you're new to programming don't be discouraged if they don't make any sense to you. I will re-explain them in simpler terms. You will need to get used to reading and understanding documentation like that as your programming skills develop.http://www.arduino.cc/en/reference/serialhttp://www.arduino.cc/en/Serial/Beginhttp://www.arduino.cc/en/Serial/Println1. Serial.println() is called a function. Most things in programming involve using functions. Later in this tutorial you will learn how to write your very own functions! Serial.println() is a function that will print over the Arduino's serial line. When connected to your computer you can view what is printed by clicking on the serial monitor.2. \"I print once\" is a parameter of the Serial.println() function. The parameter is your input to the function and in this case tells the function what to print. Try changing this to something else such as \"I love hotdogs\" and running the code again. Make sure to surround your words with quotations marks (\u201c \u201c).3. If you look at the first line displayed on the serial monitor it says \"I print once\". I on occasion you will get a funny character or two before the first line to print. Do not worry about this. Also notice how this is only printed once because it happens in the void setup portion of the code. Note: to see the first line you must un-check the box labeled Autoscroll and then scroll back to the top (Or have really fast eyes).4. Notice how \"I print again and again\" continues to print over and over again. This is because it is in the void loop portion of the code. This code will continue to run over and over again until the end of the universe! Or until you disconnect/reprogram your Arduino.5.

To demonstrate our magnificent power to do this we're going to make an LED (a light) blink.Let's start off simple by getting an LED to turn on.To do this you will need 1 LED, 1 220 ohm Resistor, 1 bread board and some wire.1. LEDs are a Light Emitting Diode. Diodes are a device which electricity can only go through them one way. The shorter side of the LED is the negative side. You will be plugging this into the negative rail of the bread board.2. We're going to use the Arduino as the power source for our LED. This means you need to have it plugged into your computer to work. Every Arduino is arranged differently but the pins should be labeled. I have marked where the 5 volt and GND (0 volts) are on my board.2-1. 5V this is the five volt source on your Arduino. This needs to be wired to the Positive rail on your bread board.2-2. GND this is where the electricity comes back to after it's done doing work also known as 0 Volts. This needs to be wired to the negative rail of your bread board. 3. This a bread board. It's very helpful for wiring up and prototyping circuits.3-1. Negative rail -This is the rail with a Minus sign over it and a blue stripe next to it. This is typically used as a ground rail. Everything connected to one point on the rail is connected to every point on the rail. There are two Negative rails on the breadboard pictured. One on the left side of the board and one of the right side of the board.3-2. Positive rail - This is the rail with a Plus sign over it and a red stripe next to it. This is typically used as a positive voltage rail, in our case 5 volts. Everything connected to one point on the rail is connected to every point on the rail. There are two Positive rails on the breadboard pictured. One on the left side of the board and one of the right side of the board.3-3, Rows, are like mini rails. They connect going horizontally across the board. For example row 1 connects 1a through 1e together. The big gap in the board indicate the 1f through 1j are connected together but not to  1a through 1e.Wiring this all together1) Connect 5V to the Positive rail of the breadboard2) Connect GND to the Negative rail of the breadboard3) Connect the short end of the LED to the negative rail of the breadboard4) Connect the long end of the LED to 1a5) Connect the resistor from 1c to the positive rail6) Appreciate the fine glow of your LED (If LED not glowing trying flipping it around. You probably got the ends mixed up)Now to make it blink move the resistor from the Positive rail to the Negative rail and then back to the Positive rail once a second. I'm sure as you quickly realized this is extremely tedious and you'd much rather not have to manually move the resistor. Well your're in luck!

The first parameter is the pin you are talking about. In this case pin 13. The second parameter is OUTPUT this is saying you want to be able to set pin 13 between 0 Volts and 5 Volts in your program. 2. digitalWrite() is a function that sets the specified pin to LOW (0 Volts) or HIGH (5 Volts). The first parameter is 13 the pin we want to control. The second parameter is either HIGH or LOW. Setting it to HIGH is like when you were connecting the resistor to the positive rail. Setting it to LOW is like when you connected it to the negative rail.3. delay() is a function the stops the Arduino for a set amount of time. Think of this as when you were waiting one second between going switching rails.

This is called a pull down resistor because it pulls the voltage back down to 0 Volts when the switch is open (not pressed). When the switch is closed (pressed) the resistor is so large it has little effect on the voltage and so it is 5 volts.Open up the file called LimitSwitch with arduino.  As usual read over the documentation before I give you the simplified explanation.http://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/DigitalRead1. This command creates a new variable named pin12Value. The part in blue \"int\" specifies the type of variable. int is short for integer. Arduino needs to know what type of variables it's working with to efficiently store them in memory and do operations on them such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The second part is the name of the variable and how you refer to it later in your code.2. digitalRead() this function returns a 1 (HIGH) or a 0 (LOW) depending on if there is 5 Volts applied to the pin or 0 Volts applied to the pin it is reading.3. This next part is called an assignment. We are setting pin12Value to a 1 or a 0 depending on whether or not the limit switch is pressed and pin 12 is High. 4. Now we use Serial.println(pin12Value) to print the value of pin12Value. If you observer the serial monitor as you push the limit switch you should notice it go from 0 to 1.So, this would look a lot nicer and easier to understand if HIGH and LOW were printed instead of just 1s and 0s. We can accomplish this using if statements!Try to read over and understand the documentation on if statements below before preceding to my explanation.http://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/IfOpen LimitSwitchIf in Arduino and run it  1. This is an if statement. If the condition is true then the code inside the curly brackets will run. If the condition is not true the code in the curly brackets will be skipped.2. This is the condition of the if statement. This is asking a question, does pin12Value equal 1? If the answer is yes then the expression evaluates to true. Be careful and realize that the == is different than the = sign. == is asking a question. Are they equal? = is a command setting whats on the left side to be equal to what's on the right side.3. This is the code in the curly brackets that runs when the statement is true.Challenge: Use what you've learned to have the LED turn on when the switch is pressed and off when it's releasedTo see how I accomplished the challenge open LimitSwitchLEDChallenge2: Use what you've learned to have 2 LEDs each turned on by a different switch.To see how I accomplished the challenge open LimitSwitchLED2", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQJ/TFCJ/IA5IXMU2/FQJTFCJIA5IXMU2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP7/IQ12/IDK2K8U0/FP7IQ12IDK2K8U0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F18/WAAC/IDK2KB61/F18WAACIDK2KB61.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Inputs, Variables, and Switches"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "So for this next part were going to be using an H-bridge.

This chip is capable of powering two motors. One is wired to the left half of the chip the other on the right half of the chip. I will now describe what each pin does.1.) This is the enable line for motor 1. When this is HIGH, 5 volts. The motor can be driven. When it is LOW, 0 Volts the motor will not operate. This can be used with a PWM signal (We will learn about later) to control the speed of the motor by turning it on and off really fast.2.) This is a control line for motor 1. You use this with pin 7 to control which direction the motor 1 spins. If pin 2 is set HIGH and pin 6 is set LOW. The motor will spin one way. If you flip them so pin 6 is HIGH and pin 2 is LOW the motor will change direction. In all other states the motor does not spin.3.) This pin gets wired to one side of Motor 1. The other side of Motor 1 gets wired to pin 64.) This goes to your Ground Rail, 0 Volts. This is where the power from the motor exits.5.) Same as 46.)

Make sure you connect the GND (0 Volts) of the Arduino with the - of the battery (0 Volts). And DO NOT connect the 5V of the Arduino with the + of the battery (9 Volts).

As I'm sure you've started to realize getting a motor to run requires you to be keeping track of multiple things, what speed you want it to run, what direction you want it to run, and what pins need to be HIGH and LOW to get this all to work.In the file called MotorFunctions you can see some example functions we wrote for you and their explanation below.1.) This part of the function declaration is the return type. We picked void because this function will not be returning anything. For example if you wanted to return a number you would use int. This might come in handy if you had a function that added two numbers together and returned their sum.2.) This part of the function is the function name. This is the name you will use to call your function later in the code.3.) These are the parameters of the function. Here you specify how many parameters you will take and what they will be called. For this one we have one parameter motorSpeed, and it is a number so we used the the type int. Specify parameters is just like declaring variables because they are essentially variables that are shared with your function from what called your function.4.) This is the code that the function runs.5.) Return statement, because we do not return anything we simply put this statement. If we were returning something. We would place that after the return statement.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 9: Writing Functions"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "Yeah this sounds like a good idea but I'm probably not going to get to it any time soon.

Be patient though, as I tend to be a busy body.    :)     -------------------------------------------------------------------------------3D printing is all the rage these days. There is a huge variety of FDM (Fused deposition modeling) printers to choose from, and found just about anywhere! But it also has its limitations, the main one being accuracy. This is where resin based printing comes in.Resin based printing's main advantage is accuracy. FDM is limited by nozzle size, while Resin is limited only by how much you can focus a UV laser/light source. Thus, you can attain significantly higher resolutions.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------There are two main types of printing with Resin. The first is SLA, which stands for Stereolithography. This method uses a laser which is focused to a point, and moved around the build area, very similar to how a FDM printer moves a nozzle around the build area to create a part. This is the technology that the popular FormLabs uses in its machines.The second is DLP, which stands for Digital Light Processing. This method uses a single light source and an array of extremely small mirrors. The mirrors are on the size of \u00b5m in size, and is adjustable to either reflect light towards or away from a lens assembly, which increases the displayed picture. Short story, its a projector (Note there are non-DLP type projectors, that use LED screens to selectively block light. These type of projectors do NOT work for resin printing, as the LED screen filters a huge amount of the UV light needed for curing the resin).There are advantages and disadvantages to both methods, but lets just go over one (other wise I might end up rambling on forever!). The advantage to DLP print is cost! Its much cheaper then SLA, but limited by the projector resolution.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Some of the features of this design:-Quick removable vat-FlexVat design means no secondary action needed for peeling parts off vat. For example, the Form1 pulls the vat down on one side to peel parts off the vat. The FEP film used in a flexvat, being flexible, peels as it flexes. This film also has a much longer lifetime then standard vats, which means less often replacement of the vat.-Quick removable bed-Adaptable for use with any projector -Large vat allows for a large build area-Nice open area for easy access to components, for easier maintenance and modification-Opensource! All the design files are provided. (I did my best to keep them updated, but may have missed some updates)-------------------------------------------------------------------------------I know this is the moment most of you have been waiting for, so here it is. The cost of this build is roughly 400-500$ (NOT including projector), depending on what materials you use and extras you add. The reason I did not include the cost of the projector is because there are a TON of choices to pick from, anywhere from a cheap used one off Ebay of ~50$ to a brand new top of the line one that could run you 1000$+. Some projectors need modification, some dont. A good website to look at is http://www.buildyourownsla.com/forum/ . I used the Acer h6510bd, which current sells for ~550$. It will work pretty well right out of the box, with no modification needed (but can be improved with modification, if wanted).If you're still reading after seeing the cost, looks like your pretty serious!

As such, you will want to reduce the length of the tabs from 1/2\" to the thickness of the material you are using. (If necessary, I can provide the modified files to a set thickness. I suggest not going below 1/4\").For the Vat Plate you will need to add a 1/4\" Slot in the large U shaped opening. This is used to slide the vat in and secure it to the machine. In order to do this you will need a slot cutting bit, like this, and a hand or table router.

This includes 3 of the Corner_Brackets and the 1 Corner_Bracket_Projector, and lastly the Projector_Fan_Mount part. The 3 Corner_Brackets will use 3x M5x 30mm bolts and Nuts each, the Corner_Bracket_Projector 2x bolts/nuts, and the fan 2x bolt/nuts. Finish it off by bolting the fan with its fan shield onto the Projector_Fan_Mount with 4x M3x45 bolts and M3 Nuts.For the large pieces, I suggest starting off with the back piece. Insert the Vat_Plate first, followed by the two side pieces in conjunction with the Front_Brace. Lastly, insert the Bottom piece. Once all the pieces are fitted together, use wood screws between tabs to secure each piece together. Lastly, use 2 wood screws to secure the Vat_Plate to the Front_Brace.Before moving on, go ahead and drill out the 4 holes in the Vat_Plate. I used a 4.5mm drill bit, for #10 Thumb screws. This makes sure you can thread the wood using the thumb screws. These screws will ensure that your vat stays secured in the machine during printing.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Next, secure 4 of the Corner_Brackets to the Base using the same bolts/nuts used above (3 per piece, 12 total). Insert the 1/4\" bolts that came with the 1\" T-Nuts into the 3D printed parts as shown. You can now slide the 12\" Aluminum extrusions into the corner brackets. Loosely tighten each bolt so that the extrusions dont fall out, but not so tight so you cant flex them a little. Lastly, add two extra T-Nuts on the inside on each side, as shown. These will later be used to bolt the 16 3/4\" extrusions to the machine.This next part is a bit tricky. Add 1 extra T-Nut to each inside slot of the aluminum extrusions, as shown. Next, you will have to line up the 4 extrusions with the Corner_Brackets on the Bottom piece, and drop your 'box' on top of them. Once you do this, slide up the extra T-Nuts into the Corner_Bracket, and secure each using one of the 1/4\" bolts that came with them. Its suggested you lay the frame on its side to easily slide and align the T-Nuts. Flip the frame as you go for easy access to each T-Nut.Tighten all the bolts as necessary.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Finally!

Do a quick fit-up, and make sure the walls fit snugly in the channel as shown. After confirming they do, remove the walls from the channel. Next, add some acrylic cement in the channel, all around. Note that you don't have to fill the channel, even a small amount will work. Once you have put cement all around, insert the walls exactly like before, making sure they are pressed securely into to the channel. Finally, go ahead and add a nice heavy book or weight to the top, on top of all the walls, to make sure the walls stay firmly pressed into the channel while curing.Once these parts are cured, you will need to add some cement one at a time to each corner, as shown in the picture. This will finish up sealing the walls to each other, and ensure you don't get any leaks in your vat.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now that the part with all the acrylic cement is done, we can assemble the rest of the vat. First, place several M3x20 bolts in the bottom piece as shown. These will help to locate all the parts correctly. Slide a section of silicon gasket on each side and trim as necessary. Remove the silicon, place the FEP film on, then put the gaskets back on. Lastly, add the top piece with the vat walls glued on, as shown. Add some M3 nuts to the bolts, and loosely tighten them to make sure the vat doesn't fall apart when picking it up.Next, add M3x20 bolts + nuts every other hole as shown. You don't need much torque to tighten them, setting 1 on my Dewalt drill was more then enough to make sure the silicon was nice and tight between the film and the acrylic piece. Make sure the silicon joins up and seals at each corner, or you will get leaks. You should be able to tell easily through the acrylic whether you have a nice seal or not.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now your vat is nice and sealed, and ready to hold liquid. But the FEP film flexes, and we need to tension it so that it doesn't bend when the weight of the resin is added.First, use 4 screws to attach the 3D riser to the Vat_Base. You may need to use a few washers to ensure the screws dont poke through the 3D rsier. Next, use M3x45 bolts + nuts to attach assembled vat to Vat_Base. Make sure the bolts are oriented bottom to top as shown (Note vat is upside down in picture)! Loosely attach all the bolts needed. Next, you will want to tight each side, little by little, to keep them as even as possible, as you tension the FEP film. Its hard to say what the 'perfect' amount of tension is on the FEP film, but the best advice I can give that when you blow hard on the FEP film, you should get a nice hum out of it while blowing.Don't worry too much about over-tightening, as the FEP film can take a lot of abuse before breaking. The main goal is to make sure its tightened enough that adding some resin won't be enough to cause the film to flex from the weight.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------That's it for the vat! Go ahead and slide it into the Vat_Plate on the machine to make sure it fits right. It should fit nice and smoothly. If not, you will need to trim down the sides on the Vat_Base to make sure it slides in smoothly. Don't worry too much if its too loose, as the thumb screws you put in the Vat_Base earlier will ensure the Vat stays secured in the machine.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------On to testing it to make sure everything is A-Okay.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FKL/CK18/IN4QDDZB/FKLCK18IN4QDDZB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5B/74OG/IN944LL0/F5B74OGIN944LL0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEC/Z86Q/IN944LJ3/FECZ86QIN944LJ3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYA/PZPV/IN944LLI/FYAPZPVIN944LLI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1S/984N/IN944LLT/F1S984NIN944LLT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLG/UQJR/IN944LNW/FLGUQJRIN944LNW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQI/AI7J/INAJKJT6/FQIAI7JINAJKJT6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSW/W6LT/INAJKJT9/FSWW6LTINAJKJT9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4X/09G2/INAJKJX4/F4X09G2INAJKJX4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNI/ZGCF/INAJKKTE/FNIZGCFINAJKKTE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5Z/XGUO/INAJKJVI/F5ZXGUOINAJKJVI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPA/XVOQ/INAJKJVL/FPAXVOQINAJKJVL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW4/UTN7/INAJKJVM/FW4UTN7INAJKJVM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKV/MQCT/INAJKL9X/FKVMQCTINAJKL9X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8N/I9S6/INAJKLAK/F8NI9S6INAJKLAK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F50/1TRA/INAJKLP2/F501TRAINAJKLP2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBQ/6D4I/INAJKLJA/FBQ6D4IINAJKLJA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIX/1YKL/INAJKLTF/FIX1YKLINAJKLTF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFE/26J6/INAJKJZO/FFE26J6INAJKJZO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQI/TZP8/INAJKKFS/FQITZP8INAJKKFS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F86/3DR4/INAJKN1T/F863DR4INAJKN1T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNY/VPM1/INAJKNTD/FNYVPM1INAJKNTD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO2/HK80/INAJKNHY/FO2HK80INAJKNHY.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: The Vat - Gluing the Pieces and Assembly"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Now that you have the Vat fully assembled, the first thing to do is test it.

To do this you can refer to the OpenBuilds tutorial. The one substitute is if you would rather use a smaller NEMA 17 motor instead of buying the more expensive NEMA23 motor. For the NEMA17 motor, the motor will bolt to the 3D printed piece, which will then bolt to the C-Beam in the exact same way the NEMA23 motor would.On the C-Beam rail, remove the top plate from it so that you can slide it onto the frame. Add a minimum of 4 M5x20 bolts, with 2 washers each, through the holes on the side of the frame. Add a t-nut to each. Slide the beam onto the t-nuts, making sure to stop above the Vat_Plate with enough room to use a hex key to tighten the top plate on. Go ahead and add the top plate back on now. Finish off by making sure the beam is at a 90deg angle to vat plate, then tightening the M5x20 bolts to secure the beam to the rail. In this orientation, the motor is at the top. This allows for plenty of cooling, and gives you good access to the flexible coupler on the C-beam for easily moving the bed up and down manually.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now that you have the beam on, bolt the bed bracket onto the C-beam rail, using either M5x12 (sheet metal parts) or M5x20 (3D printed part). If you are use the sheet metal version, bolt the adapter plate on next.Lastly, loosen the thumb screw enough to slide onto the Bed_Bracket, and tighten.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------The nuts on the corners are for additional bolts. These led you adjust the corners of the bed down, so you can get the bed to be level with the vat. Tighten the bolt to lower that corner of the platform. The nylocks will prevent the bolts from moving when you take the bed off, maintaining a level printing surface.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQW/1F2Q/IN4QDGCY/FQW1F2QIN4QDGCY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAA/IM7Z/IN4QDS5H/FAAIM7ZIN4QDS5H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGD/0AS1/INBYZ2U3/FGD0AS1INBYZ2U3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 10: The Bed - Assembly and Mounting to Frame"}, {"step": 11, "steps_text": "3D printed files:-L_Brace.stl  x1 (Note file includes all 8 brackets required, 4 with a large hole 4 with a small hole)CNC router/Laser engraver: -h6510bd_Mount.dxf This file is for the h6510bd projector.

How does this work you ask?Well, the projector has two dials on the lens that let you focus the projector. This lets you change the size/focus a bit for when it normally is used in an office environment. In this case, it gives you some flexibility on your build area.The Acer used here is 1080p, meaning it has 1920x1080 pixels. How you divvy up these pixels is up to you.For instance, say you want a 150mmx100mm build area. 1920/150=12.8 pixels per mm. This means each pixel would represent 0.0781mm. This is your resolution, or 'accuracy' (not truly accuracy, but closest approximation). The remaining 1080 pixel side would then come out to 84.375mm. Your build area would be 150mmx84mmOn the other hand, say you want higher resolution. If you aim for 100mmx60mm build area, you would get 1920/100=19.2 pixels per mm. This would be 0.0521mm per pixel. This gives you a higher resolution then the previous, at the cost of a smaller build size. The 1080 side would be 56.25mm, giving you a build area of 100mmx56mm.Its really entirely up to you what size you want, as long as its within the limits of the vat size.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Go ahead a plug in your projector, and turn it on (make sure your vat is in the machine and tightened with thumbscrews so you can see the projected image). Once it fully boots up, you should see the projector logo pop up. For the Acer, if you hit the menu button, it will bring up a nice grid you can use to focus and size the projector.Using the explanation before, use a combination of sliding the projector up/down on the rail to change the size of the image, left/right to center the image, and the dials on the projector to focus the image. If you want an exact size, use a ruler to measure the image size.Once you have everything aligned, tighten all remaining bolts.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FGP/TYRO/IN4QDGDR/FGPTYROIN4QDGDR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF6/RP0Q/IN4QDGG8/FF6RP0QIN4QDGG8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSC/FG5A/IN4QDGED/FSCFG5AIN4QDGED.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 13: The Projector - Touch Up and Calibration"}, {"step": 14, "steps_text": "Only 2 simple 3D printed parts.

After all this time its finally time to work on some printing! I'M SO EXCITED!!!!Anyways, now that we have that out of our system, lets move on to working on some test prints.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------So, assuming you have read my instructable on how to use Creation Workshop (CW) and configuring your machine, its time to do some test runs. First, start with downloading a nice simple 20mmx20mmx10mm calibration cube.http://www.thingiverse.com/download:5839Now that we have that, go ahead and load it into CW. Depending on what resin you are using, you may need to adjust settings before hand in CW. See Appendix F for Resin documentation. Slice the 20mm calibration cube to get ready for printing.IMPORTANTBefore pouring resin into the vat, do a full test run with no resin. This is to ensure that your print does not encounter any issues during your run.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Go ahead and move your bed to just barely above the FEP film. Once done, plug in USB first, then 12V power. Then plug in your projector. Once done, connector to your machine.At this point, you should be in the following state:-No resin-Full connected to machine-Bed level with vat-File sliced and ready to print-Projector should be displaying a 'black' image.If you are in this state, go ahead and hit the play/print button! Your printer should start displaying image, and moving the bed up/down as needed. Again, make sure it does a full run before pouring resin in.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Once your machine has done a full run with no resin, and not encountered any issues, its FINALLY time to loud the resin. Most resins will need to be shaken to ensure its well mixed before pouring. Pour into Vat after mixing. You will probably need about 200mL of resin in the vat to print. Once this is done, DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU DID BEFORE. This is the entire reason you did the test print before! If everything goes well, you should be able to follow the previous steps, and get a relatively nice, 3D printed cube. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------If the cube is blobby/overcured or uncured, follow the CW tutorial and the step that refers to calibration for resins. If there are other issues, well, comment on this instructable and I'll do my best to help out.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Once you get a nice cube printed out, its time to do some fine tuning. Take a dial caliper and measure your 20mmx20mm cube, ensuring you know which is X and which is Y. Measure X side and Y side. You will then do X/20mm and Y/20mm. Take these values and multiply them by the existing X and Y values.EXAMPLE:Printed cube is 19.1mm x 18.9mm. Build area is currently set to 140mmx80mm.X dimension -140mm X (19.1mm/20mm) = 133.7mmY dimension - 80mm X (18.9mm/20mm) = 75.6mmThese are the new values you will input to Creation Workshop. Once doing so, it should adjust your machine to properly print a 20mmx20mm cube. Go ahead and save these settings, then print out another 20mmx20mm cube to make sure the settings made adjust the dimensions correctly.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Alrighty! You've done it! You got a sick, bad**** lookin printer that cranks out smooth looking, high definition printed parts!CELEBRATE!!!!!!!!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Alright, that's enough celebration.

There is always more to learn!", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 16: Print Time! - First Print and Some More Calibration"}, {"step": 17, "steps_text": "The first thing, above all, to keep in mind is this.I NEW TO THIS TOO. I dont have all the answers, but I'll do my best to answer any questions I can.With that said, here are some Tips, Tricks, and Things to keep in mind.-Every resin has different settings. Just as with FDM printing, every plastic has its own properties. The downside though here is that every resin manufacturer has different mixtures, and every machine has different power properties based on the projector. Expect to spend a fair amount of time tuning each resin you use.-Resin printing has a fair number more steps then FDM printing. With FDM printing, on a good machine, you can hit print and come back a few hours later with a part ready to use. Resin printing has several post-processing steps on the other hand. After printing, you want to do a pre-wash, main wash, then a UV oven curing. A look at the formlabs steps is a pretty good idea what is involved.http://formlabs.com/support/finishing/basic-finish...http://formlabs.com/support/finishing/post-curing-...-On my FDM printer, I can leave the plastic loaded, and print no problem the next day or week later. Resin printing on the other hand, the pigment starts to separate, and will need stirred. Good resins will take alot longer to separate (sometimes 24 hours or more) then the cheaper ones, but its always suggested you use a soft, rubber spatula or stirrer to give the resin a good mixing before you start printing. Separation also occurs while printing, so its not a great idea to do 12hr+ prints, as you may see near the end parts getting rougher due to UV bleed.-The Acer is a fairly decent projector for the price, and doesnt technically need any modification to get started. There are more expensive ones out there that are better, and cheaper ones that can be taken apart and modified. To call out the downside to the Acer, the image degrades near the edges as such a close up focus. This can be modified in you want 100% of the build area you have. This thread is a pretty good tutorial on how to do that.http://www.buildyourownsla.com/forum/viewtopic.php...http://imgur.com/a/FOgXW-Sometimes the UV output of the projector isnt 100% even. CreationWorkshop will let you fix this, but you first need to make a UV mapping of the output.

What about the sweet lookin' doors and roof and OMG those cool windows! What about those?!\" Fear not, we are going to cover that here. Since halogen, CFL, and LED lights used indoors tend not have alot of UV light content, the doors and roof are not absolutely necessary, if kept in a not well lit area. Halogen/CFL does emit some UV, while LED does not (Unless its a UV LED), so its highly suggested that you add doors and a roof to block any potential UV sources from accidentally curing the resin. Otherwise, you will want to keep it in a not well-lit area.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------You can add just about any type of door or roof you want, as shown in the pictures. My door is a double door, with magnetic latches, and some cool stickers, for a little extra coolness. My buddy wanted a porthole on his, and its a single door. Since you can do pretty much anything you want, I dont really have any files per say to attach here. Just measure the open area on the front, and cut to size whatever you want on the front!For the roof, if you go with a 250mm rail you dont need to worry about a notch in the roof. You can just measure the open area and cut a piece to size. If you wanted some extra build height, and decided to use the 500mm rail, You will need to make sure you add a notch in the roof for the rail.For the windows, attached is the 3D file for holding the windows. For cutting the windows out, just use the same vectors in the cutting the frame step, just scale down a little and only cut the window.

daughter\u2019s school I wanted to let the children each make a wind turbine. It wanted it to be functional, powering a small light and it needed to be cheaper than 6 Euro a piece, which ruled out any commercial kits.\r\nThe workshop was for 20 kids, which ruled out scavenging hard discs motors or stepper motors and such. Low cost \u201ctoy\u201d motors on the other hand need really high rpm to light up a small bulb or a led. Fortunately the type of motors used in solar cell driven toys and kits work better. And these are still available for under 2 Euro.\r\nA small flashlight bulb was actually easier to get to glow than lighting a LED, when driving a 6 to 1 gear on a \u201csolar grade\u201d motor by hand. But it required too much torque for a small and simple wind turbine.\r\nA LED worked with a turbine and a single step 6 to 1 gearing, but only at really high wind speeds, needed to get a high enough voltage. But I wanted the kids see it functioning, without having to wait for a strong wind. To apply a higher gear ratio in one step needed a larger gear wheel which I could not find at a low price. A two step gearing gives to much friction with the cheap and simple construction techniques suitable for a kids workshop (remember we are talking about gearing up, which is more critical to build quality).\r\nBut our good friend the Joule Thief came to the rescue. With this little circuit added, the LED lights up at a breeze. Moving the wind turbine by hand easily lights up the LED. I estimate it starts at wind speeds below 10km/h. And everything still holds up at strong winds.\r\nApart from attaching leads to the motor/generator in advance (\u201csolar\u201d motors are often sold with leads anyway) the circuit is built up without soldering, as I prefer to avoid that when working with 20 kids aged 6 to 12.\r\nAll that was left was making some \u201ctemplates\u201d for the steps that need accuracy and gathering the materials and I was ready for the workshop. Check the result in the video below and read how we built the wind turbines in this Instructable.\r\n\r\nMy special thanks goes to Emma, for her assistance when taking extra pictures showing the detailed construction steps.\r\nThanks for the votes for this entrie in the MakerBot Challenge!", "title": "Mass Producing LED Powering Wind Turbines in a Kids Workshop", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Junior-Wind-Turbine/", "section": "home", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "For the turbine and tail vane:\n1 piece of 2mm thick balsa 10 cm by 40 cm or 4 pieces 10 cm by 10 cm\n4 bamboo (meat) skewers 30 cm long, about 3mm diameter\nsome cellotape, at least 19mm wide\nsuperglue\nlarge gear (about 60 mm diameter, Opitec part 840088)\na piece of scrap wood, 3 cm thick and about 6 cm by 6cm in size.\nsome non-stick paper,\n1 small stick of hotmelt glue (low temp type when working with kids)\na cabinet screw with an unthreaded part, fitting loosely the gear hole (4mm for the gear mentioned above), about 35 mm long.

This means first some drilling has to be done. All holes are 3 mm\r\nOnly one hole needs to be in an accurate position from one other, the others holes are not critical. First the hole for the motor/generator mount is drilled about 5 cm from and goes completely through. The motor/generator mount is attached with a bolt and nut. There's a little trick to that: first the mount is attached hand tight, with the curve of the metal following the curve of the tube. When it is twisted to its final position the spring metal provides tension, locking the assembly into place.\r\nNow comes the critical hole. It needs to be drilled perpendicular to the first one, and at a distance along the tube determined by the gears and motor/generator used (18 mm with the Opitec parts mentioned above). The motor/generator mount can be bent a little to adjust for small errors, but taking care with this drilling will avoid this. Therefore a template fitting the tube and motor/generator mount was made as shown.

Now an arcade game costume is pretty cool on its own, but one you can actually play is infinitely better wouldn't you say? So here I will do my best to explain how I made mine. I got lucky in that I had the perfect sized boxes to work with and that someone had done a similar thing so I had something to get me started. The basic idea for the working parts came from this great BMO costume 'ible: https://www.instructables.com/id/Playable-BMO-costu...   So be sure to go check that out and give some props!Basically, this costume is made from cardboard and hot glue. You will also need spray paint (white and yellow), a box cutter and scissors, a computer and printer, card stock, spray adhesive, a plastic shopping bag, glue stick, black, red, and orange paint, and a paint brush.For the working components you will need a plug and play pacman game. You can usually find these pretty cheap at a dollar store. You also need a small battery powered projector. I used the same one suggested in the BMO ible, a Jakks pacific eye clops like this one http://www.ebay.com/itm/Eyeclops-Mini-LED-Projecto...and batteries for the projector. You will also need a mirror.Also see our Pacman cosutme: https://www.instructables.com/id/Pacman-Adventures-...and our Metal Pacman costume: https://www.instructables.com/id/Metal-Pacman-Costu...", "title": "Playable Pacman Arcade Game Costume", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Playable-Pacman-Arcade-Game-Costume/", "section": "home", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "So before you can really get started, you have to have a tentative plan and know general sizes needed.Gather some reference photos to work from.

This will tell you how large to make your body compartment which is the base for the whole thing. Or you could just find a box that you fit in comfortably and screw the numbers mess. The rest of the build is built onto this so this is the foundation.I happened to have the perfect box. It fit me great with plenty of room without having too much space and making the build bigger than it needed to be.Break down your box and remove any tape that may still be on it. Cut off the end of the box where you feet will be. Now take your box and any other cardboard you think you will be using outside and give them a nice coat with cheap white spray paint. This will save you time and money later when you need to paint it yellow. That cardboard really soaks up the paint making you need to apply more layers and yellow spray paint can get expensive. I recommend having a layer of white on any cardboard you use for this build. It is much easier to do that BEFORE you build it. I learned the hard way.Anyways, once the paint has dried, bring it back to your work area and find the center of the panel where your head will be. Draw or trace a circle there large enough four head to comfortably fit through. I traced a medium sized mixing bowl. Then carefully cut the hole out.Now build your box back up and tape it with wide masking tape. I say masking tape because it is the best tape to paint over. I initially taped it with duct tape and it didn't hold well so I switched to masking tape.Try the fit. Make sure the head hole is good for you. If you are good, we need arm holes next.We are going to trace another circle in the middle of each side panel at about 4 and a quarter inches from the top of the box. Carefully cut these out and add some tape to the seams.Try the fit again. I found, later on in the build, that the arm holes were not comfortable for me. They needed to be more oval shaped so I had to go back and draw an oval around the circle and cut it out again. Then I traced the piece I just cut off on the other side to make it even.* you will notice that I did not spray paint the side panels. This if because we are going to add panel later that will cover this part up, so no use in wasting paint.*", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FG8/7NO0/I1OTZBO9/FG87NO0I1OTZBO9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCE/1B04/I1OTZBQQ/FCE1B04I1OTZBQQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAW/7PWK/I1OTZBUH/FAW7PWKI1OTZBUH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHS/W06D/I1OTZBT7/FHSW06DI1OTZBT7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOR/H8B7/I1OTZBVP/FORH8B7I1OTZBVP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI9/8YD6/I1OTZBYC/FI98YD6I1OTZBYC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAT/0BIR/I1OTZC0Y/FAT0BIRI1OTZC0Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1V/DSBG/I1OTZC27/F1VDSBGI1OTZC27.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIA/1EK5/I1OTZC60/FIA1EK5I1OTZC60.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQQ/SO68/I1OTZCM9/FQQSO68I1OTZCM9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPR/2O24/I1OTZCMB/FPR2O24I1OTZCMB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWF/3FY5/I1OTZCOS/FWF3FY5I1OTZCOS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9E/0UPO/I1OTZCQ0/F9E0UPOI1OTZCQ0.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: The Body Compartment"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Let's get out housing box started.I used a double cereal box from Sams to house my components.Cut off one of the larger panels.The game will plug into the projector and the battery pack will plug in as well.

You can see, I didn't paint the side panels and had to do it later when it was all built, no bueno.Get your plastic shopping bag and cut off the handles. Then cut along the seams on the sides and bottom. This leaves you with the back panel of the bag which has no writing and the front panel which does (useless).

Put a line of glue along the edge of one side of the screen opening and align the bag on top. This will hold the bag in place while you secure it.Cut strips of scrap cardboard. Put hot glue along the length of it and place the strip across the plastic bag along the edge of the screen opening. Make sure that the strip touches the cardboard on both ends because the hot glue can melt the bag.Next do the side of the screen opposite the one you just did.

So I bought a foam block at walmart for under $1. Cut off a bit on the end and push the projector into it, This will give it a stable surface.Set up your mirror and put your battery pack right on the edge of the open end, with the projector right in front of it.I tried many different configurations, but this is the one that worked.Turn it all on and grab your screen. hold your screen so that the bottom panel is sitting on the projector housing box near the open end of it.

The bottom flap of the screen should not move, you should just be able to tilt the screen forward and backward.If the angle of your mirror has changed, mark it.

Use tape to secure the projector and battery pack as well as you can.Now we need to make our housing box a bit sturdier before we attach the screen.

This is what I came up with: a quick and cheap design that went from design, fabrication and installation in under 1.5 hours.  In this instructable, I walk through how you might make a similar projector mount in a similarly cheap and timely manner.  As for tools, I recommend using a laser cutter to make your acrylic mount plate.  If you don't have access to one, try joining your local makerspace.  I've recently been using our makerspace's laser cutter for a very wide range of projects due to the cheapness of materials, the precision of the tool, and the short time between design and production.  I'll also discuss other options to laser cutters for those who don't have access to one.  In addition to a laser cutter, you'll need a 2D Vector or CAD software.  I recommend Vectorworks (free), Autocad (free for students) and Solidworks (quite expensive).  A hand drill and drill bits is also a good tool to have for this.  Tools required:Laser cutter (recommended but optional)2D CAD or vector softwareHand drillTape measureTypically, you want to ALWAYS complete your design before buying your parts.  This however assumes that every part you may want, you can find a detailed spec. sheets for on the internet.

A tape measure will get you reasonably accurate measurements.  Determine which side of the bracket will be against the wall and and which is against will be supporting the projector platform.  Place the wall side down against a table and measure the hole locations (of the platform portion) up from the table surface.  Unfortunately, your measurements won't be perfect (like the dimensions you have for the projector mount holes).  To compensate, we'll make the hole diameters on the platform bigger than we need so alignment need not be perfect.  Third, create a rough layout of everything on a sheet of paper.  Place all of the holes (projector mount and shelf bracket) as well as the outline of each part.  Make sure you give a few inches between the projector and the wall for cables (video and power).  Once your are satisfied, draw all of this up in your CAD software.  I've included images and my CAD file to assist your in your design.

Your appliances will have a label which indicates the power consumption. (If the Amperage draw is listed, wattage is calculated by multiplying volts and amps, 1 Amp at 120VAC=120 Watts). For example if your laptop charger uses 80 Watts, and your phone charger uses 20W, we need an inverter rated for at least 150W. Blenders typically use 300W, so to power a blender, laptop and charge a phone you would need an inverter rated for 500W or more.

Now as some of you may know I made a wind generator before and got a lot of good feedback. Now in the old one I left it up to you to decide what you wanted to do with the energy it put out. But not this time! If you were a little stuck or didn't know what to do with the energy I will be showing you how to turn wind into light! This is built using recycable material, giving trash new life!How does it work? The wind catchers catch the wind and rotate, while rotating it turns a stepper motor which acts as our generator. The stepper motor outputs around .6 volts to maybe a full 1volt, depending on how windy it is. That energy is then rectified to dc and stored in a nickle based rechargeable battery(what is stored is what is outputed). The energy stored in the battery is then toggled on by a swtich and runs through a joule theif. The joule theif takes the low voltage and steps it up enough to power 5 white leds.\u00a0what are some factors to consider? There can be a few. One factor to consider is the stepper motor, you want one that is easy to turn and that can output at least half a volt at a slow RPM rate. It is best to test your motor before building this. Since the wind (another factor) isn't as consistent as the power coming out of your wall it is also hard to give an accurate charge time. In my area winter kinda came early this year bringing some strong winds, which works out well for this build.\u00a0 So in short there are two factors really, the wind and the specs of your motor. All stepper motors are different. Some are hard to turn and some are easy, some output a decent voltage and some don't.\u00a0 Lets get things started by first watching a video of this in action! view the next step for the video.", "title": "How to Make a Wind Generated Light Bulb.

This helps them become more durable.\u00a0 3- hot glue the four sticks wrapped in tape spaced out around your CD 4- mount the pop bottle tops on the sticks. This is easily done by making two notches in the top of the bottle and securing with hot glue. Be sure to cover up any space in the mouth of the bottle to prevent any air from pushing through and be sure to have them all facing in the same direction.\u00a0 5- optional. Hot glue another CD over it to add a bit more strength. 6- attach the stepper motor. I used a bottle cap to do this step.

Solder all the leads and trim them if needed. In a full bridge rectifier there are four connection points. two of those points are ac input and the other two are dc output with polarity.

Well We use both these energy to produce a usable energy.Or it can be a Nuclear. which is beyond in this project/experiment.EVEN EARTHS HEATTTTTTTTT (GEOTHERMAL ENERGY).A raw Mechanical input can be directly coupled to electrical generator. But as you may observe, Electrical generators may work on physical conditions that may require a both high or low RPM to produce a usable energy, it depends on how designers design what the machine will produce. It can be A low RPM generator but can produce a high voltage and low current, It can be a high RPM generator that produce a low voltage and high current, It can be Both Voltage and current to produce High outputs but in low RPM and Vice-Versa. A good Example is a Wind Turbine Generator. Wind turbine generators are designed to turn the blades even if the wind is not that moderate or even it can turn the blades  even its not windy. You may always notice that wind turbines if you can observe closely. Yep the blades are faster in rotating speed because it is the farthest in the center, but in the center of those rotating blades you seem that the center is not rotating that much. But How Wind Generators produce electricity even it is not rotating that much??.Well The answer isMechanical Transmission. Just like a vehicle. Car as a Vehicle have a mechanical transmission, You notice that Car Engines can produce High RPM but we only need to provide in our wheels to output at a certain/specific rotational speed so we designed the transmission to convert mechanical rotational speed at a certain level. But in a Wind turbine is a reverse analogy in a car transmission. We Convert Low RPM to HIGH RPM why? Simply because Nowadays electrical generators require a high RPM to produce a certain/specific amount of usable energy. or in the other hand Because of the Establishment how or what is the electrical standards already established.

It may vary on how you pick the motor/generator, other motors can  be easily play (Mechanical to Electrical)other motors may require a conversion before it became a generator.)

This is perfect for indoor and outdoor architectural railings, or outside on your\u00a0motorcycle frame, bicycle frame, roof racks, or anywhere that needs some extra bling, dazzle, visibility, spark, or shine. You will need a good quality,\u00a0non waterproof LED Strip, \u00a0protection rating of \u00a0IP20, contact cement (optional), masking tape (optional), a fine line\u00a0permanent\u00a0marker or sharp pointed tool, 1\"\u00a0fibreglass\u00a0ribbon,\u00a0fibreglass\u00a0resin, body filler (Bondo), a plastic\u00a0yoghurt\u00a0tub or similar plastic (for your spreader/shaper).", "title": "Installing LED Strip on Round Frame, Railing, or Tube", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Installing-LED-Strip-on-Round-Tubing/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Best way to accurately position your new strip, once you have decided where to mount it, \u00a0is to draw or scratch a guide line that you can follow with one edge of the LED strip, this will minimize handling and over working the delicate flexible PC board. Attach the LED Strip using the adhesive back to hold it in place before applying the 1\u201d wide\u00a0fibreglass\u00a0ribbon which runs along the length of the LED strip. Prepare surfaces with a solvent that evaporates quickly but first, make sure it\u00a0doesn't\u00a0attack your existing finishes. Leave the end contacts exposed for final connecting and sealing . Masking off the area where the strip will adhere and then painting or spraying contact cement on will give an exceptional bond when combined with the strip\u2019s adhesive. Take care however, because repositioning will be a problem once it grabs. When applying the LED strip - first, peel the backing paper back about 2 inches and press the strip into place, next, put a bit of \u00a0tension on the LED strip holding it about a foot from the adhesion point while applying it and peeling back the paper backing, 2-4 inches at a time, apply good pressure with a finger every 1/2 inch or so. \u00a0Make sure the adhesive has grabbed, this will assure an even line of LEDs and provides the best heat transfer, which will help extend their performance. Never just peel the LED strip off once it has bonded to a surface, instead use a thin scraper or dull blade and slide it between the bonded surfaces while lifting the LED strip away and minimize distorting it. When applying the fibreglass, the best results can be had by brushing the resin onto the strip/pipe area before applying the\u00a0fibreglass\u00a0then brushing another coat over the ribbon once it\u2019s been applied. A small 1/2\" disposable paint brush works well to dab out any air bubbles and ensure good fibreglass contact over the LEDs. The second photo shows the set resin and\u00a0fibreglass\u00a0ribbon, this strip used here is the 3528 LED with 60 pcs. per meter. It is about 2mm high and 8mm wide.

We did an initial coat, let it set then applied a final smoothing coat. The first application of Bondo can be shaped with coarse sandpaper or a blade as it sets up, but \u00a0avoid contacting the LEDs. Start with a teaspoon size amount at one end and wrap your flexible spreader over the LED strip/pipe and \u2018pull\u2019 it along, holding it at a 45 degree angle so the Bondo is contained and forced into the low points. As it flows on it should create small mounds where each LED is and the LEDs should remain visible. Tighter angle results in smaller mounds and a flatter line.

I haven't verified this, but a rough calculation suggests that the lights should run for about 4 hours on two CR2016 batteries, which is sufficient for a weigh-in and race. The goal was to add front, back and roof LEDs to the car. My son wanted the roof lights to flash in an alternating pattern (that is, one on when the other is off, and vice versa). The simplest solution that I could see was to use a microcontroller. I could have used flashing LEDs, but they wouldn't be synchronized. I could have used a 555 timer and an inverter, but this would increase the part count. I also wanted to strobe the LEDs to lengthen battery life and use the duty cycle to equalize brightness in some way. So, it just had to be a microcontroller. Besides, a Pinewood Derby car with a computer inside - how cool is that? The total cost of parts for this project probably amounts to less than $10 or so. However, you need to be familiar with programming a microcontroller (the wonderful ATtiny2313). I use the avrdude/avr-gcc toolchain on Linux with a USBtinyISP programmer fromhttp://ladyada.net . I used a programming cradle (see https://www.instructables.com/id/Ghetto-Development-Environment/ for example) to connect the programmer to the microcontroller. The electronic parts used in the car were: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1x ATtiny2313 ($2.88) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2x 5mm white LED ($1.72) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2x 5mm yellow LED ($0.64) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2x 5mm red LED (don't remember, probably $0.10 or less) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 wirewrap hookup wire (two colors so the LEDs are connected with correct polarity) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ShapeLock (aka Friendly Plastic) to fashion a battery holder \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2x ring connectors for battery terminals \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2x CR2016 coin batteries ($1.17) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2x 20 pin DIP sockets (one split in half to simplify hooking up the ground connections) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1x tiny switch (I used a SPDT, $0.75) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1x diode to drop supply voltage below 5.5V (I used a zener in the 'wrong' direction) The total of the known prices is less than $8.00, but it would be a bit misleading to characterize this as a $10 project! I used the 20 pin DIP ATtiny2313 because I had it in my box. There are many alternatives, the only consideration is space. If my soldering skills were up to it (they're not), a SMD version would be cool. The code is written in C, and is fairly straightforward. Working with interrupts is often a bit delicate for timing reasons, but in this case a 1mS interrupt rate gives plenty of time to perform the tasks at hand. Most of my coding time was spent figuring out the correct timer/interrupt setup. (However, I should point out that I have been coding for many years, and have a lot of experience dealing with this sort of project.) Among other things, you will need a programmer for the ATtiny2313. Fast debugging was helped significantly by my prehistoric (but functional) 4 channel 300Mhz Tektronix scope. Soldering iron, solder, wire snips, wire stripper, solder sucker, wire of various sorts and a breadboard for experiments all help too. A good tweezers and double sided Scotch mounting tape (I like the mounting squares) are almost indispensable. I am no expert in woodworking, so I have no contribution in this regard. I am, however, an expert in finding overly complex solutions to simple problems, and in using delicate and intensely complicated solution techniques. In this regard I can be of great help. The project took a lot longer than I intended, mainly because (1) the hookup wire I used (wire wrap) was very brittle and (2) soldering the connections in the spaghetti mess of wires stretched my limited soldering skills. Most of the relevant instructable information is contained in the image notes on the pictures. I split the steps into the woodworking part, the (electronics) hardware, the software and the assembly (by far the hardest part for me). Hopefully we will win some category of the Pinewood Derby :-).

My initial tendency\nwas to aim for perfection of some sort (not that I could achieve it), which would have\nspoiled the fun. Luckily I got sense and chilled out.\nI used a 1/2\" wood chisel to hollow out space for the wires, battery and microcontroller. I was\nlucky with my size guess. This was a little challenging for me (see picture) as the pine kept\nsplitting unexpectedly. Take care not to get too close to the sides or the axle slots.

Coin cells seemed like\nan obvious choice. Since the white LEDs have a turn-on of about 3.2V, and coin batteries\nmostly come in multiples of 1.5V this meant that we needed at least 4.5V. This would mean\n3 batteries, which was getting messy. So, I decided that two 3V batteries would do.\nThe Wiki entry http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_battery_sizes has some useful\ninformation (assuming its correct!). A CR2016 is exactly half the thickness of a CR2032,\nso I decided on using 2xCR2016. I initially thought I could use a sewable CR2032 coin\nbattery holder (from http://www.sparkfun.com ) and double-up the batteries, but when it\narrived I realized that it would short out one of the batteries. So, I settled on the less-than-\nsatisfactory method of fashioning our own. I used two ring terminals (with insulation\nremoved) and ShapeLock wrapped around the two cells. This worked fine. The CR2016\nhas about 90mAh according to the Wiki.\nAnother issue was that the microcontroller has a maximum operating voltage of 6V (seehttp://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc2543.pdf ) and lithium cells\nhave a higher than nominal open circuit voltage (see the Wiki entry above ), so it seemed\nprudent to lower the operating voltage slightly. I used a diode in series with the supply to\nget a 0.7V drop or so. (A quick worst case computation shows that the maximum current\nwould be around 100mA, so the diode must be rated for at about 100mW, which is not\nan issue unless you are using really tiny diodes.) I used a Zener in the 'wrong' direction\nsince I have lots of them.\nThe Atmel spec. (see link above) is pretty clear as specs. go. The ATtiny2313 has fuses\nthat allow you to choose some operating characteristics such as using an internal clock\nand operating frequency. The next section shows how to program the fuses with the avr\ntoolchain.\nI chose to run the ATtiny2313 at 1Mhz, which is more than fast enough for our needs,\nand at this frequency the active supply current is about 2mA, which is pretty negligible\ncompared to the LED draw. Other relevant ATtiny2313 characteristics are (1) the maximum\nDC current per I/O pin (40mA), (2) the maximum DC current through power and ground\n(200mA) and (3) the I/O pin HI voltage at the relevant LED current (4.5V @ 20mA, 4.8V @\n10mA).\nA quick sanity check shows that there are no gross violations of the spec: The white and\nyellow LEDs are rated at 20mA, the red LED is rated at 10mA. So, the worst case current is\nabout (4*20+2*10) mA for LEDS, and about 2mA for the ATtiny2313, so a worst case of\nabout 102mA. So all seems fine from a spec. point of view.\nHowever, at a draw of 102mA, the CR2016s will last less than an hour. This is not sufficient\nas there may be an hour or more delay between Pinecar Derby weigh-in and the actual race.\nSo I decided to schedule the LEDs to use less current (using a lower duty cycle) and to switch\non at different times. This will be dealt with in the next section.\nA current limiting resistor should be used so the LEDs operate at the appropriate point.\nThe appropriate resistor value can be computed using the formula below. The relevant LED\ncharacteristics are the forward (on) voltage, V_f_min, and the on current, I_on. Below V_f_min,\nthe LED is not turned on, and there is no point in driving more current than I_on (it won't get\nmuch brighter, battery power is wasted and the LED life is cut short, not that the latter is a\nbig consideration here). V_HI is the I/O pin output HI voltage when sourcing current I_on.\nThe resistor value doesn't need to be exact, of course, and the final choice will depend on\nwhat you have in your box (I have a resistor kit that has gazillions of different values), and\nwhat the actual brightness looks like (remember, the car just has to light up for a few\nhours, we're not manufacturing a million units!). Furthermore, since the duty cycle will\nbe less than 100%, smaller resistor values can work. I made a mistake when I looked up\nthe yellow forward voltage on the spec. and used a resistor value of 100 ohms instead of\nthe 'correct' 135 ohms. Not a big deal, just a bit sloppy on my part (since I've gone to the\nbother of computing the value in the first place!). The second picture below shows the\nrelevant numbers for the LEDs and the I/O pin HI voltage vs. source current.\nI used a bread board (see third picture below) to make sure all was well, and to let me\ntest the software before assembly. One minor thing to watch out for: I choose to use\nPORTB (don't remember exactly why, it might have been so I could verify the internal\nclock frequency on another pin), which overlaps with the programming pins. So, you\nwill need to disconnect one of the LEDs (pin 17, I think) when programming the unit,\nor you may hit some odd programming errors.

This gives about a thousand\ncycles (the compiler will save/restore registers on interrupt, so there are less than a thousand)\nbetween interrupts. This should be adequate for any reasonable light flashing schedule!\nYou need to read the spec. carefully to setup the timer and interrupts. Remember to enable\ninterrupts in the main loop. The spec. link is http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc2543.pdf .\nThe first image below shows the staggered turn-on times for each LED and the duty cycles\nfor each. To make life simple, I decided to use a 16mS period, so the duty cycle can be set\nto any of the values n/16, with n=1,...,16. A variable count_ms is incremented every time\nthe interrupt routine finished. I chose 16 because I can just mask off the bottom 4 bits\nof count_ms to figure out where we are in the duty cycle period. The data structure Led\n(see the .h files below)\u00a0 indicates the staggered start time for each LED, and how long it\nshould remain on.\nI have some additional code to alternate the yellow LEDs, so at most one yellow LED\nis on at any time. The variable slow_count toggles every 256mS, about a quarter of a\nsecond.\nUsing the first picture below, you can figure out the maximum and average total LED current.\nThe average draw (including the microcontroller) is about 22mA, which gives about 4 hours\nof light. Since the maximum draw is only 42mA, there is no need for a capacitor across the\npower supply (to suppress switching transients).\nI adjusted the on-times so the brightness of each LED was about the same. The yellow\nand red LEDs have diffusers, the white LED has a lens, which works out somewhat like\na real car. The white LEDs were very bright. There is a slightly visible flicker (at 1000/16 Hz),\nbut it is tolerable, and draws attention when the car moves.\nA multi-channel scope makes easy work of debugging. I'm not sure how I would have found\nmy bugs otherwise. There is actually a subtle bug in the code, but it doesn't matter in that\nit is a corner case that is irrelevant. If the pulse_on_time is set to 0, then the corresponding\nLED will stay on all the time! The fix is to also check that a LED is turned on only if the\nvalue of pulse_on_time is non-zero.

I used wire wrap wire which was the smallest insulated wire I could find. It is\nvery brittle and makes soldering leads very time consuming (for me). (I might have been\nbetter off actually wire wrapping instead of soldering.)\nInspired by 'Blinkenlights' (https://www.instructables.com/id/Ghetto-Development-Environment ),\nI soldered the relevant resistors onto the cathode of the LED (doesn't matter, just helps if\nyou are consistent so you don't get mixed up later). I soldered the wire-wrap wire onto the\nsuitable trimmed anode and resistor leads. Then I used heat shrink tubing (of different sizes)\nto cover the exposed metal and add some strength. Then I inserted the leads and threaded\nthem through to the inside cavity. I used some polystyrene glue to fix the LEDs in position.\nThe result was a spaghetti mess of brittle leads.\nNext I soldered the anode leads to the appropriate pin on a 20 pin DIP socket. This was\ntough, as the socket plastic melts readily, and the neighboring pin tends to heat fast,\nundoing your previous work. I connected the switch to the batteries, and added the voltage\ndropping diode wrapped in heat shrink tube.\nIn the previous step, I managed to ruin one DIP socket with too much heat. I was able to\nsalvage one side of it to serve as a 'ground plane'. I wired all the pins together, and soldered\nthe LED, microcontroller and battery ground leads into the socket side. This used up some\nprecious space, but saved my sanity (what little I have).\nThen I crammed all the stuff into the cavity. I broke a few connections doing this, so I\nresoldered and was more careful the next time. I used a small square of double sided\nScotch mounting tape to attach the switch to the side. The attachment is a bit spongy,\nepoxy would have been better, but its sufficient. (See the second picture below.)\nAt this stage I was able to test the close to final car. See the third picture, you can see the\nwhite & red LEDs and one of the alternating yellow LEDs. (You can also see my copy of\nHungerford's Algebra which is pretty incomprehensible to my engineering mind :-)).\nTo keep the guts from falling out, I cut some tin from the bottom of a chocolate box we\ngot as a present. This was pretty difficult, I went through a few Dremel cutting disks before\nI finished. You need to smooth the edges carefully so that little hands don't get cut. You\nneed to remember to make some room for the switch. I cut mine in the wrong place, but\nthe switch is easy to reposition. I drilled two holes and attached the bottom with two tiny\nwood screws I found. I printed out a piece of paper indicating on/off to make the bottom\nlook a little prettier.\nI used Gorilla super glue to add some washers. The car weighs about 4.5 oz. after adding\nthe washers. Still a little light, but that will be fine. Yes, I know the ratio of air drag to gravity\nis not optimal, but as my brother says, \"the enemy of good is better\". And he knows.\nFinally, and by far the most important step, we added some decals. The dry transfer decals\nwere expensive (about $3.50), but worked amazingly well. (Shown in the first picture of\nthe Intro.)\nWe're both very proud of our car :-). Even if we don't win (but we might).\nFeel free to ask questions, I would be happy to elaborate (if I can).P.S. We won the Coolest Car in the Pack trophy! And there were lots of really cool cars\nthere. Thanks to the amazing folks who ran the event.

Remember - All the  12v can come from the same source, so you can run (one) 1 wire from the Battery to the ear, then connect all the (LED1)'s Anodes to that same bus.\u00a0\u00a0 the decision to light or not light is made by the Relay connecting the ground...... and on that note - all the 2 led arrays in one Row, can be connected together.\u00a0 I ended up with 10 leads from each ear (one for each row - heading to each of the 10 relays) and 1 lead going to each Ear to provide  12 volts.\u00a0 so just because I have 160 arrays i only have 22 wires (not 320) coming into the head - and i connect Row 1 from the left ear, and Row1 from the right ear - so only one (1) wire going into the relay. same with the LEFT and RIGHT  12v, connect those to make only one wire going to the Positive terminal of the Battery. The other connections: the Relay needs to know what the 12v ground is, so each Relay needs a connection to the 12v ground as well (i feel like that should be part of the PCB but it's not... then the Trigger  5 volts for each Relay needs a pin on the arduino I also found that the Relay board will power  5 volts to the Arduino - so you don't need a separate 5v or 9v supply to power the arduino, just let the relay board power the arduino!\u00a0 lastly make some room in the ear for the microphone.\u00a0 those 3 wires will need to get feed into the head and wired up to the arduino.\u00a0 the microphone I got said to use between 2v and 5v\u00a0 since it needs a steady current to be accurate - connect the  3v from the arduino to the microphone. ground it, and then you have a signal wire from the mic - that will be your analog in pin. now get to soldering!

I put the washers on each side after it cracked, but that would be a good security step before drilling as well. Drill the holes in the globe and hard hat - bigger than the rod, not the same size.\u00a0 my holes were such a tight fit i had to twist the rod into both the globe and hard hat.\u00a0 if you use washers and nuts on each side of the globe / hat - the hole the rod is going through can be a little bigger.... this will save some time and headaches After drilling the holes on the globe where the rod will attach the ears - I pushed in the rod and got a better idea where those rods would hit the hard hat. marked those positions with a sharpie and drilled the holes in the hard hat.\u00a0 This really was more art that science, sure you could dust off the Trig from High school - but i eyeball'ed it and it worked pretty good.\u00a0\u00a0 the hat ended up a little askew (so when i am looking straight ahead - deadmau is looking slightly to the left) but I can deal with that.\u00a0 learn from my mistakes.... thats why i am doing this. Cut out the mouth.\u00a0 I used a dremel with a basic cutting wheel.\u00a0 steady hands are key - you can't really use a ruler to make sure you are following the line. same for making the hole in the globe bottom - big enough to get your head in.... I put a fan in the top as well... just a quite computer case fan, they run off 12v so that was a no brainier to keep it cool in that head. air will flow through the pantie hose (ok) a little air flow will help a lot if you plan to wear this for any amount of time. last hole you need are for the led wires.\u00a0 just in-between the threaded rod holes. ----------------------------------------------------- Paint the globe black......\u00a0 why did you get a clear globe if you are going to paint it?\u00a0 well the pantie hose idea was after I got the clear globe, and i a trying to minimize how many holes i cut into the acrylic to save as much structural integrity as i can.\u00a0\u00a0 after you got the mouth - it is pretty fragile. you can super glue (or hot glue) some braces in like I did - too firm up the mouth and keep it from cracking. anyway - mask off the eye leds = and spray paint the rest black.\u00a0 this will give a black color behind the sheering pantie hose covering.\u00a0 if you get a white globe - you can cut out holes for the eye leds, but you will still need to paint it black - or your head will look like black pantie hose stretched over a huge while ball...Lips:\u00a0 I used this gym mat to add depth to the acrylic where the mouth is, cut to fit, hot glue in place. (the hot glue works really well on this acrylic)Eyes:\u00a0 I put 2 Blue LEDs in each eye.\u00a0 I hot glued them inside the globe,\u00a0 I did not drill out the acrylic (a good reason to use the clear globe - the light will go through.\u00a0 the hot glue helps diffuse the light so it looks like the eye is blue not like there are two blue lights inside the eye.\u00a0 but the eye globes were white.\u00a0 I have seen people use clear globes for the eyes.\u00a0 but then you have to sand the acrylic to make them white - or coat with some tracing paper to diffuse the leds... my system is pretty good i think. Hot glue the while domes on the outside of the clear head.\u00a0Fan: hot glue in place (from the inside) so the outside still appears round. You can connect all the wires for the eyes and fan together - they will just be on all the time the system is on. (i wired them into a switch i mounted on the hard hat.... so I could turn it off - without disconnecting the battery.Cover the globe:\u00a0 this will be tricky - pull over the entire head.\u00a0 using hot glue and patients - cut around the eyes, and use glue to hold in place.\u00a0 same for teeth (attach the hose to the inside of the lip - mouth will be easier than eyes.)Teeth:\u00a0 I tried to make teeth out of some hangers - it did not work..... i did not have time to resolve that issue - I decided to just cut two \"buck teeth\" .... a good solution - still considering it... it did make conversation with other easier, but it does show a good part of your face if you are trying to hide that...Attaching the ears: after your leds are soldered in place, and the back and front are covered.\u00a0 wrap in hose, then slide over the threaded rod.\u00a0 if you want to glue them down you can but that will make it pretty much impossible to take the ears off to store without ruining the hose at a minimum. *post build note:\u00a0 I glued the crap out of those ears...... i choose durable rather than easy to store! lessons learned: Mask over the inside of the Eye LEDs..... the reflection back into the head - made it really hard to see \"out\" you need it dark inside this head!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FG5/UYR1/HNE3XZZK/FG5UYR1HNE3XZZK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0U/FR6M/HNE3ZL1A/F0UFR6MHNE3ZL1A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMH/P54Q/HNE3PXR7/FMHP54QHNE3PXR7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE5/IT41/HNE3UWO1/FE5IT41HNE3UWO1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIZ/U599/HNE3XZZS/FIZU599HNE3XZZS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS0/2G1C/HNE3XZZU/FS02G1CHNE3XZZU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F75/9AIL/HNE44ITW/F759AILHNE44ITW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Assemble (head)"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "now you have a bunch of wires dangling around inside your head.... hope you marked the wires so you know what goes where..... connect your two ears together, at this point your ears should be ready to connect to the relays, and everything else should be connected and in place on top of the hardhat.

Each LED runs on three volts, so since we are using a twelve volt power source we need to put four LEDs in series. This way each LED is running at three volts. If we ran the LEDs in parallel then each one would be running at twelve volts and would burn out because of to much voltage.

These will ask for your input voltage, the desired forward voltage across the LED, and the current that the LED will draw. It will then tell you what resistance you require, as well as what power rating you will need: low power LEDs typically are fine with 1/8 watt resistors, 1W + LEDs typically need 1/2 to 1 watt resistors since they run at 320mA or so. 1) Series Circuits - These circuits are suitable for hooking up multiple LEDs to a higher voltage power source, where the LEDs are DEPENDENT with respect to each other (See Image 1). This means that if one LED dies, the others will follow shortly (but if you wire it correctly, that shouldn't happen for 50k-100k hours!) The best situation for this configuration follows: If you have a 12V power supply, and you want to use (3) 5mm white/blue LEDs, wiring them in series gives you a total voltage drop of (3 x 3.2V = 9.6V) then a single resistor will be required to take up the remaining 2.4V, the resistor calculators will help with this as well.2) Parallel Circuits - These circuits allow multiple LEDs to be hooked up to the same power source, but are INDEPENDENT with respect to each other (See Image 2). In other words, if one LED were to die in a Parallel-only circuit....all the rest will continue to function. This is also the best way to wire different LED colors, since they have different forward voltage requirements, and will require different resistors to achieve long life and optimal brightness. In this case, R1 will not be the same for both LEDs, for instance red LEDs use about 2.4V where blue is 3.2V, so the resistors will not match. Technically, the pictured circuits are BOTH series and parallel, since the LEDs are in series with the resistors, but they ARE parallel to each other.3) Mixed Circuits - The most common application (See Image 3). Most projects will call for more than 3 LEDs, and the most common project power source is 12V, so most of my projects are both series AND parallel circuits. For instance, my DIY aquarium hood has 24W of 1W white LEDs run off a 12V source. That means I had to wire each set of 3 in series with a resistor, then multiply that by 8 (1W x 3)x 8 pair = 24 Total Watts.I hope this guide will help you understand LED circuits, and give you the information needed to obtain hundreds of LEDs for all your projects!

It is a basically a Savonius style turbine but with the refinement that the three wings are shaped to provide lift as well because or their teardrop configuration.  In the above link Lenz describes how he placed an ananometer inside the stational turbine and showed that the windspeed picked up passing past the solid portion of the wings.  This turbine is  more efficient than a pure Savonius in that it provided both drag and lift.In my design I scaled down the diameter to approximately 18 inches and the height to 21 inches. (In hindsight, I should have made the height 18 inches so that there would be more of the center axis free on both ends for flexibility in mounting.) I was able to use materials I had on hand to build the turbine.  When I tested it in a 15 mph wind, it worked so well that I was afraid to stop it for fear of getting injured.  The only downside of what I produced is that it seemed to produce very little electricity.  This is not due to the design of the turbine but to the nature of the DC motor that I had it attached to.  The emphasis in this tutorial will be on how to construct the turbine itself.  Full credit for the design and some of the instructions goes to Ed Lenz.[Note: Since this instructable was published, I learned more about how the wings should be shaped.

It should intersect the two side edges and the top edge.6. From where the center line intersects the bottom edge draw lines to the points where the half circle intersects the side edges.  7.

After consulting with Ed Lenz, I became aware of the mistake that I have made in interpreting his plans.  The new design is illustrated in this step.  Notice that the angle labeled \"Angle A\" is 90 degrees.  Side A is at a right angle to the diameter line of the rounded end of the wing.  In the original design that I presented in this instructable, the two lines forming the pointed end of the were of equal length and their angles to diameter line were identical.  That cone was symetrical whereas in the change being shown here, the cone is not symetrical.  Making Angle A to be 90 degrees will give the wing more liftI have resized the design so that I can drive a minigen generator that had been sold at windstuffnow.com (but is no longer available).  The basic steps in fabricating the lenz2 are still valid.Basic Calculation:I now understand better how to determine the size and proportions of the wing.  You first determine what the diameter of lenz2 will be.  The easiest way to do this is to decide what the distance will be from the center axis of the lenz2 to the outside edge of a wing.  This will be the radius of the lenz2.  You double it to get the diameter.In my new design, I made the assumption that the diameter of lenz2 will be 16 inches (that is, the distance from the center axis to the outside edge of a wing will be 8 inches).To determine the diameter of the wing, multiply the diameter of the lenz2 times .1875.  In my example, 16 inches * .1875 = 3.0 inches.  To determine the length of the wing, multiply the diameter of the lenz2 times .4.  In this case, 16 inches * .4 = 6.4 inches.   The length of Side A is 6.4 minus 1.5 or 4.9 inches.I will be creating a new instructable that will include this design in a lenz2 that drives a minigen generator  ", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZX/6MGC/FGXQOM8L/FZX6MGCFGXQOM8L.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Revision: a Change Inthe Shape of the Wing"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "You will need to have three ribs to connect the two end pieces of each wing.
