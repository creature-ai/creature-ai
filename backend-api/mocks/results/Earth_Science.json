The more you carve, the less you will have to sand.  Next use the Guinevere Sanding System with an 80 grit sleeve to continue to smooth out the carving marks. This is an incredibly helpful tool for sanding spoons and bowls, but be careful not to get too fixated on it. Often you will waste time trying to sand out a mark or scratch that you could gouge out in a few seconds. The best approach is to alternate between the Guinevere Sanding System, gouges and chisels, a sculpting rasp, and 80 grit sandpaper. As you go you will see that each of these tools works better at smoothing out different things, and it is best to stay flexible and switch between them when needed.

Other than that you just need something to contain it in and another can to leave space for the heating chamber.\rI started out small with a coffee can and then went to a larger one made in a big popcorn tin.\rNext you need fire clay. I don't live anywhere near a foundry or within an easy distance to get fire clay so I made my own. for this you need four things; portland cement, perlite, silica sand, and bentonite. \rJust about any lumberyard or hardware store carys portland cement. Don't confuse this with ready-mix or even masonry, get the stuff that says PORTLAND CEMENT really big on the outside of the package. \rPerlite is the white stuff in potting soil. It comes in a bag by itself, it can usually be found at walmart but can also be found at nurserys, lawn&garden places and hardware stores. \rPure silica sand is best but any fine sand will do. probablly the easiest to get is the bags of \"play sand\" you can find at walmart or building centers like home depot or lowes. A lot of tractor supply stores in the midwest carry it during the summer. If you can't find it or just don't want to pay for sand you could just get some from a dry riverbed and sift it (don't take sand from beaches). \rBentonite is what most cheap cat litter is made of. Just look at the label, it should say ingredients: bentonite, make sure it's not mixed with other things like fragrance. If you get cat litter you'll probablly have to find a way to grind and sift it. This takes a lot of time and effort. If you don't want to go through all the trouble just find somewhere online to buy it.\rTo make the masonry I go with a 1:1:1:1 ratio. \rmix one part sand, bentonite, and perlite together, add a little water and mix throughly. \rlet it sit for 30 minutes.\radd a little more water and mix again, let sit for 45 minutes.\radd one part portland cement and enough water so everything is moist and sticks together, but not too much so it's runny. You want it just wet enough to cake easily in your hand and not crumble when you squeeze it.\rFirst fill the bottom to the thinkness you want and pack it down. Then put the center can in and ram fire clay down around it. Once the clay dries a hole is drilled through the wall just above the bottom of the heating chamber and to one side so the heat from the burner tends to spin in the chamber. Then a lid will need to be made. Just use another tin about the same size in diameter, though it only needs to be about 3 inches thick and leave a 2 or 3 inch hole in the center.

When I get a process down that works I'll post it.\rhere are the fundamentals..\rHow to set up the flask:\rThe sand should be moist enough to squeeze in your hand and retain it's shape, bounce it in your hand and it shouldn't crumble.\rplace the bottom (or drag) upside-down on one of the boards, put the item to be cast in the middle of the drag and fill it up with sand. Sift sand that will go immediatly around the pattern and don't worry so much about the rest. Use a rammer, or I've found that a small rubber mallet will work in a pinch, and pack sand tightly around the pattern. It takes a while to get a feel for how much pressure to use, but eventually you'll get the hang of it. Once the drag's compacted scrape off any sand that sicks up over the top edge. Place the other board on top of the drag and with both hands holding it securly flip it over. remove the top board and dust on parting powder. I've read that coal dust works great but it's a lot easier for me to get talcum powder (baby powder, talcum or corn starch can be used) Then put the cope (or top) in place. Pack sand onto the pattern just as you did for the drag. Then cut vent holes above the pattern by pushing a wire, anything from a coat hanger to a knitting needle will do, down through the sand until it touches the pattern. Next cut the sprue, or pouring hole, with a peice of thin brass or steel tubing about 3/4 of an inch in diameter. Now lift the cope off of the drag and set it on it's side, you'll know right here if you've done a good enough job ramming the sand. Once the two are seperated cut the gate, or runner, from the sprue to the patter. A simple tool to use is a spoon, making the channel about 3/4 of an inch wide and about 1/4 of an inch deep. Carefully lift the pattern out of the drag and then place the cope back into position. Pour the metal in a small stream and to one side of the sprue to let air escape and so it doesn't hit the bottom hard enough to loosen the sand. Give your casting time to cool off, then seperate the flask and take out your new part. Cut off the excess from the vent holes and sprue and stick them in a bucket for future use. Sand down your casting and you're good to go.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWS/YQ5W/FIWH5SAK/FWSYQ5WFIWH5SAK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHO/QPJS/FIWH5S9H/FHOQPJSFIWH5S9H.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Casting"}], "channel": "Metalworking"}, {"category": "workshop", "description": " This extra-length segment shows all the various layers that are buried in the foundation hole. There is tubing for the thermal mass and draining piping going into the sump tank. The next video will show the dome structure going up! Please subscribe to this channel to see future videos about building a dome. For more info, see my blog at http://web4deb.blogspot.com or http://www.BigelowBrook.com. http://www.Facebook.com/BigelowBrook I had too much video to cram into 5 or 6 minutes so you get a double-feature today! We\u2019ll start with the sump tank that\u2019s located in the center of the dome area. Plastic tanks can\u2019t be buried directly in dirt since they expand and contract with temperature change and the weight of the dirt will eventually crush them. I surrounded the entire tank with scrap 2 by 4\u2019s and built a brick wall around it. When the well was completed, the goal was to simply lift the tank out, remove the boards and set the tank back in the well, resulting in a space between the tank and the well wall. I didn\u2019t realize that the tank was slightly tapered so the bottom was larger than the top - the tank was trapped inside the well! If you watch carefully, you can see the entire well lift slightly with the tank. Some extra pondering was required\u2026 I decided to slide each board out one at a time until enough were removed to loosen the tank. I drilled part-way through the board, inserted a bolt, wrapped a strap around it, and lifted the board until it hit against the rim of the tank. Then cut the section of board off and repeated the process until the board came out. This was a few hours wasted, but it worked! There is a larger sump tank that is located in the shed area that also needed a well built around it. This is a cone bottom tank so I tightly strapped some 2 by 4\u2019s as legs to it to keep it level, then set the rest of the spacer boards around it. After leveling out the area, I set some cement blocks on the ground to act as a footing for the brick work. When it was complete, a perfectly round well was surrounding the tank and we were able to pull the tank out with the excavator. This is the baby brother excavator compared to the one that dug the foundation hole. With a slightly smaller bucket, it was able to place the dirt back into the bottom half of the hole. Bruce, the operator, was very careful and didn\u2019t hit a single block off the wall! When the area was roughly level, he tamped the dirt into place to help prevent future settling. While Bruce graded around the exterior of the foundation, I set the tubing for the thermal mass. There are 5 equal length perforated pipes that connect to a central manifold which will eventually be connected to a heating system. The tubing zigzags around the floor to help spread the heat evenly throughout the dome. The exhaust for each tube then vents to a different area in the dome. Six inches of stone was placed around the tubing. This is partly to protect the tubing from larger rocks, and partly to allow some more air flow for heat distribution into the thermal mass floor. Earlier in the project, I didn\u2019t have time to set the anchor bolts in the foundation wall. To make sure they were placed in the correct locations, I first cut all the treated lumber sill plates to their correct lengths and labeled them. I then drilled a hole for the anchor bolt into each plate, roughly in the center of a one of the block cavities. The entire cavity didn\u2019t need to be filled with concrete so I filled them half way with stone first. It was a nice day so I got a helper. Her job was to vibrate the air pockets out of the concrete as I shoveled it into the cavity. I then leveled off the area and set the j-bolt into the concrete, and then set the sill plate over the area to make sure the bolt was in the correct location. This is what happens when you don\u2019t wear boots in a construction area! There will be an outer ring of grow beds around the perimeter of the dome, and also a central ring. This 2 inch drain pipe will allow the beds to drain into the central sump tank. The piping is temporarily set on bricks to make sure they are sloped in the right direction. More dirt is filled between the pipe areas and sand is filled around the pipes. This helps to protect them from stone and allows them to be fine-tuned for the proper slope. Now that all the drain pipes are installed, the sump tank can be dropped into the well. Holes are cut through the side of the tank and the pipes are pushed through the holes. I plan on installing an elbow at the end of each drain to try and swirl the water a bit. The large sump tank is a bit trickier to install since the cone shape needs to be properly supported. I made a quick template that was equal to the angle of the cone. Sand was then added to the bottom of the well and I used the template as a guide to shape the sand into the same angle as the cone. The tank dropped into place perfectly! The dome will sit on a 16 inch knee wall. Although each section should match perfectly with the dome, they will be left loose until the dome is assembled so they can be adjusted. Each section is placed on a strip of foam to help prevent air from leaking between the concrete wall and the boards. They are then loosely bolted into place. That\u2019s it for now.

Also be sure to pull dry unsaturated sand from the corners of you container and be sure to roll the top to the bottom and vise versa. Once the binder is fully mixed, you should be able to pack a ball in your hand that cracks not crumbles when squeezed. Now it is time to add the catalysts. This is the tricky part you only have about 10 minutes or so before the two parts dry and harden. At this point you will not be able to use or pack the mixture of epoxy and sand. So just like above you will need to gradually add the catalysts while continuing to mix the sand with your other hand. Remember to be careful of beading. This needs to be done fast. You should be finished mixing the entire 80 lbs of sand in about 3 minutes to be able to have time to pack the mold.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FOU/TCOC/H0GGYK2V/FOUTCOCH0GGYK2V.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRL/W98Q/H0FLNNSH/FRLW98QH0FLNNSH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXI/KFCX/H0FLNNSD/FXIKFCXH0FLNNSD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F88/MIT4/H0FLNNSG/F88MIT4H0FLNNSG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Step 7: Mixing Sand and Epoxy"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Step eight: Quickly lay a 1 to 2 inch base on the bottom of your flask.

It hung over the ends of my old unit (as seen in the coffee table Instructable).\nSo it was time to make a new entertainment unit. This would be my first serious attempt at wood work. The most I\u00a0had done before this was to repair or update existing furniture.Goals:\nIt had to fit my new centre speaker, contain storage and ventilation for my amp and I\u00a0wanted the cords to be (relatively) easy to get to.\nWith nephews and nieces running around, I also wanted to protect the gear from prying, poky fingers.\nAfter a few hours of thinking and several sketches, I came up with something along the lines of the pictures below - which of course morphed as I worked on it.Disclaimer:\nBecause your design should match your individual needs. I\u00a0haven't included exact measurements for every little component of the unit I\u00a0made.\nThe point is really to illustrate that you can and should make a custom unit to suit your gear and maybe save you some money that you might have otherwise spent on one of those laminated modular units.\nYou should end up with a piece of kit that will last you for many years to come - and what's more, if you ever dent/scratch/damage it, you will be able to repair it!\nI\u00a0hope it will serve as inspiration for your work and I look forward to seeing your results!\nPS> I am Australian.

From thieves or accidental damage?\nWrite a list of items you need to put on shelves and sketch out some designs if it will help you visualize where you want to store each piece of equipment.General thoughts about dimensions and things to consider..\nDepth\nOkay, so look at your AV gear and work out how deep the entertainment unit needs to be to accommodate it. \nMeasure your equipment - include the knobs at the front (so the door won't close on them!) and don't forget the cables at the back. Some of them can be stiff, inflexible and stand out a fair way.. \nSo you'll need to include enough room that they will all fit without rubbing/bending/breaking plugs.\nDon't forget to Include the depth of the wood used for the front doors plus their knobs, plus closing clearance so it doesn't hit your gear. Room for cabling at the back and some way of keeping it off the ground.\nRemember the overhang from the top ledge, the thickness of your back panel (if you plan to have one) and you may want to factor in skirting boards if you want the unit to sit flush with the wall.Width\nYou probably won't want your unit narrower than your TV , as it will  look too small and poorly designed (conversely it will make your TV look bigger !).\nIf you don't need to accommodate a centre speaker, you can make the unit the same width as your TV or a bit wider. \nRemember the width of your gear. Give it a little room to breathe and allow for air flow. If you want your gear to slide in/out from the front, remember to make the doors wide enough for it.Height \nGenerally, lower units are more contemporary, but it depends on what look you are going for and what you need to fit in.\nHow high is your couch and coffee table? If you watch a lot of TV laying down, you may want to make the unit slightly higher so that drinks on the table won't block your view.\nHow many shelves do you want/need to hold all your gear? Are you going to buy a new Xbox/PS3 next month?\nAgain, leave some room for airflow.\nLastly.. consider what I call trimming (not sure what it is actually called). But I\u00a0refer to routed/curved/fancy edging that you might dress the edges with to change this thing from a simple box to a piece of furniture.\nThe structure of your joins and the height of your trimming may be a factor in the height.My overall measurements\n187cm long\u00a0(top surface that has some overhang)\n62cm deep (top surface that has overhang at the front)\n60cm high", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F7M/1K70/G962KF5T/F7M1K70G962KF5T.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Planning"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Okay, so here is the basic logic of my design..\nKnowing that wood of 5cm x 1.6cm x length\u00a0 and 7cm x 1.6cm x length are  common in hardware stores, I based a lot of the structure around this.\nI planned to make a wooden frame for the base to provide a little height and some structure (so the bottom shelf wasn't sitting directly on the ground, nor would it sag).\nSo.. 4 pieces of 5cmx1.6cm wood, running front to back, with two long pieces of 5cmx1.6cm wood joining them.

You might also consider ventilation in your top surface. \u00a0I\u00a0opted against that, figuring I'd be pretty upset if someone spilled a drink and it trickled down into my gear.\nHowever.. that would be the most efficient venting system.\nIf you don't want ventilation in your side panels you can skip this step.\nIf you do, here are a few options I\u00a0considered and what I ended up doing.Designing or adapting to your limitations....\nI started with several ideas..\nFancy grills.. \nI've seen these in the higher end ducted heating vents or intakes.You know, brass or stainless steel grills with fancy scroll work? (see picture). \nUnfortunately I\u00a0didn't find any on the day I was looking and didn't think they'd be big enough - I\u00a0also wanted to be able to repeat the design in the front doors. So ducted air vents wouldn't work.\nPurpose built grills..\nWe had some cupboards purpose built for AV gear at work. Brushed aluminum with slots cut into it.\nDidn't find any of these.. and the gear at work runs too hot anyway.\nAudio mesh..\nI\u00a0had considered hiding the equipment from prying eyes using the same mesh as found on speakers. So some kind of grill with that as a backing. You can buy it by the metre.\nEnded up leaving this as a secondary option if the nephews/nieces caused trouble with poky little fingers.\nDowel bars..\nDowel was cheap and readily available... and when I thought about it in my head, \"easy\" to assemble.\nMy initial plan for dowel was to cut slots into one strip of wood and mount that against the flat edge of the entertainment unit, creating a little nook I\u00a0could slip the dowel into.\nYeah... no. The thickness of the strips of wood I wanted to use didn't allow for nice cuts - the speed and power of the saw was too much and would snap the strips before I had made cuts along the full length (was also quite dangerous to cut on the table saw).\nIn the end, I\u00a0went with pieces of dowel inserted into holes in two strips of wood to create a jail bar effect.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F64/PR85/G962KDEX/F64PR85G962KDEX.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Ventilation Design"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "You may decide to skip this altogether - however, I have a Home Theatre PC and a pretty beefy AVR in my unit to so I wanted to make sure there was plenty of airflow.\n(It still gets fairly warm in there with the ventilation you see)\nSummary:\nTo achieve this, I clamped two strips of wood together (the same  thickness as the side panels) and then drilled dowel-sized holes right  through both pieces, evenly along the entire length.\nOnce all holes were drilled along the length, I\u00a0stuck dowel in each hole and pulled the two strips apart - making a little ladder.\nMethod:\n1. Work out the width and height of your vent.\nThe width becomes the length of the strips of wood you will mount the dowel in.\nThe height becomes the length of the individual down pieces.\n2. Cut strips of wood from the same material as your panels (ie: pine in my case), \nMake sure they are the same thickness as your panels and the same length as the width of your vent.\nThey only need to be about 1cm high, to allow a decent amount of the dowel to sit in it.\nYou will need two strips for every vent.\nNote:\nThis is the first piece of wood you are going to mark that is going to  be seen in the end result, so remember to be careful about where you mark it. Pick the  ugliest side to mark and make sure that is going to be glued to something - making sure the nicest side will be seen in the final product ;)\n3. Grab the two strips of of wood that will make one of your end vents and tape them together with some masking tape.\nFace the top bits of the strips upwards (bits that won't get seen and that you plan to drill through).\n4. Grab the two strips of wood that will make up the vent at other end and tape them together with masking tape. Facing the top of the strips upwards again.\n5. Mark a light line down the centre of top of each strip so you know where the centre is for drilling.\n6. Place the two sets of strips beside each other so that you can rule the same measurements across both strips.\n7. Do the math and work out how far apart your holes need to be apart...\nRoughly 4cm from the centre of each dowel to the next is good (this is what I\u00a0used).\nSo work out how many dowel pieces you can fit across your vent at roughly 4cm apart.\nYou may have a slight remainder. You can adjust your spacing until they perfectly fit into your space or you can take that remainder and halve it, putting it at either end\nRemember to factor in the dowel thickness when you are halving your remainder.\nCheck, double check and recheck your results. You will be sad when you put it all together and realize there is a bigger gap at one end.\n8. Mark your holes on the centre line of one strip.\n9. Take your set square and transpose those marks to the second strip.\nDo some measuring to make sure it is all even. Step back, take another look, get a friend to take a look and make sure they are even (okay, don' t go that far, but this is a fair bit of effort if you stuff it up.\n10. Clamp these strips of wood to a scrap piece - that way, when you drill  through the wood it won't tear the edges as you breach the other side.\n11. Insert your drill bit (after sanding hundreds of bits of dowel \"just a bit\" I\u00a0recommend using a drill bit that is 1mm fatter than your dowel)\n12. Holding your drill as perfectly vertical as possible (or using a drill press), drill your holes.\nTake a breather!\n13. Cut your lengths of dowel down to the height of your ventilation hole.\nI recommend going 1 or 2mm shorter than your vent height - it will save you some trouble!\n14. Insert your bits of dowel into one strip of wood with the holes drilled.\nRemove the tape and slide the strips apart (probably best if you leave one strip on the bench and lift the other vertically).\n15. Make any adjustments required to the holes or dowel pieces.\n16. Cut the holes for the vents in the side panels (cut your side panels to size first if you haven't already) - I drilled a hole and used the jigsaw to cut out the vent hole.\n17. Fit your \"ladder\" into the vent hole and see how it fits.\n18. Make any adjustments required - ie: sand the edges of the hole in the panel to ensure it is straight. Nip ends off dowel pieces etc.\n19. Remove dowel pieces from the strips of wood, one by one, adding a dob of wood glue at each end and fitting it back in.\nDo what works for you, but pushing the two strips together so that the dowel sticks out the top and bottom is probably easiest, then slide the strips back to the edge of the dowel so the glue makes contact.\nI\u00a0was going to glue and nail the \"ladder\" into  the vent hole, but nails turned out to be unnecessary.\n20. Place a line of glue along the top and the bottom of your horizontally aligned \"ladders\" (see image 2) and fit them into the vent holes in your end panels.\n21. Clamp them into place and allow to dry (see glue manufacturers instructions)\n22.

This is not an easy task, and I recommend that anyone thinking about doing it AT LEAST consider having the well pump identified as the  failed component by a professional prior to undertaking it.  In my case,  the water in my house stopped working (on a Friday night, of course).  I  know my system pretty well and was able to determine that the fault in  my system COULD NOT BE ANYTHING BUT my well pump motor  before I took any action. Guess what?  I called the plumber anyway. If nothing else, you'll pay $60 to have your diagnosis confirmed and maybe even get an estimate that will provide you with  the motivation to do the job on your own.  (My estimate to pull and  replace the well was $2400... By following these steps I was able to do  the job myself for less than $400!)", "title": "How to Replace a Submersible Well Pump", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Replace-a-Submerged-Well-Pump/", "section": "workshop", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "So this is what we start with. The drawing is not to scale, but essentially most wells look a bit like this. There are several different variations on what ends up being pretty much the same thing.  In my case, the casing (which is the steel pipe that  everything fits into and goes into the ground) has a 6\" diameter. Some casings can be as narrow as 4\". If you're doing something like this on your own, wider is better! A 6\" well casing gives you plenty of room to work on your own.  Narrower casings can make things... complicated.The well used in this example is relatively shallow.  It only runs about 100'-120' deep. Some wells can run to depths of hundreds (or thousands!) of feet. In the case of anything deeper than about 250' I would recommend that you have it pulled by a pro.  Why? Because it's HEAVY!  And there are special tools that contractors have to lift the pump from that kind of depth.  Look at it this way: Even if you have someone else pull the well, you can do the repair/replace action on your own once it's out of the ground, and still save money. ;) My well was dug about 25 years ago.  One of the things that happens with older wells is that, over a period of several years, silt from the aquifer can seep into the bottom of the casing.  That's a bad thing.  Why? Because the silt builds up to a depth that's too close to the pump, and the pump ends up sucking up the silt and muck from the bottom of the well, and then pushes it into your house!  (You'll see the result of this kind of thing in the following pictures.)You basically have three \"lines\" running down into the well.  There's... (1) The water tube (2) The electrical wiring that supplies voltage to the well pump motor, and (3) The safety rope, which is tied directly to the well pump and keeps it from falling down into \"the abyss\" if anything goes wrong.  The weight of the whole pump assembly hangs on the  water hose that the pump uses to push water into  the house.  Up near the top the water tube hits what's called a \"pitless  connector,\" where it makes a hard right turn toward the house.  See how the pump  looks a bit like a bottle made of two pieces?  The bottom part is the motor.   The top part is the impeller that sucks the  water out of the well and  sends it to the house.Here's how it works:When one turns on the sink to wash one's hands or when we flush a toilet, we tend to think that we're pulling water directly from the well to do it.  In actuality, we're not!  In a properly outfitted house, you're pulling water from a pressurized tank that acts as sort of a \"middle man.\"  (Some artesian wells don't have this set up, but let's pretend they do!)   When you turn on the water to wash your hands or flush your toilet, the amount of water stored in the pressure tank is reduced.  Reduced water in the tank means reduced pressure.  The pressure switch on the tank is set up so that it knows what point to turn ON the pump (pulling water up from the well to replace what you've used), and what point to turn OFF the pump (to keep your system from exploding). Having a pressure tank does two things for you:1) It provides a nice, steady amount of water pressure throughout your house... all the time.2) It saves electricity and wear-and-tear on the pump, which is buried deep in the ground.Ideally, your well pump should be able to push more water than above-average household use will require. (Most houses are recommended to have a pump that will support 5 gallons per minute.) That way, more water per minute is pushed up from the well than you can (normally) expect to be able to get out of a sink, or a shower.  By having a pump that exceeds your practical use, the pressure tank is able to maintain steady flow.  There will always be more water available to the tank than you can pull from the tap.  With the right pump, you can have two showers, a sink and a toilet all flowing at the same time without any discernible drop in pressure.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FA3/EUS0/IAIFIKZV/FA3EUS0IAIFIKZV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Start With Understanding What Your Well Looks Like, and How It Works."}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Now that we know what all is down there and how all of it works together, it's time to take action!In order to pull all of this stuff out of the well, you need a special  tool called a \"pitless adapter wrench.\"  It's basically made of three  pieces of threaded, metal pipe that you can get from any hardware store.  A \"T\" connector holds them together.  The handles can be any length you like, but I wouldn't go any longer than 12\". Standard pitless connectors use a 1\" threaded pipe.  Mine... of  course... was non-standard.  It uses 3/4\" threaded pipe.  To make one of  these wrenches you just go down to the local hardware store, buy the threaded pipes and put them together.  The long pipe (the one that goes down into the hole) needs to be at least 5' long if you want it to reach.   Once you've made your wrench, you just stick it down into the well, thread it into the connector and get ready to PULL.  While you  do that, make sure someone is holding onto the safety rope!  If  anything goes wrong, and your partner happens to NOT be holding the rope, the well  pump will fall into the abyss... lost forever. *que ominous music*", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FDG/F73W/IAIFIKZW/FDGF73WIAIFIKZW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Pulling the Well Pump Up Out of the Well"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "*SAFETY NOTE!!* BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING WITH THE WELL CAP MAKE SURE YOU KILL THE POWER AT THE WELL PUMP CIRCUIT BREAKER!!!

You want to leave them threaded a bit, so you don't lose them. Then give the well cap a few \"uppercut\" swings with a medium-sized hammer.  It should pop off without much trouble.Once the cap is off, take a look down the well with a flashlight.  You should see something that looks a little like this image (which I \"borrowed\" from a google search, because I forgot to take my own picture).

It is... but that's just the way it has to be.  Pitless connectors have to be located BELOW the frost line for your area.  If they aren't, all it will take is one really cold night to freeze up.

I used my  salvaged hose clamps to secure the new water line to the reducer.Some people may read this and wonder, \"What is a check valve?\"  It's basically a valve that only allows fluids to move in one direction.  Water can flow into your house when the pump pushes it, but it can't drain back into the well when the pump stops.  This is a vital component, because when your system gets pressurized the check valve keeps all the water in your house from dumping back down into the well.  Kind of a big deal.

First,  you have to calculate the volume of water that's in the well.  In my  case, I'm going to guess that it's about 70' of total water space in a  6\" tube.  Using the formula \u03c0r\u00b2h (3.14159x9x840) you get a total volume  of about 23,750 cubic inches.  That's about 102 gallons of water  occupying the well at its fullest point.Proper  chlorination requires 3 pints of 5% chlorine bleach per 100 gallons of  water in the well, PLUS 3 pints of the same to sanitize the plumbing inside the  house.  That's a total of 6 pints of 5% chlorine bleach.  A gallon is 8  pints, so a single gallon will be enough to do the job AND sanitize the  well cap before I put it back on.Here's  what you do: Dump about 3/4 of the gallon of bleach in the well (with  the water pump still on, so you can still use your hose).  Then run your  hose down the well to circulate the bleach.  This process WILL pull  bleach water into your house, so don't plan on using the water during  this process.  Run the hose for about an hour to get the water from the  bottom all the way back up to the top, ensuring that the chlorine mixes  with ALL the water in the well.  Then use the remaining 1/4 of the  bottle to sanitize the well cap.  Put the cap back on and go inside.TURN  ON EVERY TAP IN THE HOUSE, SEQUENTIALLY. Run COLD water until you smell  bleach at every tap.  Give the toilets a few flushes to pull water into  them, also.  Once you smell the bleach, turn it off.  The chlorine will  sit in your pipes and kill off anything living in them.Repeat the process using the HOT water.  It's going to take a little longer for the bleach smell to show up, because the water from the well is going to have to make it through your water heater, and then up through the hot water pipes.Go to sleep. It has to sit for at least 12 hours, undisturbed.  No sinks.  No flushies. No washies. The  next day, hook up your hoses and start purging.  DON'T SUCK THE WELL  DRY WHILE YOU DO IT.  Also, DON'T DRAIN THE BLEACH WATER INTO THE LEECH FIELD FOR YOUR SEPTIC SYSTEM. Remember, there were about 100 gallons in the  well, so figure out how many gallons per minute you push through the  hoses and stop when you hit about 150 gallons through the system.  In my  case, that was about an hour and a half.Once you hit that point, cut  the hoses off.  Then purge the inside of the house.  IF YOU HAVE A  SEPTIC TANK (I don't) YOU'LL WANT TO CAPTURE ANYTHING OUT OF THE SINKS  WITH A BUCKET, SO THAT YOU DON'T KILL OFF THE BACTERIA IN THE SEPTIC  SYSTEM. Don't forget that the cold water lines and the hot water lines are completely separate.  You'll have to drain them both.Make sure you dump the water someplace safe.  Run each tap for a couple of  minutes. Give the toilets a flush or two.  Then test the water for  chlorine content to make sure it's safe to drink with a kit you can get from the hardware or pool supplies store.  Keep running the  water until the test comes back at safe levels to drink.Thanks for reading!

I wrote this ible in May of 2015.  It is now October of 2017.  Late last night, the well cut out on me.  It was the first time we've had any issue since I did the installation.  I'll spare you all the details of what I went through to figure out the problem.  Bottom line: When I replaced the well pump, I probably should have replaced the electrical wiring going down to the pump.  Two reasons for this:1) The wire I inherited was some kind of specialized, 12 gauge, submersible pump wire.  Old school.  Prone to problems.  It didn't have a ground wire, which I thought was weird at the time but figured the previous pump had been working for years without it... so... made due with what I had.2) That old school wire can go bad on you.  Even with a torque arrestor in place the pumps can spin inside of the casing, which twist the power line.  If given enough time, the wire will eventually break... which is what happened to me.The moral of the story: Replacing your electrical wiring only costs about $150 (if you go with the high-end, 12 gauge, no-casing, submersible wiring you can get at places like Lowe's).  The good thing about the newer stuff is that it doesn't tend to break when it gets twisted up.  If you don't want to have to pull your well pump up out of the casing again, just to change the wiring three years after you did the job, maybe take care of it while you have it out of the ground the first time.High five!", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 29: Update!

I haven't seen many instructables related to glass fiber reinforced concrete (aka GFRC), so I thought this would be useful.  GFRC takes a bit more planning to obtain materials and make your mix, but makes other parts of the process much easier for a DIYer.  The weight reduction by 50% or more makes it easier to move precast pieces around.  It pops out of the form basically pinhole free, so can be polished and finished without messy grinding (this is a HUGE reduction in labor and hassle involved).  And its way stronger, so no rebar or other reinforcement is necessary.  Lastly, while I used a semi-overmold to integrate the plywood support structure and create a floating effect, you don't need one to do vertical surfaces, so the form can be greatly simplified.  (If I were to do this again I would not have integrated the plywood support.)The other pieces of the fireplace makeover were done using techniques that are well documented elsewhere, but I'll provide a quick overview here, before getting into details of casting the GFRC hearth.(1) The durock/drywall work to create the nooks was done by a contractor.  (There are some things, like drywall work, that I don't like to do, and are fairly cheap, so I hire those out.)(2) I used the Henry Feather Finish (available at Home Depot), aka Ardex Feather Finish, to put 3 coats of concrete microtopping on the walls of the fireplace.  Do a search for Ardex concrete fireplace and you'll find a good tutorial.  Only thing I did differently is apply it directly over existing drywall, which worked great.  After 3 coats, I finished it with Dupont Stonetech high gloss finishing sealer.  I just used a microfiber rag to apply the sealer.  I like this finish because it gives a shiny, hard, stone-like appearance to the concrete wall.  If I were to do this again, I might use Ardex SD-M (special order product), which can accept pigment.  This way I could color match the concrete hearth to the concrete wall.(3) I used Schluter 3/16\" black metal Jolly trim and Stikwood Vandyke peel n' stick wood in the nooks.  I attached the trim with 2-sided carpet tape (works fine because Stikwood is laid over part of it and holds it in place), then applied Stikwood per instructions on their website.  I'll do a separate instructable on this later, since I haven't seen anyone else post one with the trim added to a wood wall (which gives it a super-clean modern finish).Now on to the GFRC hearth....", "title": "GFRC Floating Concrete Hearth for Concrete & Wood Fireplace", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/GFRC-Floating-Concrete-Hearth-for-Concrete-Wood-Fi/", "section": "workshop", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "This is probably the most daunting part for a DIYer, but in the end, is not too difficult.

Type I/II portland cement: ($10-20 for each 94 lb bag) I used white portland cement, which you'll need to source locally.  If you have a White Cap / HD Supply near you, they carry it.  Check with a masonry supply store if you don't have a white cap nearby.  Or, you can just use grey portland cement available from Home Depot.  The drawback to grey portland is you have less control over coloration.  If your project needs more than 1 bag of portland and you use grey, you'll want to mix them together beforehand, since color can vary from bag to bag.3. Acrylic Polymer: ($125 for 40 lb bucket) This is part of the magic of GFRC, which replaces water with acrylic polymer.  This makes the concrete harder, less prone to shrinkage/cracking etc.  I used a product called KongKrete, and highly recommend it.  4. Superplasticizer: ($42 for 1 gal) This makes the concrete mix more fluid, without requiring more water than useful.  It is key in the GFRC face coat mix to popping a pinhole-free piece right out of the form.  The amount you use will vary depending on your project.  If you need a playdough like consistency for coating a vertical surface, you use very little.  If you want a super fluid mix that fills a form and self levels, you use more. I used the Optimum superplasticizer from Fishstone.5. Defoamer: ($42) This is a key ingredient that prevents air bubbles from being trapped in the mix.  Combined with the superplasticizer, it can result in pieces that pop right out of the form with few pinholes (and perhaps even perfect).  I went with the C-64 defoamer from Fishstone.6. Pozzolans: ($50 for 50 lb bag) It is my understanding these are not 100% required, but they were recommended to me, and I can tell you the mix I made with them was super easy to work with.  I used a product called Alto-Pozz.8. Water: you know where to get this.Note on Cost: You'll likely need to ship everything but the sand and cement.  You can expect $60-100 in shipping costs.  All told, I spent about $650 on mix materials.  However, this is enough to make about 1000 lbs of mix.  I only used 180 lbs for the hearth, and am going to use the rest for other projects.  Since I have other projects, the mix cost for this project was about $130.  If you have other projects (and you likely will once you see how awesome GFRC is), then it is 100% worth it to invest in this amount of materials.  If you don't, you could use a GFRC pre-mix products.  If you only plan on one project, it would be more economical to get pre-mixed products, with the exact amount you need.  For this project, you could get 3 bags of Fishtone's GFRC mix, 5 lbs of glass fiber, and it will be somewhere around $200-250 including shipping.Other materials / tools1. Hopper gun for face coat: $100 (optional depending on shape of form) 2. Air compressor: any pancake compressor you have will do, assume most people have one3. 4x8 melamine board(s): $28/each - I only need one for the hearth which was a trapezoid with 6 ft back and 4 ft front.4. Saws: you can do this with only a circular saw, but a table saw and miter saw will make life easier.5. hot glue gun: assume you have one, $10 from amazon if not6. black silicon caulk - $6/tube - 1 tube should be enough7. metal ball cake fondants - $7 - this is my secret tool, and allows for perfect edges in the form8. outdoor double sided carpet tape - $5-8 - available at Home Depot9. paste finishing wax - $8, from Home Depot10.  LOTS of buckets.  Get these from Home Depot. $2-3/each. I recommend getting 6x 5 gallon buckets, 6x 10-quart paint bucket (with measuring lines), and 6x 5-quart paint buckets (with measuring lines).11. Syringes for measuring out defoamer and plasticizer.  $312. Abranet sanding pads, or wet/dry sanders 220 - 400 grit.  13. Drill and Spiral or Helical Mixing Paddle.  Since I have a few projects, I splurged on this mixer ($110 from Home Depot).  You can also just use a heavy duty 1/2\" corded drill if you have one, with a spiral mixing paddle ($15 from HD).  Make sure you get a paddle where the bars are blade-like (like the one in the link), rather than tube-like, and are spiral or helical.  The tube-like ones for paint won't move through the concrete as well.  You can't make GFRC by hand.14. Angle grinder15. Random Orbit Sander", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: Gathering the Materials"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "This is a pre-cast design, so the hearth is being cast upside down.  The form had two parts: (a) the melamine base form and (b) the plywood and foam insert.  The plywood and foam insert was designed to be left in the concrete after it cured, to form a base for the hearth to rest.  The plywood insert was made to be 2.25\" taller than the height of the concrete (which is dictated by the height of the melamine sidewalls in the base form).  In short, I do not recommend doing it this way.  I would suggest making the base form as I did and that is it.  Making the plywood insert and pouring concrete around it, turned out to be a huge hassle.  As explained later, you can still create a hollow hearth by packing the backer coat up the sides like play-doh.  Then, build your base however you like to raise the hearth up to your fireplace (you can use plywood or 2x4s painted black for the base).  To make the base form you'll need to do the following:(a) Cut melamine strips for the sides of your form to the height of your hearth.  In my case, the hearth needed to have a height of 3.75\" (with 2.25\" of space between the bottom of the concrete and the floor so that my hearth would be even with the bottom of my fireplace, which is 6\" from the floor).  It is easiest to cut these strips on a table saw, but it can be done with a circular saw if you are very careful to make cuts consistently.  Cut all the strips at once, so the height is identical.  Then use your miter saw to cut the strips to the lengths you need.(b) Cut a base piece of melamine to the size you need for your hearth.  The base of the form should be 5.5\" wider and 5.5\" longer than the longest/widest dimensions of your hearth.  For example, my hearth was 72\" long and 15\" wide, so my base needed to be at least 77.5\" x 20.5\".  The extra room is so you have room 3/4\" melamine sides and 2x3 or 2x4 supports (which are 1 5/8\" thick) on either side of the form.(c) If you have any non-90 degree angles on your sides, miter the edges of your side strips to the exact angle.  It is important that the inside of the form is formed entirely by the white melamine (no endgrain).  In my case, I had a 6' back and 4' front on my hearth, with 15\" depth.  I cut the 6' and 4' melamine sides to the exact length needed, then laid out longer pieces for the sides.  I made sure the 6' and 4' sides were centered and 15\" apart, then laid out longer strips next to them to figure out the angle with my angle finder.  For these dimensions, the angle turned out to be 53\".  I then used my miter saw to cut all the sides of the form to create the 53 degree angle.(d) Double check that your melamine side strips are perfectly flat (re-cut if not).  (e) Before permanently attaching the side strips, lay out the sides on the base exactly as you want them.  If you have right angles, use a square to make sure they are all perfect.  Check any other measurements you want to make sure are accurate.  In my case, I measured to make sure the centers of the 4' front and 6' back strips were perfectly aligned, and that the angle on both corners was 53 degrees.  Now, use a pencil and mark the outside edge of the strips on the form.  (f)  Remove the side strips and attach short 2x2, 2x3, or 2x4 pieces to the outside of the side strips.  To attach them, I used 2\" construction screws.  You can use whatever you have handy, just make sure to pre-drill your holes so you don't split the support or the melamine sides.  One or two screws for each support is enough. Your support pieces should be shorter than the height of your side strips.  I had 3.75\" H side strips, so 2x3s and 2x4s worked.  The bottom of the 2x2/3/4 supports should be as close to flush to the bottom of the melamine strips as possible, BUT, whatever you do, make sure the bottom of the support doesn't extend past the bottom of the melamine strip.  This will cause your strip to angle inward, and result in an edge of your hearth not being square.  (NOTE: if your height is 1.5\" or less, you can skip this step, because the carpet tape, silicon, and hot glue will be enough to hold your side forms in place)(g) Apply the double sided carpet tape to the underside of the side strips.  If the tape is wider than the melamine (mine was 2\"), use a razor to cut the tape down so it is flush with the melamine.  Then stick your side forms to the base form using the lines you drew in step (e) as guides.  (f) With your hot glue gun, go around the outside edges (NOT the inside) and glue your side strips to the base form.  Since you are gluing your 2x3 or 2x4 supports as well, you don't need to screw them to the base form.(g) Apply paste wax to the inside of your form, then caulk the inside corners using black silicone caulk and the cake fondets. TAKE YOUR TIME AND DO THIS RIGHT - WATCH THIS VIDEO.  The video explains it better than I can in words here.  After the caulk cures and you pull the excess to leave clean caulk lines, your form is ready.As mentioned above, I don't recommend building the plywood insert into the mold like I did, so I am not going to go into details of this here.

This step involves first figuring out how much mix you'll need to make (i.e., the overall weight), and then pre-weighing and measuring out all the ingredients into buckets.(a) Calculate the total weight of the face coat mix you need for your project.To figure the total weight of face coat mix you'll need, calculate the square footage of your project, including top and sides.  There are plenty of calculators online to help you do this.  Mix 2 lbs of face coat for every square foot of surface you need to cover.  Since my hearth was about 12 sq ft., I needed 24 lbs.  I actually mixed 30 lbs of face coat, but this turned out to be way more than I needed.  I sprayed my face coat pretty thick (about 1/4\").  You can go thinner, and use less face coat, but for your first project erring on the side of too much face mix and a thicker face coat is better.  (b) Calculate the total weight of the backer mix you need for your project.To figure out how much backer mix you'll need, use the square footage of your project you calculated in (a).  Then figure out how thick you want your hearth to be.  For most GFRC projects 3/4\" concrete is plenty strong.  If you like to (WAY) overbuild, then you can bump it up to 1\", but honestly this isn't really necessary unless you have large cantilevers or overhangs.  If you are doing 3/4\", then take your total square footage and multiply by 8 lbs / sq ft. (which is the approximate weight of 1 sq ft of GFRC at 3/4\" thick) to figure out the total weight of your mix.  If you are doing 1\" thick, then do the same calculation, but you 10.67 lbs / sq ft instead of 8 lbs /sq ft.  (Note: This will actually build in a cushion, since your backer is actually 1/8\" - 1/4\" less thick, depending on the thickness of your face coat.  For sake of simplicity and building in a cushion with my calculations, I'm pretending the backer is 3/4\", when in reality, it will be less since the total thickness of my face coat plus backer will be 3/4\".)My hearth was about 12 sq ft., and I planned to have 3/4\" concrete, so I calculated 12 sq ft * 8 lbs/sqft to be 96 sq ft.  Multiply by 1.1 and I needed ~106 lbs.  I rounded up to 120 lbs, but it turned out not to be necessary as I had excess mix.  (You'll notice a huge savings in material and weight, which makes GFRC less expensive than it might seem initially.  To do this with Quikrete you would need to go 1.5\" - 2\" thick, and since GFRC weighs less per sq ft than mix with gravel aggregate, you more than cut your weight in half.)   (c) Measure out ingredients in buckets.The key to making the process of spraying the face coat and pouring/packing the back coat go smoothly, is measuring out your mix ingredients ahead of time in buckets.    You'll want to measure out multiple batches, so you'll have a row of buckets measured out for each batch.  For the 30 lbs of face coat I needed just 1 batch, since this easily fits in 5 gallon bucket.  For backer mix, if you are using 5 gallon buckets to mix, I don't recommend going higher than 60 lbs per batch.  (I tried measuring ingredients out for an 80 lb patch, and it would have made the 5 gal bucket so full that mixing the ingredients would have been difficult, so I re-measured into 60 lb batches).  For my project, I measured out 3 rows of buckets for one 30 lb face coat  batch, and two 60 lb backer coat batches.

I have tried mixing a couple ways, and order doesn't seem to matter all that much, so long as you add dry material to water in multiple phases (i.e., do NOT add water to your dry material, or mix everything together all at once).  You also need to allow 5 minutes after mixing your face coat for it to set up.  Here is what I found easiest for the face coat mix:1. Mix together your dry ingredients (sand, portland cement, alto-pozz, pigment (if using powdered pigment)).  Use your mixer to make sure the dry ingredients are blended well.  Wear a dusk mask, you don't want to breath in portland.2. mix your wet ingredients in a separate big bucket (polymer, water, defoamer, plasticizer).  Err on the low side with water, you can always add a bit more if needed.3. add 50% of your dry ingredients to the bucket with the wet ingredients, then mix thoroughly4. add another 25% of your dry ingredients, mix thoroughly again.5. scrape the sides of the mix bucket with a trowel, mix thoroughly again.6. add remainder of dry ingredients, mix thoroughly, scrape sides again, mix thoroughly again.7. wait 5 minutes.  This is important since the sand takes a bit to absorb all water it can.  As sand absorbs water, the mix gets thicker.  Thus, if you don't wait, you run the risk of your face mix thickening mid-spray, and clogging your hopper gun.8. after 5 minutes, test the consistency of your face mix with a trowel (see videos below).  Add a touch of water if needed, and mix again.9. load 5-10 lbs of face mix into your hopper gun and spray the form.  There is a technique to this, so watch the videos I pasted below.  The explain better than I can in words.10. As soon as you spray, use a chip brush to remove any air bubbles from seams and face.  Again, watch the videos below, as they explain it well.11. Wait for the face coat to firm up before adding backer coat.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F1O/6HDN/IYV9C7CG/F1O6HDNIYV9C7CG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F46/1HLD/IYV9C7E2/F461HLDIYV9C7E2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM2/IWYF/IZYGJ4WG/FM2IWYFIZYGJ4WG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNH/6HCK/IZYGJ4XV/FNH6HCKIZYGJ4XV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Mixing and Spraying the Face Coat"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "The timing of your backer coat is important, so make sure your face coat has firmed up enough (but not completely dried out), before you start your backer coat.  Usually this only takes 30-60 minutes, but it was really cold in our basement (probably 50 degrees F) and it took forever.  After an hour and a half I got impatient and added backer while the face coat was still malleable.  The result was a few visible spots in the final product where the backer came through.  Watch this video to get a better idea when your face coat is ready:You can wait until its ready to mix, so long as you have everything measured out in buckets (so mixing only takes a few minutes).  The process is similar to mixing the face coat, except you add glass fiber at the end.1. Mix together your dry ingredients (sand, portland cement, alto-pozz, pigment (if using powdered pigment)). Use your mixer to make sure the dry ingredients are blended well. Remember to wear your dust mask.2. Mix your wet ingredients in a separate big bucket (polymer, water, defoamer, plasticizer). Err on the low side with water, you can always add a bit more if needed. 3. add 50% of your dry ingredients to the bucket with the mixed wet ingredients, then mix thoroughly 4. add another 25% of your dry ingredients, mix thoroughly again. 5. scrape the sides of the mix bucket with a trowel, mix thoroughly again. 6. add remainder of dry ingredients, mix thoroughly, scrape sides again, mix thoroughly again.7. Add 25% of your glass fiber, mix thoroughly, and repeat until all your glass fibers are mixed in.  8. (Dryer Back Coat) If you made a dryer backer mix (with less superplasticizer), hand pack your backer mix in, gently pushing it into the face coat.  If you have vertical surfaces (I had 3.5\" vertical faces), pack the seams at the bottom first, then work your way up the vertical packing. You want to pack the backer up and over the edges at the top of the sides of your form to make sure you don't have cracks or even bottom corners .  (This allows you to come back with a grinder and grind the bottom perfectly level using the sides of your form as a guide.) . Also, don't pack too thick at once.  I like to pack 1/4\" - 3/8\" thick layers.  If you are making multiple backer batches (e.g., 2-3 60 lb mixes), then try to cover all your surfaces with each batch (applying a thinner layer over everything first helps with this).   Make sure to carefully but firmly work the backer mix into the corners as you pack.OR(Flowable or Self-Consolidating (SCC) backer mix) If you make your mix more flowable (with more superplasticizer), then you can pour your mix in, work it into the corners and seams and let it cure.  Make sure to pour all the way up to the edges (and perhaps slightly over the edges, to make sure you have nice bottom edges).  This is much easier if you don't have vertical surfaces.  However, an SCC won't work if you have vertical surfaces you need the backer to cling to.  (I used an SCC backer coat on the 1.75\" thick bartop I made to match the hearth.  Pics of this bartop, its form, etc. are mixed in throughout this project, and I'll try to make a separate simple countertop instructable for it at some point.)  Also, with a flowable self-leveling mix, you have to make sure your form is perfectly level.  If it isn't, the bottom of your end product won't be level either.  Have some shims nearby in case you notice it flowing to one side after you pour.OPTIONAL: You can also use a GFRC standard roller to work in the backer back and align the fibers.  While it isn't necessary using a roller to align fibers this will make your piece stronger, and ensures a good bond between the face coat and backer.  The idea is that have 2 or more layers of backer coat, where you roll in different directions in each layer, so fiber layers are aligned perpendicular to one another.  This crosshatch pattern of fibers adds significant flexural strength.  When I realized that I really liked Fishstone's mix products (over other products I've tried, such as Surecrete and various home depot mixes) and was going to be recommending them, I asked if they might send me some rollers to try out so I could add them to this instructable.  (While they did not charge me for the rollers, I paid for everything else, and was planning to recommend their products regardless of whether they sent me the GFRC rollers.)  They were kind enough to send me a variety, including the corner roller, 1x3 roller, and 2x6 roller.  For the average DIYer, I would recommend getting the 2x6 roller, but would not recommend the 1x3 roller.  The design of the 1x3 roller was different from the 2x6 roller.  The 1x3 roller has continuous ridges extending around its entire circumference, whereas the 2x6 roller has individual nodules all over it, which I found did a much better job.  The corner roller was nice, but I did not think it was necessary.  In short, go for the 2x6 roller if you are an average DIYer, you really don't need much less.

The demolding is usually pretty simple.  Unscrew the screws from your form, then use your hands to pull the side walls away.  If the side walls don't come off easily, use a rubber mallet to gently tap the sides of the form away from the concrete.  If you flipped the piece over before demolding, it should be fairly easy to remove the bottom of the form (which is now on top).  If it doesn't come off, then use a plastic putty spackle (not metal or anything sharp that could scratch the concrete!) to gently pry the bottom off.  If it is really tough, then there is likely a vaccum between the form and concrete.  In this case, you can use an air gun attached to your air compressor to shoot air between the form and concrete.

One of the tools in the treasure chest was a belt sander. However, I wasn't really using the belt sander for large surfaces. I was mostly using it to clean up my rough cuts on small parts. To do this I would hold the belt sander with one hand and the part with the other. No too safe and not very controllable. Using scraps of junk lying around my garage, I decided to make a stand. Now I can use both hands to hold the part for better safety and accuracy.I also designed this stand so that you can quickly remove the belt sander from the stand by unscrewing two wingnuts. But to be honest, since making this stand, I've rarely used the belt sander in the hand held mode.I apologize for the lack of photos in this Instructable. I threw this stand together a long time ago. I can't disassemble it for new photos because it is glued together. This belt sander stand is linked to another Instructable I previously posted. https://www.instructables.com/id/Make-a-footswitch-become-a-monkey./The stand was in one of those photos. Some Instructable viewers were interested in how I made this stand. So I decided to create this Instructable, after the fact.Oh yeah, as commented in my other footswitch Instructable, this will only work on belt sanders with a trigger lock. Or if you're desperate you can always zip tie the trigger and make a footswitch.Note, my belt sander is a Sears Craftsman Model 315. It is an older model and is no longer available from Sears. All belt sanders are different. Shape and dimensions differ especially in the handle/grip area. My model 315 has a very angular shaped enclosure with many flat surfaces. Flat surfaces made it easier to mount to a stand. Newer belt sanders are more organic in shape. (Can someone tell me why a power tool needs to look like the head of Alien?) So the method I used in this Instructable may or may not apply to your belt sander.If you don't own a belt sander, you can always go to Sears and purchase a proper bench belt/sander:http://www.sears.com/shc/s/p_10153_12605_00921514000P?keyword=sanderThey're reasonably priced and not much more expensive than a handheld belt sander.This is an easy Instructable that you can do in one day. You can put this together with basic tools: Saber/JigsawScrewdriverRock, Paper, ScissorsDrillSquare/LevelAwlClampsParts:1.5\" x 1.5\" lumber (I think tradesmen call this 2x2 since they're half of a 2x4,)1/2\" thick plywoodSheet rock screwsWood gluePlastic sheetSilicone adhesiveThread/stringDouble sided tapeTranswarp driveVacuum cleaner nozzle attachment2 Bolts, wingnuts and washers", "title": "Belt Sander Stand", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Belt-Sander-Stand/", "section": "workshop", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The belt sander stand is really simple. It basically consists of eight pieces.\rTwo-1/2\" plywood sides\rOne-Vertical column 13\" tall\rTwo-Horizontal legs 10\" long\rTwo-Lateral feet 1/2\" plywood 10\" x 3.5\"\rThe first thing to do is design the sides of the stand. Each side is made from 1/2 inch plywood.\rThe sides of the plywood are held together by screws, bolts and wingnuts. In essence what you're designing is a type of clamp that will sandwich the belt sander around the handle area. Typically, the handle area is designed to be pretty sturdy.\rFirst thing to do is to make cardboard templates for the sides. Rough it out and keep trimming until the template fits perfectly. My belt sander required a different template for the other side since the enclosure differed on each side. Leave some extra room for the 2x2 vertical column. At the top you'll notice I left some room for a bolt that will secure both sides together.\rWhen you're satisfied with the template, transfer it to the plywood and cut it out with a saber saw/jigsaw.\rYou'll also need to located and drill holes for the trigger and trigger lock. I drilled a hole for the trigger on the left side and a hole for the trigger lock on the right side.

Take into account the belt sander cord. If you make the vertical column too short, you won't have enough room to route the cord. Just mock it up by clamping the sides to the 2x2 and mark off the approximate length. Mine just happened to be 13\" long.\rFrom the 2x2 lumber, cut two horizontal legs. The length should be long enough to stabilize the belt sander fore to aft. Mine was 10\" long.\rAt this point, you can mock up everything together with clamps. Make sure everything is square and level. You can see in one of the photos that I made the face of the sander as vertical as possible.\rWhen you're satisfied, you can screw it all together. Since 2x2 is pretty thick, predrill holes before screwing together. I also added wood glue prior to final assembly. In the photos you can see there are two screws in the corner for added strength.\rLastly I created the lateral feet. Design these so that the stand is stable left to right.

I secured the nozzle to the end of one the legs by double sided tape and a single sheet rock screw.\rThe funnel is made up of plastic sheets. The plastic came from a large liquid detergent bottle. \r(Can you tell from the color we use Tide?) I first mocked up the funnel in cardboard then transferred them to the plastic.

You can use the same process to make insulated foundations for any type of structure \u2013 straw bale, earthbag, cordwood, etc.\nYurts or gers are very efficient and practical in harsh, cold climates, as evidenced by centuries of use in Mongolia. Benefits of yurts include affordability, rapid construction, ease of construction, wind resistance, great looks and portability (ability to take your home with you if you ever move). You may even save on taxes since some jurisdictions do not consider yurts permanent homes.\nMany people build their yurts on a raised wooden platform to reduce moisture problems. But wood is expensive and building a platform/deck requires a fair amount of tools and carpentry know-how. Wood is vulnerable to fires and prone to rot and insect damage. It also requires regular painting or sealing. And if the wind and snow can blow underneath like most designs, then you\u2019ll lose a lot of heat.\nIn addition to the many other uses for earthbags (retaining walls, domes, rootcellars, houses, etc.), you can build insulated foundations by filling the bags with insulation such as scoria. The benefits of the insulated earthbag foundation system described here include:\n- Very low cost, especially if you can locate recycled grain bags from farmers\n- Very simple construction using just a few tools most people already have\n- Save energy and enjoy a more comfortable home because the floor and foundation are superinsulated (with no wind blowing under the floor to suck heat away)\n- No deep footings/excavation required (see Frost-protected Shallow Foundations design guide mentioned below)\n- The finished floor can be raised above grade as high as necessary. Deep snow? Flooding? No problem.\n- Building a rocket stove into the foundation for heating.\nFor those who live in Canada or similar climates, you might want to follow the Earth-Sheltered Solar Canadian blog , who\u2019s planning to build an insulated earthbag foundation that\u2019s suitable for extremely cold climates.\nBuilding in extremely cold climates uses the same process as outlined in this Instructable, but you will need a deeper trench with additional insulated earthbags below grade to create a Frost-protected Shallow Foundation (FPSF) . Combine these two ideas \u2013 FPSF and insulated earthbag foundations as shown in this Instructable \u2013 and you\u2019ll have everything you need to know for free.\nThe following instructions assume you have cleared and leveled the site, removed topsoil, and positioned scoria around the building site to minimize work.\n3D AutoCAD drawings show each step of construction.", "title": "Insulated Earthbag Foundations for Yurts", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Insulated-Earthbag-Foundations-for-Yurts/", "section": "workshop", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "\nDig a foundation trench slightly wider than your earthbags.

Consult the FPSF guide mentioned above for more details. For instance, the drawing shows how earthbags can be started at ground level (\u2018on-grade\u2019) in mild climates.

He digs around some alternatives and dredges up the pot-in-pot system developed by one Mr. Mohammad Bah Abba in Nigeria, Africa.  The gist is this: take a big, unglazed terra cotta pot and fill it with a little sand then put a smaller pot inside and fill the gap between with more sand.  Add water and allow evaporation to provide the cooling.  Mr. Sweeney indicates he was impressed with the results.Well, I decided to go a bit further.First, the science behind the whole thing is that of the wet-bulb thermometer.  You know: the one that measures the dewpoint?  The gist is that terrestrial air has some amount of moisture in it and that vaporizing (liquid) water to dissolve it in the (gaseous) air requires energy which comes from the heat that is present in the air.  Because heat allows the transfer, a thermometer with a \"wet bulb\" will read a cooler temperature than a one with a \"dry bulb\".  That is, something that is wet is always a little cooler than something that is dry.  All because of evaporation.Second, how can one convert this to something practical?  Like, say, the ever present problem of keeping one's beer ... er ... beverage cool on a hot day.So I developed the idea of a terra cotta beverage cooler.  It works like this: you add water to elicit evaporation which causes cooling which keeps your beverage cool.  Even on a hot day.  And it's not just passive: it actually reduces the temperature of a warm beverage to something cooler.The only catch is (as I found out) that it requires a low dewpoint.Update:The cooler didn't work all that well out in the desert.  The used flower pots I started with had very little porosity, presumably all the pores had filled with minerals and dirt over time.  Also, the sand wasn't easy to use, so I'd recommend trying small pebbles instead.  You could even fill it with ice just to set the height of the concrete cap.", "title": "Make an Evaporative Terra Cotta Beer Chiller", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Make-an-Evaporative-Terra-Cotta-Beer-Chiller/", "section": "workshop", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "\n          The supplies are pretty simple:a tin can big enough to fit your beverage containeran unglazed terra cotta flower pot big enough to fit the tin can and some sandsome fine-grained sandif your pot has a hole, some sealant and a piece of plastic to cover itFor the sealant, I have been very satisfied with Loctite's Handyman's All-Purpose Adhesive/Sealant (as available from Amazon).

I present to you a product aimed at lowering your winter heating\u00a0bill and carbon footprint\u00a0by generating heat for free using the power of the sun!\nProjects that involve warming air for space heating using the sun are plentiful. However, most of them involve permantly installed flat plate collectors made\u00a0out of soda cans or aluminum downspout. Installing a permanant collector usually means drilling two large holes through the side of your house in order to route the ductwork. My collector mounts just outside a window and can be taken down when the heating season is over. The most invasive part of the installation is the removal of the window's flyscreen.\u00a0Furthermore, the aluminum soffit based absorber plate is much more efficient than soda pop cans or aluminum downspout; you can harvest more heat for a given size of collector. The aluminum soffit based collector is more expensive than a soda can collector but less expensive than an aluminum downspout collector.\nAs an added bonus, this collector does not require electricity or fans or forced air of any kind. The current of air through the collector is driven solely by natural convection. As the sun heats the air in the collector, it rises and escapes through the output vent. As a consequence, cold air is drawn into the collector through the input vent to replace the warmed air. The whole loop continues without the need for fans.\nIf you want to make one of these I suggest you use some\u00a0better quality (more expensive) materials than I did but for this particular project, the\u00a0cost was about $60", "title": "Window Mounted Solar Hot Air Furnace (Aluminum Soffit Based)", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Window-Mounted-Solar-Hot-Air-Furnace-Aluminum-Sof/", "section": "workshop", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I've drawn a\u00a0diagram for you that\u00a0I hope is self\u00a0explanitory but nevertheless I will go through it starting from the cold air intake.\n1) Colder air from the room is drawn in from the intake vent at the bottom of the unit. From there it travels inside the cold air plenum until it reaches the chamber at the front of the unit that is exposed to the sun's rays.\n2) Inside the chamber behind the polycarbonate glazing the sun's rays shine on the black aluminum soffit and heat it up. When the cool air encounters the soffit, it is warmed as it rises through the perforations. This rising air is continually replaced by cooler air being drawn into the cool air intake.\n3)The warmed air travels through the hot air plenum until it is released out into the room through the hot ait outlet.\nThe collector\u00a0unit is ment to hang on a windowsill with the intake and exhaust vents inside the house\u00a0with the rest of it on the outside of the house. The window must be the single hung type; where the pane of glass slides vertically to open and close the window. The collector is built to be the same width as the window opening. When the collector is hung on the windowsill, the window can be closed down onto the collector to sort of \"clamp\" it into place.

If you are fortunate enough to be able to use a south facing window near the ground then all I can say is the bigger, the better. The reason for that is you can use the ground to support your collector and you dont have to worry about weight. You should also use thicker materials, such as 1/2 inch sheeting instead of the 1/4 inch sheeting I used. But beware, collectors mounted close to the ground are at increased risk of shading. You should do the solar site survey (link here) before building the collector.\nMy collector is hung from a second floor window. There is no support from below. Therefore I had to try to reduce it's weight as much as I could. I opted for a shell of 1/4 inch OSB with very little supporting framing. The only framing are small 3/4'' by 3/4'' strips of wood that were ripped down from 1'' by 6'' board. They are installed everywhere along the corners where two sheets of OSB meet.\nThe two \"L\" shaped sides of the collector are cut out of OSB in one piece. This is very important. If the sides of the collector were cut out of two pieces there would be nothing to keep it in shape and it would fold like a book as soon as you picked it up.\nThe whole thing was assembled using wood glue and 18 gauge 5/8'' brad nails. When the foamboard insulation was installed later in construction, I nailed everything over again with 1 1/2'' crown staples.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FCG/1SQV/H6I6WD20/FCG1SQVH6I6WD20.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC6/EQZW/H6I6WD2O/FC6EQZWH6I6WD2O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXG/7BSJ/H6I6WD2L/FXG7BSJH6I6WD2L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNK/1ERQ/H6I6WD2Q/FNK1ERQH6I6WD2Q.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: The Outer Shell"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "The insulation used was 1'' polystyrene.

However, I scoured the city for days in search of polyiso and couldn't find it. I had to settle for polystyrene and who knows, maybe it will work fine.\nThe foamboard was simple to install with little more than a knife\u00a0and a tube of foamboard adhesive. I feel inclined to tell you that you're supposed to pull the board off of the wood after you first glue it and let it air out for five minutes before you stick it back on. However, when I insulated my basement with this stuff years back I purposely didn't\u00a0air out\u00a0a few panels after I glued them and they're stuck on just as good as the rest.\nAfter insulating I sealed up all the joints with tuck tape in order to prevent drafts.\nThe last picture shows what was left over from one 4' by 8' sheet of foamboard.

Now we get down to the real meat and potatoes of this whole thing. The absorber plate is a flat plate-like thing that absorbs the sun's rays, gets hot and passes the heat onto the working medium flowing through it. In our case the working medium is air but it can also be water. There are several types of absorbers that you can use including, solid soffit in a backpass collector, soda pop cans, aluminum downspout, vented soffit and aluminum window screen. I think that vented soffit is the best choice because it's one of the most efficient in terms of how much heat you get, it's easy to build and it's cheaper than window screen and downspout.\nThe vented aluminum soffit is pockmarked with hundreds of little holes called perforations. When the sun shines on the soffit it gets hot. Air is drawn through the perforations and is warmed up in the process. When you as an occupant of the home feels the free heat on your skin it warms you up and makes you happy in the process.\nAnyways, the first step in installing the soffit is to make the spacers. They run the whole length of the OSB divider and are sloped from 1/2 inch at the bottom to 3 inches at the top. I just took some 1 by 6 board, cut it to length on the miter saw, ripped it down to 3 1/2 inches and then ripped that piece down on a diagonal. The two resulting pieces should be near identical with 1/2 inch thickness on one end and 3 inch thickness on the other. Next, they were glued in place with foamboard adhesive and secured with 2 inch 16 gauge brad nails shot in from the outside sheeting.\nThe first piece of soffit was cut to length and then a 3/4'' lip was bent into the tail at the bottom. The lip was made by clamping the soffit to my workbench and using the egde of the workbench as a guide as I went tapping\u00a0along the piece with a hammer. When the first piece of soffit is installed, the lip covers up the air gap between the soffit and the plenum divider.\nTwo more pieces of soffit are cut and installed. They fit together they same way as you would if installing them on a house. Each piece has sort of a \"tongue\" one one edge and \"groove\" on the other. The groove of the first piece accepts the tongue of the second.\nThree pieces were used in all. A 10 foot piece from the hardware store\u00a0was enough to do it all.. About $17 worth.\nAfter all of the soffit was in place, a foamboard cap was made to fit inside the remaining space and glued in place with foamboard adhesive. A piece of 1/4'' OSB was cut to fit over the styrofoam cap leaving an 1 1/4'' of the bottom of the cap exposed. Now the absorber plate has an 1 1/4'' border on all four sides. This is an important feature for the installation of the polycarbonate glazing and the batten trim.\nFInally, the whole absorber plate was painted flat black with a couple cans of spray paint. I should have used the high heat barbecue paint but I couldn't find any.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FA0/S768/H6I6WD7C/FA0S768H6I6WD7C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI1/KAFK/H6I6WD8W/FI1KAFKH6I6WD8W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ6/DLT1/H6I6WD96/FQ6DLT1H6I6WD96.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXE/TYFR/H6I6WD9A/FXETYFRH6I6WD9A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF3/0RQF/H6I6WD9X/FF30RQFH6I6WD9X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVN/RZ76/H6I6WDA1/FVNRZ76H6I6WDA1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHK/JMI6/H6I6WDAR/FHKJMI6H6I6WDAR.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: The Aluminum Soffit Absorber Plate"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "The first thing I did was make a frame on the face of the collector out of 3/8'' by 1/2'' strips. They are 3/8'' thick to match the thickness of the twin wall polycarbonate glazing and they are 1/2'' wide to cover up the OSB sides while leaving 3/4'' of foamboard exposed all the way around. The twin wall glazing is known to have good thermal insulation properties. The glazing rests only on foamboard all the way around in order to keep the presence of\u00a0insulation seamless between the foamboard and the glazing.\nThe glazing was cut with my circular saw with a special \"plastic panel\" cutting blade. It was cut 1/4'' by 1/4'' smaller than the opening of the frame to allow for thermal expansion. While cutting, it is a good idea to leave the plastic film on both sides on, in order to prevent burrs from forming. Make sure you cut so that the cells are\u00a0oriented vertically.\u00a0There is one side only that can be facing the sun's rays. It is usually marked by the plastic film that covers it. After cutting, peel away one corner of the film on the UV protected side, mark the panel with a piece of masking tape and peel off the rest of the film.\nAfter cutting, take the blow gun from you air compressor and blow out all of the dust in each cell of the sheeting. Then seal the two ends with dust tape (also called vent tape or ventilated tape).\nThe polycarbonate glazing can then be laid inside the frame and then secured with the batten trim. The batten trim is 1 1/4'' by 3/4'' strips ripped down from 1 by 6 board. It is cut to fit around the polycarbonate glazing in a frame with miterd corners. The batten trim is secured down with wood glue and brad nails.\nFInally, a bead of exterior caulking is run around the inside of the batten trim between the trim and the glazing.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8I/GJDW/H6I6WDBS/F8IGJDWH6I6WDBS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP6/WIRK/H6I6WDBX/FP6WIRKH6I6WDBX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIR/E4Q6/H6I6WDBY/FIRE4Q6H6I6WDBY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC0/27Q9/H6I6WDBZ/FC027Q9H6I6WDBZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9T/ITM8/H6I6WDC1/F9TITM8H6I6WDC1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAI/1ZEH/H6I6WDCB/FAI1ZEHH6I6WDCB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEJ/CFNT/H6I6WDCG/FEJCFNTH6I6WDCG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Installing the Polycarbonate Glazing"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "When I got home from work late the next sunny evening I decided to prop the collector up in the sun and see how well it would do. I was very pleased with the initial results.\nFirst of all, it was late in the evening so the sun was hanging low in the sky very far to the west. The collector recieved very little direct sunlight because of a lot of low lying clouds hanging around the sun. Most of the sunlight that reached the collector was partially filtered through the thin cloud cover.\u00a0In addition, it was hard to avoid the shadows of my neighbor's shed as well as a nearby tree and telephone pole. Needless to say, conditions were less than ideal.\nNevertheless, the thing worked. Even without a fan there was a decent amount of warm air rising up out of the exhaust opening of the collector. However, I read that forced air dramatically increases the output of these collectors so with the rapidly setting sun, I scrambled to tear apart an old junk computer to get out the (very large) cooling fan. I quickly made up a piece of OSB that was larger than the exhaust opening of the collector and drilled a hole in it the same size as the fan. With the sheet of OSB over the exhaust opening and the fan over that drawing air through the collector and out the top, I was amazed with the results.\nFor a short period of time thereafter, the collector was recieveing full direct sunlight and I must say, the\u00a0heat was bailing out of that thing. It felt like just as much output (in terms of both temperature and flow rate) as a 240 volt forced air electric heater such as the ones that are installed in my house for space heating. In other words, it felt like I had my hand in front of one of those heaters while it was running.\nBefore I could get my thermometers out it clouded over again. The output\u00a0temperature dropped my a large margin. With the thermometers in place I measured a steady 12oC at the intake and 20oC at the exhaust. All with a good airflow; about the same as what comes out of a clothes\u00a0dryer vent. Sorry, but I don't have any way of measuring and quantifing air flow yet. As a result, I also cannot calculate the power of the unit in terms of the rate that it is collecting heat energy from the sun.\nAll that being said, I am confident that this collector will provide %100 of the heat required to keep a room warm during a sunny, clear winter day. Given that I cost approximately $60 in materials, it should pay for itself about\u00a0three times each heating season depending on the weather.\nAs soon as I get this thing mounted in the window, I will see how it does with heating the room. I actually expect it to perform better in December than now in September because the sun still tracks fairly high in the sky and makes a rather high incidence angle with the vertical collector. In December, the low tracking sun will shine almost straight onto the collector, increasing the output.\nUnfortunately, I will not be home while the sun is shining on the collector until\u00a0a while after\u00a0the dedline for this contest. I will update this insructable with my results the minute I get them.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FCP/640O/H6MERA07/FCP640OH6MERA07.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOF/2HLC/H6MERA0J/FOF2HLCH6MERA0J.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: The Initial Test"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Before I had this thing hanging out my window for all of my neighborhood to see I wanted it to look a little more \"finished\" than an OSB box.

But because of some mechanical challenges with the experiment, there are some datapoints that clearly don't fit the trend (for example, the maximum acceleration). This brings us to question how do we deal with those outliers? It is really tempting to hide them... There are NO shortcuts in science!E. Trend lines: With just 4 temperatures, we can see that there is a trend, start by fitting a straight line, not bad but we can do better. The hottest datapoint is not as powerful as we would predict. We can discuss what happens at the extreme temperatures (Coke boils, bottle explodes), and what should happen as we approach that natural limit. How can we use the formula generated from the experiments? Can we predict an outcome?F. Law of Diminishing Returns: We can add energy as heat the the bottles to get more and more thrust, but we gain less and less punch as we do this. The trendline is going to reach a maximum thrust and become asymptotic to that limit. Is there a practical temperature that is optimal?This was a great activity on a warm summer day, and we had a blast doing actual science!

Then i thought i would share the idea here.. so as a matter of interest i would go ask the big ugly text books what they thought..... turns out they kinda agree;Apparently at sea level the \"weight \" of pressure is approx 101 kPa (14 lbs/ sq inch), at 10m (33 feet) it increases by a further 101 kPa (14 lbs/sq inch) or doubles in pressure. Boyles Law is the technical version..  but as i understand it, a drop by 10m below sea level and the volume of air will be squeezed in to half the volume....:-) all the while busy pushing back at the water twice as hard..(any divers in the room?)I found a pressure calculator  and was able to establish the pressure at approx 1m below sea level would be 111 kPa(16.1psi) and just possibly that would mean the air would be compressed by a factor of 1.15 .. ...so in theory the dry zone of the cache would be able to fight back enough to keep itself dry.. the more the water on top the better it would be able to... and equally any warm air trapped inside that cooled to produce condensation (the biggest problem on land i face!) is free to drip down and rejoin its kin...and be drained at low tide...So....the easy version;When the tide comes in it, it enters the large container and as its level rises in the large container the air above halve way is unable to escape, at some point as the water covers the container the water pressure starts to compress the air remaining - meaning at some point their will be some push back by the air remaining that will ensure water stays away from the small inner container containing the log - and the small log container prevents condensation damage?Or is it all down to the fact that the location means the caches are just not opened regularly enough to create a condensation issue?", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FV9/W9XP/IRO1G86H/FV9W9XPIRO1G86H.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: How It Works"}], "channel": "Sports"}, {"category": "play", "description": "Hello so today I am going to show you how to make a lava floor in MCPE.

That was measured at the airport, several miles away.  I think we got less than that.  Anyway, my house is roughly 40x60', and the gutter system looks like it splits the perimeter in half, which is 1200 sqft.  I collected about 80 gal.  You can see that when we have a storm during which we get half or a whole inch of rain, the overflow system will be needed.The water color was quite brown, which I think is due to bits of leaves that colored the gutters last year before I cleaned them out.  It's kind of gross, but the tomatoes don't seem to care.UPDATE: Yes, the gutter had a lot of maple seeds and flowers from this spring, which was the reason for the color of the water.  I was surprised at the amount of stuff up there because I'd cleaned them out several times last fall.  Turns out it was all fresh from this spring.I tested the overflow while cleaning the gutters.  Works well engough, but a static load is probably not a good idea.  I had the PVC pipe hanging on the overflow output, which was enough weight to bend it down a bit.I decided to give up on the landscaping cloth for a filter.  Not only did it not work, I had mosquitoes hatching out in just a few DAYS!  Instead, I got mosquito-proof screen.  That keeps them in if they're in and out if they're out.After using my rain-collection barrel, I would recommend you look for more clever plumbing.  I've seen some really good designs that eliminate the amount of water that's left in the barrel.  I have 10-20 gallons that I can't get out,  Also, my capacity is lower that 110 gal because the one barrel was cut off (in a previous life it was an in-garage compost bin for several winters).Also, use a 3/4 spigot if you can manage.  When the water gets low, it takes almost 45 sec/gal to fill a watering can.After going to some pains to have a gravity-feed system, I discovered that I like watering plants with a watering can because I have a better idea of the amount of water the plant is getting.

Whatever your cooking needs, this outdoor oven can do it, thanks to interchangeable grill grates and griddle surfaces. If you want to grill steaks or fish, use the grill grate. If you want to bake bread, slide on the steel griddle, stack some bricks on top to retain heat and add the door to hold in the heat. If you want to use the stove top, just slide the metal plate (or griddle) over the top of the firebox.\n\u00a0The oven has a thick insulation layer of lightweight perlite/cement between the firebox and surrounding concrete block, and we included a removable door. This design holds the heat in the firebox where it\u2019s needed. (Perlite is the porous white stuff often found in potting soils. You can buy this mined mineral product at garden centers.)\n\u00a0You can build the outdoor oven in stages, a few hours at a time. (You\u2019ll need a few days between some steps.) Check local building codes before you start building. The oven is made from materials you can buy at local hardware or building stores. You may be able to find some of the materials at a salvage yard, too. Even if you only use it to bake bread, you can save enough money in one year to more than pay for the $300 cost. Ideally, the stove is built to a comfortable height with concrete countertop space on each side, plus a roof to protect against the elements. We covered the concrete blocks with tile, primarily for aesthetic reasons, but you could apply stucco over the blocks, or just paint them. Having an outdoor sink and storage space nearby is also convenient.\n\u00a0Another key design element is the firebox size \u2014 not too small, not too large, but just right. Properly sized fireboxes heat up quickly, have improved combustion, produce less smoke and stay hotter longer. We measured cookie sheets, bread pans, medium and large roasting pans, canners and baking dishes to arrive at our optimal firebox size of 13 inches wide by 28 inches deep by 13\u00bd inches high.\n\u00a0Our outdoor oven requires a fire in the firebox for about 45 minutes to one hour to reach a baking temperature of 450 to 500 degrees Fahrenheit. Or, if you want to grill, you can start in less than half an hour. The stove requires almost no maintenance. There\u2019s no need to clean grease out of the oven because it will simply burn away next time you use it.\n\u00a0To read more, including tips on cooking with this oven, see this article at the MOTHER EARTH NEWS website.", "title": "All-in-One Outdoor Oven, Stove, Grill and Smoker", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/All-in-One-Outdoor-Oven-Stove-Grill-and-Smoker/", "section": "home", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "<!--\n /* Style Definitions */\n p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal\n\t{mso-style-parent:\"\";\n\tmargin:0in;\n\tmargin-bottom:.0001pt;\n\tmso-pagination:widow-orphan;\n\tfont-size:12.0pt;\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\n\tmso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\np\n\t{mso-margin-top-alt:auto;\n\tmargin-right:0in;\n\tmso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;\n\tmargin-left:0in;\n\tmso-pagination:widow-orphan;\n\tfont-size:12.0pt;\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\n\tmso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\n@page Section1\n\t{size:8.5in 11.0in;\n\tmargin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in;\n\tmso-header-margin:.5in;\n\tmso-footer-margin:.5in;\n\tmso-paper-source:0;}\ndiv.Section1\n\t{page:Section1;}\n-->53 medium-duty firebricks (2\ufffd in. by 4\ufffd in. by 9 in.) \n28\ufffdconcrete blocks (4 in. by 8 in. by 16 in.)\n12 concrete half block 4 in. by 8 in. by 8 in.\n4 80-lb. bags cement \n1 80-lb. bag\ufffdcement mortar for tile and block\n2 wheelbarrows of sand\n2 wheelbarrows of gravel\n1 2-gal. bucket fine sand\n3 13-lb. bags\ufffdperlite\n1 quarter-inch steel lintel (1\ufffd\ufffd in. by 14\ufffd\ufffd in. by 18 in.)\n1 small bag concrete pigment\n10 ft. of 6-in. stovepipe\n1 damper\n1chimney cap\n1 collar\n1 tube\ufffdsilicone\n38 sq. ft. tile (for four sides)\ufffd\n4 to 5 lbs.\ufffdgrout\n1 steel griddle (\ufffd in. by 15 in. by 18 in.)\n1 steel grill grate (15 in. by 18 in.)\n1 grate (fridge/oven rack) (13 in. by 18 in. max)\n36 in. stove gasket (optional seal)\n1 metal insulated door with handles/vent<!--\n /* Style Definitions */\n p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal\n\t{mso-style-parent:\"\";\n\tmargin:0in;\n\tmargin-bottom:.0001pt;\n\tmso-pagination:widow-orphan;\n\tfont-size:12.0pt;\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\n\tmso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\np\n\t{mso-margin-top-alt:auto;\n\tmargin-right:0in;\n\tmso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;\n\tmargin-left:0in;\n\tmso-pagination:widow-orphan;\n\tfont-size:12.0pt;\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\n\tmso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\n@page Section1\n\t{size:8.5in 11.0in;\n\tmargin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in;\n\tmso-header-margin:.5in;\n\tmso-footer-margin:.5in;\n\tmso-paper-source:0;}\ndiv.Section1\n\t{page:Section1;}\n-->53 medium-duty firebricks (2\u00bd in. by 4\u00bd in. by 9 in.) \n28\u00a0concrete blocks (4 in. by 8 in. by 16 in.)\n12 concrete half block 4 in. by 8 in. by 8 in.\n4 80-lb. bags cement \n1 80-lb. bag\u00a0cement mortar for tile and block\n2 wheelbarrows of sand\n2 wheelbarrows of gravel\n1 2-gal. bucket fine sand\n3 13-lb. bags\u00a0perlite\n1 quarter-inch steel lintel (1\u00bd\u00a0 in. by 14\u00be\u00a0 in. by 18 in.)\n1 small bag concrete pigment\n10 ft. of 6-in. stovepipe\n1 damper\n1chimney cap\n1 collar\n1 tube\u00a0silicone\n38 sq. ft. tile (for four sides)\u00a0\n4 to 5 lbs.\u00a0grout\n1 steel griddle (\u00bc in. by 15 in. by 18 in.)\n1 steel grill grate (15 in. by 18 in.)\n1 grate (fridge/oven rack) (13 in. by 18 in. max)\n36 in. stove gasket (optional seal)\n1 metal insulated door with handles/ventTotal cost: $300.

A low-cost rubble trench foundation is recommended for most situations. The specifics will vary due to climate and soil conditions, but a rubble trench is usually 18 to 24 inches deep and filled with gravel, or gravel and stone. If you\u2019re building the stove in a harsh climate with strong freeze-thaw cycles, add a French drain (a small valley filled with stones) to remove moisture. Raise the building site if necessary to avoid moisture problems.For our rubble trench foundation, we used chunks of recycled broken concrete, also known as \u201curbancrete,\u201d instead of stone. Concrete chunks from flatwork slabs, such as sidewalks and driveways, work best. They can be recycled and stacked like stone. Stack these up in layers to the top of the trench. Fill gaps with gravel and then tamp solid.\nOn top of the rubble trench, pour a 3\u00bd -inch by 40-inch by 40-inch concrete pad. This will create a strong, level foundation for your stove. Make sure the pad is level and square. (We poured an entire concrete floor for our outdoor kitchen instead of a just a small leveling pad, but the concept is the same.)\n\n\n\n        ", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F76/KYWD/G7YFVV5N/F76KYWDG7YFVV5N.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Set the Foundation"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "<!--\n /* Style Definitions */\n p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal\n\t{mso-style-parent:\"\";\n\tmargin:0in;\n\tmargin-bottom:.0001pt;\n\tmso-pagination:widow-orphan;\n\tfont-size:12.0pt;\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\n\tmso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\np\n\t{mso-margin-top-alt:auto;\n\tmargin-right:0in;\n\tmso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;\n\tmargin-left:0in;\n\tmso-pagination:widow-orphan;\n\tfont-size:12.0pt;\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\n\tmso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\n@page Section1\n\t{size:8.5in 11.0in;\n\tmargin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in;\n\tmso-header-margin:.5in;\n\tmso-footer-margin:.5in;\n\tmso-paper-source:0;}\ndiv.Section1\n\t{page:Section1;}\n-->The next step is to build a concrete-block base two courses high with ladder reinforcement (a wire mesh designed to add strength and prevent cracking) between each course. Use 4-inch by 8-inch by 16-inch blocks with a few half blocks as needed. No cuts are required in the base if you follow the plans. Be sure to lay the block as perfectly plumb, straight and square as possible. Allow to dry for two days or so to gain strength.Fill the base with gravel or a mixture of sand and gravel. Fill the base with two 6-inch layers, tamping each layer gently. Go easy on the tamping so as not to strain the concrete block joints. All you\u2019re trying to do is settle the materials.Complete the base by pouring a 4-inch layer of lightweight cement level with the top of the block base. This creates a strong, insulated layer under your firebox. Perlite is perfect for high-heat applications such as this. (According to the Perlite Institute, perlite is used to make gas fireplace logs.) Perlite mix for base: 1 1/3 bags cement, 13 pounds perlite and water. This cement-rich mix is strong enough to support the heavy load of firebricks and countertop, yet also insulate the firebox from the mass below.

Place a half-inch layer of fine, clean sand on top of the lightweight cement. We screened our own sand (one two-gallon bucket) through fine mesh. Use a straight edge to make it as level as possible. Precise leveling is a critical step that determines the accuracy of the firebox.The first layer of firebrick creates the hearth. Standard firebrick size is 2\u00bd inches by 4\u00bd inches by 9 inches. The\u00a0front row of firebricks\u00a0is perpendicular to the other firebricks and extends 2 inches beyond the concrete block (see photo, above). This makes it easy to sweep coals and ashes into a bucket. We added half-inch concrete board shims under the front edge for stability, where sand would fall away.All firebricks are placed without mortar so they are free to expand and contract. The placement technique involves carefully sliding each firebrick straight down \u2014 one against the other \u2014 into place to avoid gaps. After the first course is set, use the end of your hammer handle to tap on any high spots until all firebricks are flush with each other.Measure the front of the base and find the center, which should be about 20 inches from either side. Start the first layer of firebricks by placing two bricks on either side of the center of the base, making sure that the brick hang over the front about 2 inches. (The first layer of firebricks should be 8\u00bd\u00a0 inches from the back and 11 inches from the side of the base \u2014 if you follow the diagram instead of the photos.)I made a last-minute decision to lengthen the firebox by 4\u00bd inches (one firebrick width). In hindsight, this probably wasn\u2019t the best choice because now we have minimal insulation on the back of the firebox. My advice is to use one less row of firebricks than shown in the photos. So the hearth will have 14 firebricks, not 16 as shown in the photos. The drawing shows the recommended approach, and the materials list below is based on this smaller firebox.Continue stacking firebricks for the sides of the firebox. These are\u00a0stacked on edge as shown above. The firebox is easy to build and the bricks can be stacked in about one hour. You may encounter a few firebricks that are not perfectly sized. Buy a few extra so you have spares.

Let the block dry for two to three days.\nYou\u2019ll need a right angle grinder or wet saw to cut a few concrete blocks around the front of the firebox. Both tools will do the job, but my preference is a right angle grinder because of its low cost, ease of use and versatility. (You also might be able to rent one for this project.) We used it to cut CEBs for the wall behind our kitchen, steel reinforcement, tile and concrete blocks.

We chose poured-in-place concrete countertops for their strength, and resistance to heat and moisture damage. For instance, we don\u2019t have to worry if a storm blows some rain into the kitchen. Strength is important so we can clamp a grain grinder to the countertop, an important issue if you\u2019re going to bake healthy breads. Our countertop design holds the firebricks in place. Although hot pads are typically used, we don\u2019t have to worry about setting down hot pans hurriedly or otherwise be overly concerned about damaging the surface. Tile is also very practical, but we used it on the sides of the stove and wanted something different on top. Stone is another good choice, but too expensive for our budget.We were looking for an inexpensive way to make concrete countertops and came up with a pretty good solution at a fraction of the cost of custom made countertops \u2014 about $20 instead of $2,000. (This cost is for 12\u00bd lineal feet of 25\u00bd-inch countertops.)\nWe used 100 percent scrap materials for forming, about a half bag of cement, some quarter-inch rebar, and baling wire, sand, gravel and iron oxide pigment. Forms consisted of leftover eighth-inch cement board and scrap wood. We placed rebar in a grid pattern and then poured concrete on top. Create an eighth-inch space between chimney and countertop with a removable shim to allow for expansion and contraction. As the concrete set up, we used an edging tool to round the edges. Pigment was troweled on the surface as the concrete started to set up. It only takes a tiny amount of pigment sprinkled here and there to create a beautiful color. After the forms were stripped in three days and the edges touched up, we applied a \u201cpaint\u201d of iron oxide mixed with water to the edges. You might want to splurge an extra $10 to $20 and add pigment to the entire mix to make integrally colored concrete.   \n\n\n\n        ", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FH4/R5D7/G7YFZY9V/FH4R5D7G7YFZY9V.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Build the Countertop"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "<!--\n /* Style Definitions */\n p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal\n\t{mso-style-parent:\"\";\n\tmargin:0in;\n\tmargin-bottom:.0001pt;\n\tmso-pagination:widow-orphan;\n\tfont-size:12.0pt;\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\n\tmso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\np\n\t{mso-margin-top-alt:auto;\n\tmargin-right:0in;\n\tmso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;\n\tmargin-left:0in;\n\tmso-pagination:widow-orphan;\n\tfont-size:12.0pt;\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\n\tmso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\n@page Section1\n\t{size:8.5in 11.0in;\n\tmargin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in;\n\tmso-header-margin:.5in;\n\tmso-footer-margin:.5in;\n\tmso-paper-source:0;}\ndiv.Section1\n\t{page:Section1;}\n-->Building the chimney is straightforward.

You can get creative with tile, and it\u2019s a good value. To decide on the color, bring samples home from the store and see what looks best. You might want to choose tile in advance and make slight adjustments to the stove size for a perfect fit. You can tweak sizes of concrete block joints to get tile to fit perfectly and reduce the amount of tile cutting. You can also apply stucco to the concrete blocks or simply paint them.To apply tile, first scrape the block wall clean of concrete residue. Use a drop cloth to protect the floor. Line up the tile to determine even spacing. Draw a level line around the stove as a guideline for the first row. (We started at the base on the front.) Mix a bucket of mortar, brush water on the back of each tile (or soak tile in water) and trowel on about three-eighths inch of mortar with a pointed trowel. Taper the edges, and lightly press each tile into place. Check for alignment in each direction. A few light taps of your trowel handle will seat the tile firmly in place. Check again for plumb, level, even spacing and to ensure the tile is in the same plane as the stove. It helps to change your angle of view and sight lengthwise along the surface periodically.Allow the tile to set up a bit and then work grout into the joints with a rubber grout float. Do one section at a time, smoothing the joints and cleaning the surfaces in stages with a sponge. Squeeze out extra moisture from the sponge so the joints aren\u2019t weakened by too much water getting into the grout.

The key is to ask yourself what you cannot, or do not want to, live without. For us, the answer is water.\nWhether you live off-grid or in the city, having rain water catchment and a tank is not a bad idea, if only as a backup. Most urban water reaches the home using electricity, so if the power fails, so does your source of water. Furthermore, there are times when your pipes can freeze, again cutting off your water. If you have a tank on your property, you can, at the very least, go and manually get a bucket of water for general sanitation.\nWhen providing your own water system - whether as your main supply, a backup or for fish or irrigation - the bulk of your efforts should go towards storage, or a tank, as that is the most costly part.\nPlastic tanks are easy to set up, but they are very expensive in larger sizes. Concrete ones are durable, but ill advised for any beginner, as they are prone to leaks if not done correctly, especially where the walls and floor meet. We have found that the shell and liner system described in this article is by far the best option for us. It's cheap, easy (even for just two people), and quick.\nFor information about how to harvest the rain from your roof to fill your tank, see here. For further information on cisterns, click here.

The larger it is, the faster water will come out, but the more expensive your pipes will be. Generally, pipes to a house are either 1/2\" or 3/4\". You want the outlet to be as low to the floor as you can get, and in a location that is convenient to wherever you want to use the water. On our tanks, we use 1 1/2\" outlet sizes, to be able to hook multiple tanks together.Overflow: The size of the overflow depends on the source of water that will be filling the cistern. For a rain catchment system, your overflow wants to be able to match or exceed the size of pipes going from your gutters to the tank. At least 3\" is recommended, although more if the catchment area is very large and you experience heavy, fast rains. The overflow point will want to go as close to the top of the walls as you can make it. Think about where you want the overflow to go - whether to another cistern, an orchard, or somewhere else that can safely handle the excess water - and place it accordingly.\nPlease note, that in this system the overflow point and the overflow pipe are 2 different things. Because we have a self cleaning overflow design, the overflow point is actually higher than the pipe hole in the metal wall.\n\t\tTo position the overflow hole (where the overflow pipe goes through the wall), hold a 3\" T against the side of the wall. The T should be on it's side, so that the long part is vertical. The bottom of the small side part is the overflow level. Make this about 4 inches below the top of the tank. This is the overflow point. Mark this spot with a marker.\n\t\tCut a 4\" piece of 3\" PVC. On one end of this piece, put a 3\" elbow. On the other end, place another elbow, but turn it 90 degrees compared to the first elbow.\n\t\tLine the top elbow up so the bottom of its side hole is lined up with your overflow point. The bottom elbow should be facing the wall. Draw a circle around the elbow. This marks your overflow hole.\n\t\tNow, position the bulkhead fitting over this hole, and draw a line around it so that the line is slightly bigger than the threads on the fitting. Cut out this hole.\n\t\tFor the outlet hole, hold the 1 1/2\" bulkhead in place, about 1\" from the bottom of the tank. Draw a line around the threads of the bulkhead. This is the outlet hole.\n\t\tDrill out each hole with a metal hole saw. If you don't have a hole saw that fits the size perfectly, use a jigsaw with a metal blade. Drill a 3/8\" hole on the inside edge of your line, and then use this hole to start cutting along the line.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FAE/DW57/H994S5UT/FAEDW57H994S5UT.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Plumbing Part 1"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "\n\t\tFold five strips of vinyl tarp, 4.5ft long and a couple of inches wide.\n\t\tLine these strips over each set of bolts, to protect the liner from any rough edges of the bolts.

This will still allow for enough clearance for the barrel to sit on the box without the spigot being difficult to reach while still allowing the vast majority of the water in the barrel to drain out. With the spigot I bought, a 1/2 inch forstner bit was an almost perfect fit, though I still had to expand it with a rotary tool just a little bit in order to make it fit perfectly.Next, break out the two part epoxy and apply one part to half of the threaded spigot base, and apply the other part to the other half of the threaded spigot base. As you screw the spigot into your hole the epoxy will mix itself and do the work for you! If you want, it may not be a bad idea to spread a little extra epoxy on the outside, just to give it a little more support. I used an adjustable wrench to tighten the spigot down extra tight.

Then came the day that the weatherman predicted that we'd get 1/2 inch of rain that night and the showers were likely to start some time in the early afternoon. I had no choice. I had to finish this project right away or risk losing all that water. Unfortunately it started raining as I was completing this final step, and I had no one to help or take pictures so the next two steps will be a little more spartan than the others. I still think you can get the idea though...The first thing you'll need is an easy way to get the water from your downspout to your rain barrel. If you've got some old gutter pieces laying around you may be able to fashion something from these, but if you need to buy something new I would suggest going with a piece of SOLID Flex-Drain pipe. I got mine at my local Lowe's for a little less than $10 (USD). The kind I bought is only 3 feet long when compressed, but can stretch out to it's full length of 12 feet very easily. I couldn't find anything that would easily work as a reducer so that meant I would need to cut the existing hole in the barrel to fit the flex tubing.I used a battery powered reciprocating saw to cut the hole but, if I had not been pressed for time and inclement weather, a coping saw would have worked out a lot better. Sure it would have taken more time, but I would have had better control and it wouldn't have wound up looking as awful as it did.

Some modifications I plan on making in the future are:1. An overflow valve. The first night of operation I gathered 55 gallons of water and the rest just flowed over the top of the barrel. I would have preferred the water to have gone out the side through a piece of PVC pipe and back to where the downspout originally drained (onto the root system of a beautiful mimosa tree).2. Screens. To avoid any mosquito problems I have put in some of the anti-mosquito granules you can buy at Lowe's but this isn't an optimal solution. What I would like to do is fasten a piece of screen over the hole to prevent them from getting to the water in the first place.3. Quick Connector. Screwing the hose on and off of the barrel is kind of a pain in the tookus. I'm building a square foot garden about 2 feet away so I don't need much hose to begin with, but I think it would spare me lots of frustration if I could just walk up to it, slap on the hose, do my watering, and disconnect it just as easily.Like I said in the beginning of this Instructable, this is not the best rain barrel design out there. Many of the other projects were raised higher off the ground to encourage more pressure coming from the spigot, many were angled to increase pressure and water drainage, and some were even designed to supply water for more than just watering plants (car cleaning, toilet flushing, etc.). This Instructable, however, was meant to show a fast, easy way to collect and utilize water from the sky. I tried to stay in line with the K.I.S.S. philosophy as much as possible. The total cost for this project was $22.37 (including tax) but that will vary from user to user as some supplies you may already have on hand, and some you will have to pay for.

It is important that we work together to help improve the future by looking after the environment, but what can be done to help? One thing is to make a rain barrel! Before we learn to make a rain barrel it is important to understand what a rain barrel is and why it is important. What is a rain barrel? A rain barrel is a barrel used as a cistern to hold water [1]. Rain barrels work by collecting water typically from roof downspouts where they store the water for future use. Rain barrels come in many different sizes and can be made from a lot of different containers, but today we are going to use a 55 gallon pickle barrel. Why are rain barrels useful? Rain barrels are useful because they help prevent storm water runoff from flowing into lakes, rivers, streams, etc. This helps prevent erosion and maintain strong local infrastructures. They are also helpful because they allow people to water flowers, wash cars, water lawns, etc. without using tap water [2].", "title": "How to Make a Rain Barrel From a Pickle Barrel", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-a-Rain-Barrel-From-a-Pickle-Barrel/", "section": "home", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Parts Needed -1 1\u201d threaded female adapter -1 1\" threaded male\u00a0adapter -1 55 gallon pickling barrel (or any food grade plastic barrel) -2-3 Cement blocks -Hardware cloth -1 1\u201d faucet -6 \u00a0zinc/stainless steel bolts -6 zinc/stainless steel nuts -Teflon plumbers tape -Silicone rubber sealant -24' corrugated hose -1 1 1/4\" NPT male adapter -1 steel hose clamp Tools Needed -1\" spade drill bit -1 1/4\" spade drill bit -Drill -Jig Saw or reciprocating saw -Scissors (not all tools and parts shown in below image)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJN/2LYA/HFPTEC95/FJN2LYAHFPTEC95.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Parts and Tools Needed"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "-Use the 1\" spade bit to drill a hole 6\" from the bottom of the barrel for the faucet -Wrap the 1\" faucet with the\u00a0Teflon\u00a0tape and then screw on the 1\" threaded female adapter\u00a0 -Push the threaded part of the threaded male adapter through the drilled hole from the inside of \u00a0the barrel -Screw the threaded female adapter/faucet onto the threaded end of the threaded male adapter -Apply the silicone rubber sealant around the base of the outside components -The faucet is now istalled", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FHO/Q6DI/HFPTEC9O/FHOQ6DIHFPTEC9O.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Installing the Faucet"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "-Use 1 1/4\" spade drill bit to drill a hole 6\" from the top of the barrel -Push 1 1/4\" adapter through the hole\u00a0 -Attach the corrugated hose to the adapter -Attach the steel hose clamp where the corrugated hose goes over the adapter -The overflow is installed", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F6Z/P91E/HFPTECAH/F6ZP91EHFPTECAH.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Installing Overflow"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "-Use the jigsaw/reciprocating\u00a0saw to cut a hole out of the lid -Use scissors to cut the hardware cloth into a circle the size of the inside of the lid -After placing the hardware cloth in the lid, while holding it taught, drill 6 equally spaced holes through the cloth and inner lip of the lid -Push the bolts through the drilled holes and screw the nuts on from the other side -Place the lid/screen back on the barrel and screw the ring back on, securing the screen.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FGE/AHFP/HFSHELHL/FGEAHFPHFSHELHL.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Installing the Screen"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "-Place your cement blocks equally apart under where you plan to collect water -Gently lift your rain barrel on to the blocks (make sure your faucet and overflow are facing the\u00a0desired\u00a0direction)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSJ/ZKU0/HFSHEK0U/FSJZKU0HFSHEK0U.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Cement Blocks"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Congratulations!

A long hose is included so you can site your waterbutt further from the downpipe if you want to.The filter unit allows 90% of the water to pass to the butt, ensuring quick filling even with only light rainfall.\nIf the filter unit is correctly installed at the right height, the butt will only fill to the top, avoiding overflows. The bottom of the filter unit should be approx 5cm below the top edge of the water butt: the butt will only be filled to this level, and thereafter water will be directed straight down the downpipe.               \n\n\n\n        ", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FNF/XE60/G7WVIGEV/FNFXE60G7WVIGEV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Blurb"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Here's what should be in the box", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FNG/7ME2/G7X76SO7/FNG7ME2G7X76SO7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYW/ID7U/G7WVIGFL/FYWID7UG7WVIGFL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYB/WF7F/G7WVDGF3/FYBWF7FG7WVDGF3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0Z/PJ3V/G7WVIGFP/F0ZPJ3VG7WVIGFP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F45/EMTF/G7WVDGF4/F45EMTFG7WVDGF4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG1/VV0P/G7X76SO4/FG1VV0PG7X76SO4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRZ/WCYE/G7WVGRKY/FRZWCYEG7WVGRKY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1M/RZPL/G7WVDGFI/F1MRZPLG7WVDGFI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FT5/MGGD/G7WVGRL0/FT5MGGDG7WVGRL0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVO/I3IR/G7WVIGFU/FVOI3IRG7WVIGFU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Bits and Pieces"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "<!--\n /* Style Definitions */\n p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal\n\t{mso-style-parent:\"\";\n\tmargin:0cm;\n\tmargin-bottom:.0001pt;\n\tmso-pagination:widow-orphan;\n\tfont-size:12.0pt;\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\n\tmso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\n@page Section1\n\t{size:612.0pt 792.0pt;\n\tmargin:72.0pt 90.0pt 72.0pt 90.0pt;\n\tmso-header-margin:36.0pt;\n\tmso-footer-margin:36.0pt;\n\tmso-paper-source:0;}\ndiv.Section1\n\t{page:Section1;}\n-->Before you start to install the rainwater filter, you need to have your water butt in place in its final position.

It is not perfect for a greenhouse (only receiving 4-5 hours of full daylight a day), but it is the best we have. The shape of the ground makes an ordinary greenhouse difficult. Also, I have a love for Geodesic domes. Since the piece of land is already round, it made sense to make a Geodesic dome. I love domes because they are ridiculously strong and efficient. All struts are only every pushed or pulled on. No bending load ever goes through a strut. Also, the structure of a geodesic dome looks very complicated, but is actually easier to build, because it is massively over-defined. You only need to cut the struts to length and remember the pattern to completely build it. No tape measure is ever needed during construction.", "title": "3m Geodesic Dome Greenhouse", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/3m-Geodesic-Dome-Greenhouse/", "section": "home", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "First some theory and material choices. A geodesic dome is not difficult to make, but a few things need to be understood before making one. MaterialsLets start with the foundation. The dome needs to be anchored to the ground in a proper way. It is easy to skimp out on this part, since you will not see it later, but a strong foundation is what makes something last. How you do it depends on how long you want your greenhouse to last. Here in the Netherlands, concrete gravel tiles are easily obtainable for free. They were popular once, but not any more, and when people get them out of their garden, you can usually pick them up for free. This is a win-win, you get free tiles, and they don't have to take their tiles anywhere (weighing 30kg each).The frame is the part you will see, so aside from just strength, aesthetics may also be a consideration. The beauty of the dome is its strength, so you will quickly pick something too strong. Bear in mind that what you pick will need to be: A. easy to work with, and B. cheap. You are going to need a lot of it. My choice was simple pine wood, 28mm by 44mm. It costs around 1 Euro per meter and is more than strong enough.The covering for the greenhouse is the last material being discussed here. There are 3 paths you can take here: Glass, polycarbonate and foil. In decreasing order, they last, centuries, decades and years. I would love to pick glass, but it is also the most expensive. Polycarbonate you pick if you want to make a well insulated greenhouse, but the cheapest by far is the foil. It is easy to work with and is relatively cheap. When picking foil, do pick greenhouse foil. It is made to withstand UV radiation.constructionTwo compromises need to be made in the construction. The first is the bottom spacer. The radius of the dome is roughly 1,5m. This would also have been the height. I am 1,95m and I want to be able to stand in the greenhouse. With no other solutions, a 0,6m spaces is needed at the bottom. This raises the start of the dome, but is also a structural weakness. The dome itself is very rigid, but the spaces, consisting mostly of squares, is kinda wobbly. The second compromise is the door. In an ideal situation, there are no interruptions in the frame of the dome. The door is a giant gaping hole. Extra wood was added around this area, but even then, it is still the weakest point. The corner block are the most varied part of the dome. Everyone has a different system, and all of the different systems have their own drawbacks. My choice as 2 1cm thick plywood disks, one 15cm and one 8cm. When these are stacked, they give a roughly 17 degree angle. The 2V dome that is being built here needs either 15.86 degrees or 18 degrees, so it is perfect. The struts are attached from the back with screws. Making a window in a geodesic dome is fairly straight forward. Make a triangular frame that will fit in one the the domes triangles and add hinges. CalculationsThe lengths of all things (tiles, struts, spacer) are dependent on each other. I will provide means of calculating all lengths, but because of the tiles, I cannot provide a simple formula to calculate everything. It will take some additional calculations based on the materials you will have available. For the stone and wooden ring, go to: http://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/geometry...To calculate the sizes.The stone ring requires the most thinking, because it is different for everyone. You will need to make a ring, the size of you plot. The size of this ring will largely determine the size of the dome. Choose a >14 polygon, and for 'a', enter the length of the tiles you are using. Now keep modifying n until you reach a diameter that will suit you. Remember that you also need to add the thickness of your tiles to the radius to get your outside radius. Also remember 'r' and 'R', these will need to overlap with 'r' and 'R' for the wooden ring. The wooden ring is at the base. It will have 10 elements, always, so the length is easier to calculate. insert n=10 and keep modifying a until you have the right radius. The values that need to match are 'r' and 'R'. These are the minimum and maximum radius. The radii of the stone ring need to fit within the radii of the wooden ring, where you need to be closer to the 'R' side than the 'r' side. In my case: I have tiles with a length of 0.6m. If I take 15 of those tiles, r=1.41m and R=1.44m. My struts need to fit within that, so I picked 0.9m. This gives: r=1.38m and R=1.46m. These fit within each other, and are closer to R and to r. Calculating the strut length is easier. https://simplydifferently.org/Geodesic_Dome_Notes?...Here you will find calculators. The one that is needed is the \"2V/L2 Icosahedron Dome\". You will have to modify the diameter of the dome in the calculator until the B lath length is equal to the inside length of the wooden ring. Now write down the A length and B length, so you will have it available later on. In my case, I had a diameter of 2.915m, which gave me a strut length of 0.9m. This gives me strut lengths of A=0.795m and B=0.900m. This is inside length, connector to connector.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F29/5FOT/I81GFQQR/F295FOTI81GFQQR.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Design"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "These are roughly all the materials you will need to make a 3m wide geodesic dome.

I decided that a border of concrete tiles dug into the ground would make a sound foundation.

They are a standard size here in the Netherlands and they are easy to come by. If you are not able to find the same tiles, comparable tiles will also work just as well. To make a neat circle, I made a special measuring tool. A small stake was stuck into the ground. A piece of timber with the correct length was attached to the stake in such a way that it can swivel. Every tile will be placed at the end of the timber. For each tile sits in a hole 40cm deep and 60cm wide. If you dig the hole a bit deeper, you can then fill it with leveling sand, which provides a better foundation than the clay we live on. When the tile is in place, check whether it is level in every direction and compared to the piece of timber of the tool. When you are satisfied that the tile is in the correct place, fill the space surrounding the tile back up with soil.Repeat this step, in my case, 15 times to make a full circle.

In my case, the elements are 900mm measured from the inside. It might be wise to test fit the elements before painting.Paint the bottom of each of the 10 elements with a primer. Do it properly, it will be unreachable once it is mounted and water might get to it. Allow the primer to dry and while you are waiting, proceed to the next step.A humidity barrier needs to be mounted between the concrete and the wood. Concrete absorbs water, and if no barrier was placed, the wood would rot away. I used bitumen roofing material, because we had a spare piece from making a shed, but any sturdy and watertight material should work. Cut it in 900mm long, 100mm wide strips, 10 in total.When the paint has dried, It is time to mount the elements. With my set-up, I had 2 overlaps per element on the concrete. Use a hammerdrill to drill holes the size your dowels require. Place the layer of humidity barrier on the concrete where you want the element to be, place the wooden element on top and start drilling a hole through the sandwich.

This step takes a bit of explanation, and some steps may be under-explained because this is not really an exact instructable. Some things need to be done depending on your own situation (like my door frame).Corner connectorsThe most important part of a geodesic dome is the corner connector. I tried to find something as simple as possible to make a good corner connector. I ended up with 2 plywood (1cm thick) disks, 1 of 15cm and 1 of 8cm. When stacked, these discs give an angle of about 17 degrees, perfect for a 2V dome. The struts will be connected with screws from the back, 2 per side per strut.To make the corner connectors, I found a bowl and a cup that gave me a roughly correct diameter. Using a pencil to trace the edges of the discs. Then, using a jigsaw, cut out all the discs. Finally, use a small screw to connect the small disc to the large disc, roughly in the middle. To make this dome, 25 connectors are needed. (Side note, a 2V dome actually needs 26 connectors, but the connector at the front door is not used).StrutsThe struts are up next. They need to be cut to length. The 2 rings are actually the long struts, and are 900mm. This will be the reference for the struts. 2 types are needed: The short type (type A) and the long type (type B). With a B strut length of 900mm, the A struts need to be 796mm long. This length is from centre to centre. The connector takes an additional 20mm from each side of the strut. To compensate for this, the A strut needs to be cut to 756mm and the B strut needs to be 860mm long. You will need 28 A struts and 21 B struts. (this is with the elements from the door left out). Building it upI have a schematic of the pattern, and a modified picture showing how this relates to the real greenhouse. Now comes the beauty, if you follow, this pattern, the dome basically builds itself. Don't worry about millimetres, it doesn't matter. You don't really have to measure while building, just eyeball it to make sure all struts are somewhat aligned. The struts for the door (2 A elements and 4 B elements)are left out. The will be filled in later to make the door frame.Frame for the doorThe door is filled in next. I have no exact guide for this. The main thing when adding struts to the dome is this: Triangles.Whatever you do, try to make triangles. This is what gives the dome its strength. Around the door additional bracing was added to compensate the weakness caused by the door. Then a frame was built that will hold the door. At this point the dome is at final strength.

Also subtract the width of your timber from this length to allow for overlap. Then cut 3 pieces of wood at a 30 degree angle at the required length. Then fasten all 3 pieces together to make a triangular frame. If you did well, the frame should neatly fit the hole.Put 2 hinges on one side of the frame. Take the window frame to the hole you want to place it in and use a pencil to mark where the hinges will need to be. Then take the hinge pin out and mount the 2 loose sides of the hinges to the frame. At this point you will notice that the window will not actually open. The corners of the window frame collide with the struts of the dome. Take the window frame out and at both corners on the hinge side, use a saw to cut the sides of the window frame, at a roughly 30 degree angle.

Two coats should be enough.Cut one slat  into two pieces that will fit on the edge of the window. Try to the slats sticking out as much as possible. Then, wrap the piece of foil for the window around the slats and staple it to the bottom and side of the window frame. Take a roll of clear tape and tape all the edges of the greenhouse. The staples will have left small holes, that allow water into the greenhouse. By taping them over, water will have a hard time getting in. The tiny amount that does make it through, will not cause havoc. Last step is to mount the slats over all vertical (or not horizontal) edges. Count the number of edges (both long, short and the spacer) that are steep enough so it will not catch water, and cut the slats to the same length as the struts. Paint the edges after cutting, so the wood is completely sealed. Then, using either a nailgun, hammer and nails or screw, mount the slats to the struts.After the first rain came, I quickly found that the roof over the door had a too shallow angle. Water pooled in the foil. To remedy this, another strut was mounted under the middle of the roof over the door. This prevents the foil from sagging and stops water from pooling there.

The best way to collect rain water is with a cistern that can hold thousands of gallons of water, rather than a mere 55 gallons. I recognize that not many people would like to spend their time and money on a large plastic container in their yard, which is why I am posting this \"how to\" as a compromise.

Other rain barrels use glue to hold the hose bib (spigot) in place, or they only tap the threads of the hose bib into the plastic wall of the barrel, which will certainly wear out and leak. I am using a pre-existing hole in the barrel to access the rear of the hose bib to tighten it on securely. My system does not have leaks, and if they ever develop, you could always tighten the connections or replace them. With this design I have never had a customer come back to me saying that their barrel started to leak.\u00a0\nAnother advantage to my design is that it is easily repairable if a part ever wears out or leaks. Many other rain barrels also drill holes in the barrel plugs themselves to attach a hose bib, which will come out of the bottom of the barrel. This is not a great plan either as the plug cannot be retightened and the joint is susceptible to breaking if the barrel is accidentally dropped on the hose bib.\u00a0\nMany rain barrels are made by cutting large holes in the top so that someone can access the back of the hose bib to put on a nut. The holes are commonly covered with screening material which filter's debris. In concept, this idea works, but in reality the screens clog, or rip, or they let in mosquitos, or they let in sunlight which encourages algae growth and bad smells. My barrels do not let in sun or mosquitos because it is a closed system. Debris may settle in the bottom of the barrel over time, but this will happen with any barrel. The barrel can be easily cleaned by tipping it over and spraying it out with a hose.\nFollow my instructions and I think you will be happy with the product.\u00a0", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FF4/0LX1/GJ285TFP/FF40LX1GJ285TFP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Rationale"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "For this Instructable, I will be using one blue HDPE 55 gallon barrel that has two screw plugs in the end/top. This is the most common type of barrel that I have seen and usually the cheapest to buy. Finding a barrel can be the hardest part of making a rain barrel, so I will list a few ideas, and successes that I have had:\n1. Craigslist: This is often the easiest way to find a barrel. Where I live, people commonly sell them for $10. I would not pay more than $15. If you just search for \"barrel\" you should find something. Check what was stored in them before you buy them. I have found some with liquid smoke in them that have been a real pain to deal with and they never really stop smelling. They should also not have had any toxic chemicals stored in them that could harm your plants. I would encourage you to ask if the seller is willing to trade anything for an empty barrel. Many people on Craigslist are purveyors of multiple goods or are familiar with trading for goods. It can be worth the effort to ask. You may get a free barrel or two for trading some junk that you don't need.\u00a0\n2. Local Food Distributors/Bottlers: This could be your best bet and was my method of choice. You will have to do some research and call around your city to find out if any food distributors use 55 gallon drums and if they would be able to give them to you for free or sell them at a low cost. Common uses for the drums include soda syrups, juice, soy sauce (my most common variety), grain alcohol, hops for beer, marinades, liquid smoke, etc. I googled bottling companies in my area and made many phone calls. If you are polite and present clear questions to the people who answer the phone, you may get exactly what you need. I was able to arrange to pick them up locally for free if I did not disturb the area around the facility. This arrangement worked great for me for a long time, but each scenario is different. I have head that some Pepsi/Coke bottling plants give them away, while others do not. If you are looking to make multiple rain barrels, this could be your regular supplier. Don't give up after one or two calls, I think I made about one hundred calls before setting up my particular arrangement. Seek and ye shall find.\n3. Pickles/Olives: I have met multiple rain barrel makers who get their barrels exclusively from olive or pickle distributors. . Go to your local grocery store and see if any of the pickles or olives are distributed locally and make a few phone calls to see if they have barrels. The barrels that contain olives and pickles are commonly larger and have a large screw lid, but they can be easily used to make the same type of rain barrels that I have designed.\u00a0\n4. Car wash: Many local car wash places get their soaps in 55 gallon barrels and they will sometimes give them away. I have found this approach to be more work than its worth because you will have to rinse the barrels many times to get the soap out, which can defeat the purpose of rain water harvesting. In reality, you will most likely have to rinse any barrel you find, so I guess my point is moot. This is often a viable option. I would also steer clear of the white or clear barrels common at car washes because they let sunlight in and can encourage algae growth.\n5. Vineyard: For a fancier rain barrel, you can also try calling local vineyards to find out of they have any used oak barrels for sale. With a little more effort and more upfront cost, you can have a great looking rain barrel at a fraction of the cost of a store bought oak barrel. I bought mine for $80 each, which I found to be a common price. With a little shellac the barrels can last forever.\u00a0", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F0W/4WO6/GJ285TGZ/F0W4WO6GJ285TGZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Where to Find a Barrel?"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Tools that you need include:\nSilicone Caulk\nLarge Adjustable Wrench\n1\" Forstner Bit\n4\" Hole Saw\nLong Screw Driver\nBarrel Plug Wrench (Costs about $50, can use a screw driver and hammer instead)\nDrill", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FKX/EEN9/GJ285TI9/FKXEEN9GJ285TI9.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Tools and Materials"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Materials for the barrel include:\n2\" x 3\" Flexible Downspout Adapter\n(or if you have a 4\" round downspout, you can divert it directly into the barrel.

This allows the water to leech into the soil over a given distance, rather than pooling where you don't want it.  Most french drains use holed corrugated piping or holed PVC.  I used PVC for this project.    I opted to run my french drain into a dry well at the end.  The well consists of a 55 gallon plastic drum ($35 on Craigslist) with holes drilled in it.  It sits on a bed of 3-4\" of gravel and is surrounded on its sides by about 6\" of gravel.  I purchased a toilet flange similar to this one, so the PVC pipe could securely connect to it.    The drain itself is an NDS 12-inch catch basin.   I strongly recommend this over a drain grate unless your french drain is being fed by a downspout.  By connecting your pipe to the catch basin, you're allowing water to flow into your drain without the silt or any other muck that might enter the grate.Finally, I decided to add a drain/vent for the barrel at the end.  It probably wasn't necessary, but I thought that an air vent could be good.  It would also serve as a drain if water were to collect in the yard (though it never does).  The 55 gallon drum already had a threaded 2\" hole on the top of it, so finding the proper PVC connectors was easy.  SAFETY TIP!Contact your city utilities hotline for digging BEFORE you break ground to ensure there are no gas, water, or power lines buried in your yard.

This means that generally the air over the sea is lower pressure than the air over the land, (because there is a lot of water to evaporate in the sea!)    However,  trees transpire lots of water vapor (if it is available to the tree) and in theory they could transpire more than can evaporate from the oceans.  This is because they have larger surface area and photosynthesis requires transpiration anyway.    So the air around the trees gets lighter and it rises.     This sucks in more air for outside the area.    The rising air gets colder as it rises until the dew point is reached.  The water vapor condenses, turns to clouds and n goes down.   PV= nRT is the universal gas equation.  When n goes down high in the sky,  pressure is reduced up there.  So we have a PUMP that has a stroke length that is a couple of miles high, clouds are the \"piston rings\" and the trees act like a kettle on simmer boiling up more water\"    Then it rains and most of the water vapor is removed from the air.

The Triassic was totally different,  Crazy dry interiors of continents, low oxygen levels,  (perhaps dinosaurs evolved and won out because they had superior lungs to mammal like reptiles)  but  over the millions of years of the period, it slowly got greener and nicer again and the oxygen levels rose right up  It took 7 million years or more for trees to invade the interiors again!  Maybe it was a slow priming of the biotic pump that was creating the nicer climate?  But the desert plants of the triassic would have resisted, wouldn't they? How can a little seasonal plant possibly fight against a mighty tree?  And the answer might be that they use proxy fighters. They used seasonal sacrifice  (burning up every dry summer  to clear the young  trees)  But the trees eventually seem to win over much of the earth and it gradually becomes wetter and more conducive to tree growth.    BOOM, another extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous.  The usual slow recovery occurs,  first ferns, then trees  and then something goes wrong.    Grasses evolve,  and they have a great weapon against trees. They have mixed  seasonal fire hazard  with underground growing tips.  So they are designed to burn easily and massively and recover really quickly.  Once they dry up and burn, photosynthesis in that area would stop completely for several weeks.

I found this a bit of a problem as we only have a small garden and live up in the hills on gritstone. So not a lot of clay beneath our feet, or not very pure stuff at least. After scratching of my head the only place I could think of was my mum and dads house down in the Cheshire planes. Not very local but I knew it would be good as there house is made out of Cheshire brick. Which was probably made with clay dug out of the back field which is very common round there. Surprisingly they agreed to me digging a massive whole in there garden. Mum is a keen gardener and says she suffers from clay bound soil. So digging a massive hole would loosen up the soil and be really good for her plants. Result... I think we measured took about 13 3 gallon buckets of clay when we finally hit pure stuff. which turned out just enough. Makeing test bricks is a really good idea. All clay is different (unless you buy it pure I imagine). If you mix up enough clay and sand to make a 1\" thick brick shaped lump of clay out of pure clay, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4 using more clay. The clay is made up of very fine particals and fills in the gaps between the sand. It stops it shrinking and cracking. Use a ruler and score two lines on the bricks 10\" ish apart.

The mix you choose should be hard and not crumble but not have not shrunk by more than 2% in length. After making some test bricks I came up with a ratio of about 1-1 sand and clay. I think there was a lot of sand in the clay when it came out of the ground. p.s. I just went down to the builders yard again for the sand. you need a lot. enough to mix with the clay to make a building mix and make the sand form for the dome.

So after marking out the shape of the oven on the bricks wit marker pen (so you can still see it when wet) I piled up sand in to a form. using a stick 16\" in height stuck in the middle of the form. So when you start to bury the stick you know the exact height. Kiko Denzer in his book says it is really important to get the ratio of height to door height right apparently. 16\" seams the ideal height which at a ratio of 63% gives a door height of 10\". It is all in the Kiko book. Shape the sand into a perfect dome nicely compacted down. Then layer the finished sand form with damp newspaper. This is so when emptying it you can feel where to stop digging the sand out. Now comes the clay sand mix. No straw like in a traditional cob mix which gives it strength. In an oven straw just leaves gaps and air which you don't want. You want supper compacted clay and sand for thermal mass. To make the mix you spread out a big tarp and cover it with a couple of buckets of sand and in my case a couple of bucket of clay (broken up in to little wallnut sized bits). Then tread it into to each other with your feet. If you have made pastry it is very much like rubbing the fat into the flour. You need to really thoroughly mix them together. A tarp come in really useful to do this as you can turn it all over really easily by pulling one side of the tarp to the other (the bigger the tarp the better). When you think it is all mixed in really well do it a bit more. add a bit of water till it holds together but doesn't splat when dropped from a waist height and you are ready to start building. You are going to do this a lot of times before the day is out. You want to build the first layer all in one go so you dont get and dry joints which will crack under high heat. Grab a hand full of mix and compact it down into a solid ball in your hand. build it up this way hand full by hand full (4\" thick) until you reach the top.

The carbonation is lost because the CO2 that was originally disolved into the soda escaped into the air and all you need to do to make the soda not flat is re-inject carbonation back into your soda. The process is simple with the right tools - you just need a way to apply CO2 gas with enough pressure to force the CO2 back into the soda.

The particular hot spring that my friend/sous chef and I visited is called Mickey Hot Springs in the very far south-eastern corner of Oregon near Steen's Mountain.  Key factors to keep in mind: 1.  Personal Safety- Seriously, Mama Nature is wonderful but can deal out some serious natural consequences. At this particular hot springs, you cannot enter the main pool as the water is far to hot. A somewhat standard occurrence at geothermal hot spring pools can also be an undercut edge, where the water is inches below your feet in a concentric circle expanding a few feet out from the pool. Be very careful walking and putting your full weight on ground that may not be solid and could crumble- landing you in the natural pot you were going to cook your food in. When going to remote areas, bring your essentials emergency kits, spare tires etc. 2. Food Safety- Be sure to keep your food supplies cold, especially if you happen to be an omnivore. On this trip we brought chicken meat and eggs in addition to vegetables and grains that packed in easily without much risk or inconvenience. The luxury of meat and eggs does make for a more difficult \"Geourmet\" (geothermal+gourmet) meal in that you need to keep it cold prior to cooking and cook it to a safe temperature for an appropriate amount of time. It turns out that there is a LOT of science behind the temperature that water boils, becomes steam and how hot that steam can be- which is also contingent on your elevation. I will only go into part of the overall science by giving some general tips on what to look for for food safety and temperature- please know that just like everything else you cook and eat yourself, you are ultimately responsible for the consequences. I am not an expert physicist or culinary scientist. I simply like food and being outside. IF there are any expert physicists or culinary scientists that would like to add helpful information in an appropriate way- please do so in the comments with my great appreciation!2a. Always cook chicken until the juices run clear.2b. When cooking with a new method- overcooking has less illness related consequences than under-cooking. Be patient. Chances are that someone else has tested the range of temperatures of most any hot spring or place of geothermal activity that you can find near you.

Mine has 75cm/30inches. The thickness of the thermal layer should be no less than 15cm/6inches. Mine has 20cm/8inches.\rAt some point you need to decide whether you want a chimney or not. I had the chance to use a oven with a chimney, but decided against it for my oven. The main advantage of a chimney is to take the smoke out of your face. The main disadvantage in a simple design, lots of heat will go out the chimney instead of heating up your oven. It also adds complexity to your design. If you need to add a chimney, because your fire doesn't burn cleanly, you can do it even after finishing your oven.\rThere are certain ratios between inner oven diameter, inner oven height and oven door height you need to have. The most important here, the oven opening height has to be 63% of the inner dome height. This is essential for a clean burning fire. Further, the inner dome height should be 60-75% of the inner dome diameter. With these ratios and measurements, you can determine the actual measurements for your oven. It's best if you look around for firebricks, before you decide on the size of your oven floor. You should sketch your firebrick layout on a large piece of cardboard 1:1. Then draw the inner and outer shape of your oven on it and cut it out. This will help you in the next step, the form and size of your foundation. You should place the opening of your oven away from the main wind direction. Last but not least you have to plan for a roof of some sort. If you plan to bake in bad weather, make it big enough to shelter you as well as the oven. The oven should be able to breathe, so the moisture can get out.\rI would like to strongly suggest for everyone to read the book from Kiko Denzer, \"Build your own earth oven\".  It goes much deeper into the details, he built countless different ovens and shares his knowledge. You will see references to his book throughout this instructable. Don't get me wrong here, you can build a oven with this instructable alone, but maybe you'd like to do it a little different. In this book, you will find different techniques, styles and lots of background information.\rPictures of smaller ovens made at a workshop.

A friend made a iron reinforced concrete plate for me. It is 130cm/52inches square and 6cm/2.5inches thick weighting around 350kg. This was a heavy lift for 4 persons. I originally wanted it twice as thick and even larger...\rIf you don't have a fireplace to convert , you need to make your foundation from scratch.\rDepending on where you live, you need to make it frost proof.  How deep you need to dig for frost proofing, it's best to ask a local builder. I'd dig at least 50cm/20inches in a frost free zone. Then you can build up walls up to the oven floor height. Then fill it up with gravel, and compress it by jumping. Fill the last 10cm/4inches (minimum) with sand. That's where you will put your firebricks as your oven floor. \rWhat bricks you use is up to you. If you have large stones around, use them. Kiko suggests to use \"urbanite\", that's scrapped concrete you can find at your local dump.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2B/V5GS/F5Y3TO6K/F2BV5GSF5Y3TO6K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQG/4CU4/F5Y3TO6M/FQG4CU4F5Y3TO6M.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: The Foundation"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "In my case, the size of the firebricks and the height of my ovendoor determined the remaining measurements. The size of my firebricks is 25cm/10inches square and 6cm/2.5inches thick. This is a pretty thick brick, in the smaller oven seen in step 1, the bricks were only half the thickness. The thicker the brick, the more heat it stores, but then the sand under the bricks will also store the heat.\rI layed out the bricks first to see how they arrange. Since i wanted my firebricks to \"float\" in the sandbed, i had to cut them to shape. I used a disk grinder to cut them to shape, i ground down around 6 disks. You don't have to do it this way, in the smaller ovens we just built the ovenwalls onto the firebricks.\rI sketched the layout on my concrete plate, in order to build up my foundation. If you have another foundation, you don't need to do this step, since you already have your sandbed to lay your firebricks on.\rI used Perlite as a first layer under the sandbed. This insulates the concrete plate from the hot sandbed. Otherwise the concrete plate could crack from the heat. If you like to do this, just  add it between your gravel and the sandbed.\rBe sure to compact your sandbed very well and flatten it nicely. My firebricks weren't of the exact same thickness, so i had to adjust every single one to make sure my oven floor gets flat.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FY3/D9CL/F5Y3TO8E/FY3D9CLF5Y3TO8E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG8/MH49/F5Y3TO8F/FG8MH49F5Y3TO8F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCY/E9B6/F5Y3TOA0/FCYE9B6F5Y3TOA0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5A/5MHS/F5Y3TOA7/F5A5MHSF5Y3TOA7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM3/IRVF/F5Y3TOA1/FM3IRVFF5Y3TOA1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLF/802N/F5Y3TOA2/FLF802NF5Y3TOA2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F86/K5ZR/F5Y3TOA3/F86K5ZRF5Y3TOA3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Ovenfloor"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "To define the interior shape of your oven, you have to build a sand mound. To do this, you also have to insert your oven door. The easiest way to make your door, is sawing it out of wood. It's best to use some fire resistant wood like oak. Before you close your oven for baking, you can soak it in water.\rFor my oven, i had to mount the oven door somehow. I got it from my neighbor, he has a whole lot of them around in different shapes and sizes. He's a retired blacksmith who still has his shop and is still working, but only on jobs he likes. I wanted to mount it decoupled from the hot oven, so i mounted it to the concrete plate. This was made because of the different expansion under heat. As a next step, i added a ring made of cardboard in order to have the inner walls going straight up. This way, it's easier to remove the ash and i have more usable space for baking. We added some more cardboard to stabilize the sand mound around the oven door. It is important to use \"sharp\" sand, no beach or round sand. It also needs the right moisture content, otherwise your mound will fall apart. As a further effort to stabilize the mound, we used paper with paste or goo on it. (I'm not sure about paste or goo. I mean the stuff you use on wallpaper.)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FGL/BCD7/F5Y3TO5D/FGLBCD7F5Y3TO5D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0P/WM2N/F5Y3TOCR/F0PWM2NF5Y3TOCR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1Y/GD1G/F5Y3TODB/F1YGD1GF5Y3TODB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ2/FY2C/F5Y3TOEF/FJ2FY2CF5Y3TOEF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPO/L1FP/F5Y3TOF3/FPOL1FPF5Y3TOF3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBZ/52DD/F5Y3TOGP/FBZ52DDF5Y3TOGP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Building the Sand Mound"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "This is the step, i was most afraid of. Not because how i made it, but because you may want to go on budget and dig your loam out of your backyard. Although this is perfectly possible, it's hard to tell you the right consistency. This is a tactile thing, so it's hard to describe in words.\rI used clay powder that i bought in 30kg sacks. With this stuff it's pretty easy. You only have to mix it with the same amount of sand and half the amount of cut straw by volume. Mix it well and add water until the consistency is right. If you add too much water, just add some more clay/sand mix. We used a large tarp to mix and to knead on it. To mix, roll the tarp from one side to the other, so the whole mix will be rolled and well mixed.\rThen you need to knead it well. This is very important in order to drive the air out of the mix. It's best to do this by feet, you have much more power in your legs than in your arms. We thought about mechanizing this process. Mixing could be achieved with a concrete mixer, but i don't think it would work for kneading. I think kneading could best be achieved with a bakers kneading machine, but i couldn't get my hands on one up until now.\rWe then made bricks out of this mixture and used them for building. You should always keep a 90 deg. angle to the sand form. Try to keep the width of the wall constant over the whole oven. The last piece, or the keystone wasn't made as a brick, it was pressed into place.\rNow to the diggers among us. I will tell you what Kiko Denzer writes in his book. I can't go that deep into the details as he does. First because of the time i'd need to rephrase it in my own words and second because i don't want any copyright issues coming down on me. Do yourself a favor and get this book, it's worth every buck.\rSo if you want do dig, you will first have to remove the fertile topsoil which is darker than the subsoil that is rich in clay. You could also inspect construction sites, if you see them digging a cellar or a foundation. You may ask them to dump a truckload at your place, maybe they have some sand around as well.\rThis subsoil should (mostly does) contain clay, silt sand and small gravel. Your desired building material should contain from 15 to 25% clay. This stuff is hard to dig. It is sticky and heavy around here and it doesn't crumble as a fertile topsoil would. To recognize it, the shovel should leave a shiny cut mark. If you add water, you should be able to roll it into snakes in your hands and bend it with minimal cracking. You should be able to sculpt it. You could do a test by filling a jar half with your soil, the rest with water. Then shake it well, until everything is dissolved. Stand it upright and undisturbed and watch it. In five to ten seconds, sand will settle out. After 30 or so minutes, silt will settle out. Clay takes from days to weeks to settle. So if your mixture clears in a hour or two, you can't use it, because there is no clay.\rNow that you don't know the amount of clay in your mixture, you can do a test. Take a handful of your soil, add as much sand as you think is right and work it into a firm ball. This may take some time, since you want it rather dry and compact. Let it fall to the ground from waist height. If it falls apart, you have too much sand. If it goes flat with no cracking, it's too little sand or too much clay. If it almost holds it's shape without or with little cracking, then you've got it. When you make these tests, be sure to take notes on how much sand and soil you used, so you know the mixture for \"production scale\".\rYou should make these tests because of this: clay holds water and this water will evaporate. So your building shrinks. To minimize this effect, use as little clay as possible. (15%) The drawback is a reduced \"workability\". The mixture tends to be crumbly and needs lots of kneading. I used more clay for my mixture, i knew that some cracks will show up anyway, so using a fatter mixture made for easier handling. You have to decide this for yourself. \rIn the production mixture, you also have to add some straw, cut up to 2.5 to 5cm or 1 to 2 inch pieces. I added half the amount of the sand by volume. (two buckets of sand, one bucket of cut straw) I have to admit, i bought the straw cut up. If you don't want to cut it manually, try a wood chipper.\rIt will be pretty hard to mix the soil with sand, water and straw. It's best if you invite your buddies over to help you. Your invitation should include some beers and one or two pizza happenings later on. We were only two, my brew-buddy and me. Sometimes it was a bit depressing, when the work didn't seem to have a end. We were asked to help someone build his oven, after he saw mine. He wanted to pay us, but i told him that it's more important to have a couple of helping hands or even better feet.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FT4/5F5R/F5Y3TOIM/FT45F5RF5Y3TOIM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMR/XLPD/F5Y3TOIN/FMRXLPDF5Y3TOIN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS3/3MFE/F5Y3TOIU/FS33MFEF5Y3TOIU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3G/4TRV/F5Y3TOIW/F3G4TRVF5Y3TOIW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKT/KPMZ/F5Y3TOJ1/FKTKPMZF5Y3TOJ1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVD/3Y8Z/F5Y3TOJE/FVD3Y8ZF5Y3TOJE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8I/32WB/F5Y3TOJG/F8I32WBF5Y3TOJG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHL/IJM9/F5Y3TOJR/FHLIJM9F5Y3TOJR.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Building the Oven / Making the Building Material"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "If you are building with a rather dry mixture, you can remove the sand form right after you finished building.

So we removed the sand to dry it out from the inside as well. To speed up the process i burned large candles inside my oven. After another week, i started my first fire. Start it small, and do it daily for a week or so. After this, my oven was dry and i tried my first bread.

I planned my insulation from the beginning, but i wanted to see how it works without. After applying 8cm/3.5inches of insulation made of Perlite and clay, the outside temperature dropped by half, keeping the heat much longer. You can use different materials for insulation, my choice was a foamed mineral. You could use Vermiculite or pumice, but straw or coarse sawdust from a chainsaw would also work. Maybe you need to make a thicker layer to achieve the same insulating effect. I used a sturdy paint mixer in a electric drill to mix clay, Perlite and water. As you can see, it cracked after drying. We used a silicone cartridge, filled with rather thin clay to fill the cracks. We further made a temporary roof with the tarp we used for mixing and kneading the mud mix. The final roof will be made of fiber concrete(ethernit), but it's up to you what you use. Depending on the distance from your oven opening, it needs to be heat resistant. It worked with the tarp and pine wood without melting or charring, but i will use oak where it gets hot.We will add a thin layer of clay plaster 1cm/0.5inch when we remove the temporary roof.

Normal, l'eau ne br\u00fble pas.Pire, l'eau a une caract\u00e9ristique bien sp\u00e9ciale, elle absorbe toute l'\u00e9nergie disponible alentour pour se vaporiser ; c'est le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne de chaleur latente.Comme chacun sait, l'eau bout (s'\u00e9vapore et se transforme en vapeur) \u00e0 100\u00b0 et toute l'\u00e9nergie disponible sera absorb\u00e9e jusqu'\u00e0 ce que toute l'eau soit vaporis\u00e9e. Mais 100\u00b0, c'est insuffisant pour maintenir la r\u00e9action de gaz\u00e9ification du bois. Le bois se gaz\u00e9ifie \u00e0 250\u00b0. Donc, une biomasse s\u00e8che est un imp\u00e9ratif.Les granul\u00e9s de bois utilis\u00e9s pour le chauffage ont un taux d'humidit\u00e9 optimal inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 5 %.Le bois vert se trouve lui \u00e0 plus de 40 %.La limite \u00e0 ne pas d\u00e9passer est de 15 % d'humidit\u00e9.10 % est une bonne moyenne ; \u00e7a correspond \u00e0 de petites branches s\u00e8ches et cassantes.Le bois de cagettes est toujours inf\u00e9rieur tout comme les coques de noix ou de pistaches.Les petites pommes de pins rondes sont aussi de bons combustibles.Attention \u00e0 la granulom\u00e9trie :Les aiguilles de pin sont le minimum en termes de granulom\u00e9trie. Elles laissent passer suffisamment d'air primaire ; mais on ne peut envisager de faire fonctionner l'appareil avec de la sciure, du marc de caf\u00e9 ou du son de bl\u00e9 par exemple, c'est trop fin.A l'inverse, des branchages ou des bouts de cagettes trop gros risquent de ne pas permettre une combustion assez longue du fait de la plus grande circulation d'air primaire et du peu de combustible pr\u00e9sent en raison des grands espaces vides.Le pouvoir calorifique :En moyenne, le PCI (pouvoir calorifique) des diff\u00e9rentes biomasses est assez proche.Il est li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'humidit\u00e9 (voir plus haut) et \u00e0 la densit\u00e9 de la mati\u00e8re.Les granul\u00e9s de bois sont peu \u00e9cologiques ; mais du fait de leur densit\u00e9, ils poss\u00e8dent le plus grand pouvoir calorifique.La coque de noix de coco (rare sous nos latitudes) est un excellent combustible \u00e9galement.Ainsi, la combustion sera plus ou moins longue \u00e0 volume \u00e9gal selon qu'on utilise de la cagette ou des copeaux de ch\u00eane.Allumage :Comme pour l'allumette, le d\u00e9marrage de la r\u00e9action demande un apport d'\u00e9nergie ext\u00e9rieur suffisamment long.Dans le cas d'une utilisation avec des copeaux de rabotage de sapin, un petit bout de papier suffit.  Pour les granul\u00e9s de bois, il faudra utiliser un starter.L'alcool en gel que l'on trouve dans le commerce fonctionne \u00e0 coup s\u00fbr mais est co\u00fbteux et peu vertueux.L'huile v\u00e9g\u00e9tale est une bonne alternative surtout si elle est recycl\u00e9e (huile de friture, huile des boites de sardine \u2026).Avec l'huile, il faut envisager d'imbiber au pr\u00e9alable un peu de combustible pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 cet effet puis d'allumer le tout avec un bout de papier.Attention, le papier journal pourrait \u00eatre un bon starter mais les cendres qu'il produit ont tendance \u00e0 boucher l'appareil et \u00e0 l'\u00e9touffer.Chargement :Selon la biomasse utilis\u00e9e et la dur\u00e9e de combustion souhait\u00e9e, on peut charger l'appareil de 25 \u00e0 75 % de la hauteur totale du pot de combustion.Pas moins, sinon la dur\u00e9e de combustion est vraiment trop r\u00e9duite, et pas plus, sinon on obture les arriv\u00e9es d'air secondaire et alors, attention \u00e0 la fum\u00e9e \u2026Apr\u00e8s quelques essais, on parvient vite \u00e0 trouver les r\u00e9glages.A titre indicatif :150 gr de bois de cagettes ou de brindilles s\u00e8ches donnent environ 20 minutes de flamme utiles200 gr de pommes de pins donnent environ 40 minutes de flamme utile200 gr de coques de noix ou de pistaches donnent environ 50 minutes de flamme utile300 gr de granul\u00e9s de bois (pellets) donnent environ 1h20 de flamme utileFonctionnement :Dans un premier temps, se forme le front de pyrolyse qui descendra progressivement.La gaz\u00e9ification d\u00e9marre et au bout de quelques minutes se forme le bouclier de flammes de la postcombustion.C'est le moment de poser la casserole.Il n'est pas possible de recharger l'appareil durant son fonctionnement.La combustion peut durer jusqu'\u00e0 une heure, voire plus.Attention \u00e0 la stabilit\u00e9 et \u00e0 l'environnement, le risque de br\u00fblure ou de s'\u00e9bouillanter avec l'eau par exemple est r\u00e9el et doit \u00eatre pris en compte.L'appareil, surtout en fin de cycle, chauffe vers le bas, il faut imp\u00e9rativement le poser sur un support qui ne craint pas la chaleur.Extinction :Une fois toute la partie lignine/h\u00e9micellulose gaz\u00e9ifi\u00e9e, il reste un charbon dont la combustion peut se poursuivre durant encore une heure.On peut utiliser cette \u00e9nergie pour maintenir le plat ou l'eau au chaud, mais la production d'\u00e9nergie ne suffit plus \u00e0 cuisiner.Pour \u00e9teindre le charbon, si on se r\u00e9f\u00e8re au triangle du feu, soit on le prive d'air en le mettant dans une boite (de conserve) que l'on ferme, soit on l'asperge d'eau.Le charbon \u00e9teint par \u00e9touffement va rester chaud longtemps et peut reprendre sa combustion si on ouvre la boite. Cette m\u00e9thode est \u00e0 privil\u00e9gier si on dispose de temps et si on souhaite utiliser le charbon ult\u00e9rieurement comme combustible.Le charbon \u00e9teint avec de l'eau est partiellement activ\u00e9 et il peut \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 pour filtrer de l'eau, comme ingr\u00e9dient de peinture ou \u00eatre compost\u00e9 avec des v\u00e9g\u00e9taux.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQW/0B59/J0IEJ3OT/FQW0B59J0IEJ3OT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7T/SQ9B/J0IEIVTQ/F7TSQ9BJ0IEIVTQ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 17: Utilisation"}], "channel": "Fire"}, {"category": "outside", "description": "This is the simplest project you can do.

Fresh baked bread!  Roasted chicken and vegetables!  Pies!  Soups!  Stews!  Slightly charred oven mitts!  That awesome smoky smell to your clothes!   Sound good?  You can have all this in your very own backyard, and it can be built in a few days (mostly waiting time) with materials that are very easily sourced, possibly all from your own backyard.SAFETY:   Please use the normal precautions when working with any tools, and especially after you build the oven and start lighting fires.  Fire is hot.  Make sure you aren't near anything that is a fire hazard, etc. The short story:  This instructable will show you how to build your very own MINI earth oven so you can enjoy cooking and baking small items in your own backyard.  Also known as a cob oven, clay oven, mud oven, or horno (and more!), a wood fire is burned inside of the earth oven, removed after it  is down to coals, and all that precious heat from the fire is retained  in the clay walls and in your brick hearth, slowly radiating back out  into the oven, cooking/baking your food.  The temperatures start around  500-600 degrees F, and slowly come down over a long period of time,  usually around 24-36 hours in total.  It is during this time that you  can cook/bake many different foods, starting with higher-temperature  foods like pizza and bread, and ending with lower-temperature cooked  foods like stews or baked goods.  Even when your oven is down to 200  degrees F, it's nice to put some wood in the oven to help further dry it  out for your next firing.The longer story:  About 7 years ago, I built a full size earth oven (22.5\" cooking floor diameter) that still stands today.  I was inspired by and took instruction from Kiko Denzer's book 'Build Your Own Earth Oven'.  I built it all on my own over a period of 1-2 weeks with all locally-sourced materials and we've enjoyed countless evenings full of wood-fired pizza, fresh bread with a delicious golden crust and chewy interior, free-form blueberry pies, roasted chicken, roasted veggies, and they all come with a certain earthy scent that is almost sweet, it's difficult to describe, but you know it when you taste it and it's FANTASTIC!  As a bonus, after cooking, it's so nice to lean back onto the outside curve of the hot oven and get a hot rock massage with the heat radiating out through your back.  :)I have two young children who love great food, and they both have a certain fascination with watching their dad (me!) fire up our earth oven, tending the fire, pulling hot coals out (yes,they are safely at a distance), putting the door on and letting the oven rest for 20 minutes, then popping in a pizza and only a short TWO MINUTES later seeing it come out of the oven fully cooked, cheese bubbling and golden brown!  The full size oven takes 2 hours of fire to get up to pizza-cooking temperatures.  From the time I light the fire to the time lunch or dinner gets on the table is always right around 3 hours.  Kids can get impatient, and it also seems like a lot of time, energy, and resources to fire up the big oven if we just want to cook or bake something small.Voila!  Our MINI-earth oven idea was born, as I remembered that in Kiko's book he does feature a 'muffin oven'.  It's a very small earth oven built around a few bricks, but has no insulation whatsoever, and as a result, loses heat quickly.  I decided to build this 'muffin oven', but add in the features of our bigger oven which includes a nice-looking base, a layer of insulation, a second layer of \"mud\", and a finish/plaster layer.  My kids and I will cook mini pizzas, muffins and cupcakes (full size), small breads, mini pies, and more!  It won't take nearly as much time to fire it up and heat it, and it will retain heat for enough time to cook a few batches.  Get your kids to help you build and cook in it!  Get your friends to come over and pitch in!   You can absolutely build this yourself but having help is better (and more  fun!).  My kids and I are very close, and doing this project together bonded us even closer in a whole new way, one I could never imagine.

It is very comprehensive (yet simple!) and covers every facet of building an oven with earth in such wonderful detail, especially if you plan on building a full-size oven.   It also instructs on how to make your own sourdough bread!  Bonus!

Dig down into your soil about a FOOT down or more.  That's where clay is.  It's not the growing soil in the top 6 inches.  Below that is usually silt.  Clay almost has a \"shine\" to it.  Where I live, we have so many rocks and boulders to dig through that it isn't worth trying to get down to the clay.  Luckily, we live in the mountains and I found a few nice veins of clay during a rainstorm on my hike.  That was the good news.  The bad news is that I had to carry all that clay back to my car.  I made many, MANY trips, digging up the clay and putting it into buckets and backpacks.  From all the research I've done on other people building these ovens, most have clay in their own backyards, or close by on a construction site or where road construction is being done.  Other places you might find it are at old quarries, riverbanks, ponds, or ask a friendly neighbor if they have clay on their land that you can have.  If after all that you can't find any, you can buy pure \"fireclay\" which comes dry and powdered from your local building supplier.Sand - you want coarse sand, not beach sand.  Straw - not hay.Rocks - As I wrote, we have an abundance of rocks so I used that as the base for this oven.  For our large oven, we used broken up pieces of driveway that someone was throwing away.  You can use whatever you'd like: bricks, rocks, old concrete, etc.  Since this is a very small oven, I went with rocks.  As Forrest Gump said, \"Sometimes I guess there just aren't enough rocks.\"....... unless you're in my backyard.Firebrick - I've heard of using regular brick, but to be safe, choose firebrick.  It's made specifically for use in fireplaces and stoves.  You can get them from most suppliers of masonry materials.  I bought mine here: http://www.absupply.com/index.phpTarp - just a standard blue or green 6' x 8' tarp.  You'll mix your \"mud\" on this using your feet!Small bottles - if you don't have any, you can use garden perlite from your local gardening center.  This works fine.  I like using the bottles that are just sitting in our pantry cabinet.  They finally have a use.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5Q/98VL/J2UPM7XR/F5Q98VLJ2UPM7XR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ7/71GY/J2UPL903/FQ771GYJ2UPL903.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8M/GX2J/J2UPL8TZ/F8MGX2JJ2UPL8TZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Gather Your Materials and Tools"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Find your spot where you want your mini earth oven to be.  It's small so it can fit pretty much anywhere.  I put ours on the wide ledge of a wall.I had a large 16\" x 16\" paving stone that wasn't being used so I put that on the wall, supporting it with another paving stone underneath it (see picture).Your foundation has to support the weight of the oven, protect against ground moisture, be rigid and strong, and at the height you want it.  For obvious reasons, don't use a plastic foundation, or even a wood foundation.  You're working with fire after it's built and heat can melt or burn these materials.After deciding on your foundation, put down a thin layer of sand.  This helps stabilize your first layer of rock.  Start laying down your first ring of rock or other chosen material until you have a full circle.  With rocks, you have to play with the different shapes and sizes.  I tried to use mostly flat rocks but that wasn't always possible, so you have to 'puzzle' it together until it is sturdy.  Then lay your next ring of rocks (or chosen material) \"one over two\".  Each rock in your second ring should not be right on top of another rock.  It should be on top of TWO rocks.  This helps stabilize your base as you build it up.  Think of a brick wall and how each row is laid on top of each other.  I've included a photo of a rock wall to give you an idea.  You can build up 2 or 3 or 4 rows of rock, your choice.  I did 3.

You can use more rocks OR get down and dirty and start making some \"mud\".  This earth oven is made of something referred to as \"cob\".  Cob is the mixture of clay, sand, water, and straw.  Take your clay, and if it's dry, soak it overnight, and it will become soft.  Fill a bucket half full of water, add dry clay to it until it's full, and wait until it's soft.  Pour off any excess water before using it.  TIP:  Since you'll be mixing this with your feet, you'll water to make sure the clay is free from rocks and pebbles.   There might even be nails or glass.  TRUST ME, IT HURTS IF YOU STEP ON ONE.  You can screen your clay through a wooden frame lined with heavy wire cloth (hardware cloth), usually 1/4\" or 1/2\" is enough to screen out the pebbles and rocks.  If you want to skip this step, I recommend mixing up the cob while wearing old shoes/boots.  Save your feet!After getting your clay ready, it's time to lay out your tarp on flat ground.  Clear the ground as best you can of pebbles and stones.  Even if they aren't in your clay, you'll still feel them on your feet if they are under your tarp.  Here is the basic recipe for making cob:One part clay Two to four parts coarse or sharp sand Water StrawYou can skip the straw at this point if you want, but you'll be adding it later for the outer part of the oven.  I saved a step and just mixed the straw in too.  It won't hurt a bit and actually makes everything that much stronger.For this project, I used ONE 5-gallon bucket of clay, TWO 5-gallon buckets of sand, about TWO-THIRDS of a 5-gallon bucket of straw, and enough water to mix it together without it being too wet or too dry.  More on that in a bit.Back to your tarp!Pour your sand in a circle in the center of the tarp, like a donut.  Put your clay in the middle, add a little water if you need to, and start a'steppin'!  Get your feet in there, pull some sand into the clay, step on it, twist in it, do your 'cob dance'.  You'll quickly get a feel as to whether you need more water or not.  If you put in too much, not to worry, you can always let the mixture dry out a bit over the course of a day or two.  This is where I got my kids to join in, and we got all nice and muddy, laughing, playing, singing, and it helps get their energy out!  Keep working all the sand into the clay.  At times, you can pull the sides of the tarp towards yourself which helps pull some of the mud over onto itself.  Keep it all on the tarp!  Then start stepping on it again.  You want a nice homogeneous mix.  It's easier to do this first before adding the straw.  Once you have a nice mix, put in your straw and start your footwork again until the straw is nicely mixed in.  There you have it........COB!!  This is what your earth oven is made of!  Grab a handful of your mixture and start kneading it with your hands.  Squeeze it and squish it 20-30 times.  Make a firm ball with it, and test it.  How?  Drop it onto the ground. If it crumbles, it either needs more mixing, more water, or more clay.  If it's 'splooshes' onto the ground, it's too wet.  If the ball maintains most of its shape, flattening only on the bottom of the ball, it's just right, Goldilocks!Once you have the right mix, start making MANY balls.  You will form a ring of cob on top of your foundation rocks.  (see pictures)  You will want to make the ring high enough to hold your insulation mix (next step) and your bottles (tipped on their side).  You can also use some of the cob mixture as mortar to secure any wobbly rocks in your foundation.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFD/S5Z4/J2UPL4TZ/FFDS5Z4J2UPL4TZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F84/F7W1/J2UPL48W/F84F7W1J2UPL48W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F33/2UU2/J2UPL3Z2/F332UU2J2UPL3Z2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR5/2F8S/J2UPKRES/FR52F8SJ2UPKRES.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDL/XJJ1/J2UPKRK1/FDLXJJ1J2UPKRK1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJS/97PD/J2UPL5R0/FJS97PDJ2UPL5R0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLM/UD5N/J2UPKRBZ/FLMUD5NJ2UPKRBZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F82/5T2S/J2UPL5ZA/F825T2SJ2UPL5ZA.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Make Rings to Hold the Subfloor Insulation"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Cooking and baking require heat, oh precious heat, but if we lose that heat, your culinary treats won't turn out well.  How do we preserve that heat?  INSULATION!  Before building the actual oven, we will want to insulate below the floor of the oven to help keep all the precious heat from being sucked out of  the hot firebricks down into the cool gravel, rocks, and foundation below.  This is where this project differs from the \"muffin oven\" listed in Kiko's book.  That one doesn't have any insulation, and as a result, heat is lost quickly.  We will clay, water, bedding material (pine shavings), and little glass bottles.Mix together some clay and water in a bucket or other vessel until it becomes a heavy cream consistency.  This is called 'clay slip'.  If you have dry clay, break it up until it is the texture of coarse gravel, put it into a bucket that is 1/3 full of water.  Pour off any excess water after putting the clay in.  Let it soak overnight.  The next day, stir and stir and you should have a nice heavy cream like consistency ............. clay slip!  Mix handfuls of bedding with just enough clay slip to make a firm dough.  You should be able to pack the 'dough' into a ball.  If you use too much clay slip it will drip.  If you use too little clay slip, it will crumble.  Put a 1\" layer of your insulation mixture on top of your gravel.  Then lay your bottles down and nestle them gently into the insulation mixture (you are not burying them).  Leave a 1/2\"-1\" gap in between bottles.  Then fill in those gaps and cover the bottles with more insulation mix.  You should just be able to see the top side of the bottles (see pictures).You can either let that dry, or continue.  The next insulation step is to put a layer of cob (EARTH/MUD/CLAY MIX) on top of the insulation mix you just covered the bottles with.  Since you've already made your cob, it's time to make more cob balls and make an earth floor with it.  (see pictures)  Make plenty of balls and start putting them on top of the bottle/insulation mix.  The cob should be soft enough to work all the balls together so it ends up as one uniform floor piece.  (see the pictures)You can let this dry, or continue.  It's a good time for a little break, even a day or two if you want.

Your oven is about to really start to take shape, so keep at it!  It's time to lay down your firebrick.  This is what you'll be cooking on so we want to make sure your bricks are even, flat, and clean (if using used bricks).  Your cob sub floor should be nice and flat, and quite firm, well on its way to being dry.  Smooth out a very shallow layer of sand on the sub floor and do a practice run of where you'll lay your bricks.  Take a look at your oven so far from the top down and try to center your bricks.  You'll also want to see if the tongue is where you want it (this is the part of the bricks that will be outside of your oven door. (see picture)Once you're satisfied, mark either a center point or even a corner where you will lay your bricks, remove the bricks and then carefully reset the first one back to your marked point.  Take your next brick and starting about an inch above the surface of your first brick, gently \"kiss\" the long side of the brick you're holding and slide it down the long side of the first brick that is already on the oven floor. It should fit nice and snug against the first brick with no gaps.  Take the handle end of a hammeror similar tool and tap tap tap the brick down firm.  Once the brick is set, don't touch it!  You don't want sand in between the bricks.  I ended up with a slight gap in between my two front bricks (sort of like David Letterman) because of the way the bricks were cut, and I ended up filling the gap with some cob material.  If yours don't sit flush, take them off and redo them.  It's quick and easy and in the long run, very worth it.Once done, take a string and tie it to a pencil close to the writing side, not the eraser.  You will be holding the other end of the string down at the center of your SUB FLOOR and drawing a perfect circle on the bricks so that the sides of the circle \"kiss\" the edges of the bricks.  (see picture)This is where you will be building your sand mound (next step) and eventually will be your oven cavity where you'll build your fire and cook your fine food!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZQ/EZD7/J2UPKTHF/FZQEZD7J2UPKTHF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUC/3QB2/J2UPKU4H/FUC3QB2J2UPKU4H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8A/CSXV/J2UPKUIG/F8ACSXVJ2UPKUIG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW7/924N/J2UPKV2J/FW7924NJ2UPKV2J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS4/0AO7/J2UPKVNA/FS40AO7J2UPKVNA.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: The Hearth! "}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Now it gets super fun!  It's time to make the inside of your oven.  How?  You build a mound out of sand that will be built upon with your cob material, and later remove the sand leaving a beautifully curvy dome inside.  This part is critical:  You'll want to have enough time to make your sand dome AND cover it with the first layer of cob material all in one go.  If you don't finish the layer of cob and have to start on it again at a later time, you end up with a 'cold joint' that makes for easy cracking and damage when you light up your oven.  With a small oven like this, it's pretty easy to get it done in a few hours (if by yourself).  When I made my large oven, I worked from 8am until 1am to get it done (again, by myself) and it was NOT fun.  I was almost crying by the end.  (So make a note that if you decide to make a larger oven, get your family and/or friends to help!)Get your sand and get it damp, like you're at the beach building a sandcastle.  If it's too wet, it will slump.  Too dry, it'll fall apart on itself.  Just like coloring back in kindergarten, stay inside the lines of your circle!  Start to build up until you have a dome shape.  The sides of your dome should go straight up vertically from the bricks for about 2-3 inches before it starts to arc inward.  Kiko's book put it best:  \"Imagine a hemisphere sitting on a 2-3 inch disk\".  (see picture for an example.Keep the edge of your circle very defined (stay inside the lines!).  I built my sand dome up to a height of 9\".  Hold a straight stick across the top of the dome and measure down to the bricks.  Your dome should be even, solid, and hard-packed.  To make it easy to remove the sand later, cover your dome with wet newspaper, either in a big sheet, or think strips if the big sheet is tough to work with.  Smooth the paper down flat so any edges won't get caught in your cob and make a crack later.  (see pics)NO REST YET!It's time to start building your cob around your dome.  This is it!  You're about to make your oven!  Take handfuls of your cob, make them into balls (squeezing and kneading) and start pressing handfuls of it around the base of your sand dome.  This is what will be holding your bricks in place AND will form the shell of your oven.  IMPORTANT:  Press the cob mixture down onto itself and NOT IN towards the sand dome.  If you do, it will damage your sand dome and that will be that.  Always work each next handful of cob onto itself, pressing down, using one hand as a guide to keep the thickness even, and the other hand to press down.Keep going until you've covered the entire sand dome.  Look at it.  Are there flat spots?  Low spots?  Hills and valleys?  You can use a small flat board to blend all the irregular spots together until it's one nice looking smooth shape, sort of like an egg. (I neglected to do this, and while I was able to fix it later, it wasn't easy, so do it right the first time).Once done, take that same board (a 2 x 4 works great) and whack the clay dome firmly to help consolidate all of the material.  It should sound solid.  If it's slumping or sticks to your board, it's too wet.  Let it dry a bit a come back later to try again.CONGRATULATIONS!  The hardest part (in my opinion) is over!  Well done!  Go rest!

It's time to cut a doorway and remove your sand.  Exciting!  Ok, so for a normal size oven, the door height should ALWAYS be 63% of the INTERIOR height (the height of your sand dome).  So for mine with a sand dome height of 9\", the height of my doorway should be 9 x .63 which equals 5.67\".  The width is typically half of your oven floor width (which in this case is the width of one full brick or 9\"), so my door width should be 4.5\".  Kiko recommended in his book to make the doorway height about 2/3 as high as the oven (67%) and nearly as wide as the brick floor.    Based on my 9\" dome height, this would make the door height at 6\" and the width of the door at 9\" (my brick floor width).  I didn't listen to him and made the door height 5\" and the door width also 5\".  It was my instinct that I would lose too much heat with a wider door.I drew a rough door shape with a knife, or you can use the edge of a spoon or a stick.  Start cutting out your door and make sure you cut down at an angle into the cob material,  Pretend you're cutting the top off a pumpkin for Halloween.  If you cut straight in, the door will fall into the oven.  See the angle of my knife in the picture?  That's what you want.   This makes the INSIDE of the cut lower than the OUTSIDE of the cut. IMPORTANT:  Your door height should be measured from the LOW POINT (the inside cut).Once done, pull your cut piece off and what do you see?  Your newspaper and sand!  Hello old friends!I measured the door height from the inside cut and was too low, so I cut some more to make the height just the way I wanted it.

I used a spoon at the beginning near the middle of the oven and even let my kids have a go at it (see videos), but always switch to using my hands as I reach the edges so I can feel for the newspaper.  It's very satisfying to pull a piece of the newspaper off, revealing the inside of your dome.  I used a flashlight to see inside as I get near the end so I can really tell what I'm doing.  It's dark in there!  If you have some rough or loose spots inside (I sure did!), don't worry.  Take the back of a spoon and smooth, polish, and compact it.  It's a good time to take a break, and also fun to say hello to your oven interior right up at the mouth of your doorway.  The echo is quite pleasing!  (or I'm very easily amused)You know what?  You have a basic oven!  Once the oven completely dries out, you can start baking and cooking.It won't hold heat for very long, but you could use it.This is where Kiko's book stopped for the 'muffin oven' but I continued with insulation.

It's just for aesthetics BUT is an EXCELLENT way to get a tight-fitting door.  Yes, you cut the doorway, but you still need an actual door!  You could use what you cut out but it doesn't always fit well, nor does it last very long if it's crumbling.  Take a piece of paper and trace over the door opening, put the paper against a piece of wood (I used redwood since it's somewhat impervious to heat) and cut out a door.  Smooth out the edges with sandpaper, put some type of handle on the front (I used a plain ol' stick with a couple of nails!), and then put it up against the front of your oven.  Do not fret if it doesn't fit, because you're going to use your cob mix to build an arch up and around the doorway and your DOOR.  This insures that your door will fit perfectly!

You've arrived and have completed making your very own earth oven!  Well done!  Now it's time to enjoy the spoils!  I won't go into fire-making here, but will offer a few tips:Start your fire on the outer part of your brick tongue, and as it builds, slowly push it further back into the center of your oven.  This may take a while.  And please use a tool or stick or something to push the fire back, not your hands.   I fired mine up for the first time before EVERYTHING had a chance to dry out and it took close to an hour to get the interior hot enough for the fire to be pushed into it.  Be patient.  Get to know your fire.  More importantly, get to know your oven!  This takes time and practice, and is well worth it!   After getting your fire into the center of your oven, you will need to keep feeding it with small pieces of wood because it's such a small oven.  Have your wood ready.   Once your fire has been burning for a good hour and has burned down to coals (you've decided to stop feeding it wood), you will rake the coals out using some sort of tool like a mini hoe or rake.  I used a stick with a curved end and it worked great.  Make sure you rake the coals onto something safe.  I had a lot of sand underneath the oven which worked great.  You can rake it into a bucket or other metal container, just be aware of HOT COALS coming out of the oven towards you.   You'll still have ash on the oven floor.  You'll want to have a stick with a wringed out (wrung?) cotton rag attached to the end of it, perhaps with a nail through it.  Essentially you want something like a mini-mop to clean off the oven floor.  This takes just a few sweeps of the oven floor. Place your oven door on and let the oven \"soak\" for a few minutes.  This will help even out the temperature of your oven floor.  For such a small floor, it may not even be necessary.   I purchased a laser temperature gun to use with my large oven, and came up with a temperature of around 250 degrees F, lower than I would have liked, BUT, the oven is definitely still wet in parts, so I'll try again in a few days after letting it dry out more.  You can try cooking muffins, cupcakes, small breads, pies, pizzas and more!  Experiment!  Learn!  And yes, you cook right on the oven floor!!!BAKE!  COOK!  EAT!  SHARE!

They consist of two terra cotta pots, one nested inside the other, with the gap between them filled with wet sand. The sand serves as a thermal mass that helps keep the pot cold once it has cooled down, and acts as a wick to spread the moisture up the walls of the pot. When placed in a shaded, breezy location, the evaporation of water off the outer surface chills the pot. If you have a good breeze, or a fan powered by a solar panel blowing the pot, the pot can get quite cold. Imagine that chill you get when you step out of a pool when the wind is blowing. Now imagine that wet wind chill going on all day. That's what the pot feels with a constant breeze. Unless the air is very dry and the pot is exposed to a constant breeze, they generally do not become as cold as a refrigerator, but they will keep vegetables fresh for a couple of weeks. If you do have cool dry air and a constant stiff breeze, the interior of a zeer pot can chill down to around 40\u02daF.Think of it as an open-cycle refrigerator. Conventional refrigerators evaporate a refrigerant in a closed circuit to absorb heat from their interiors, then compress the refrigerant vapor in the coils in back to condense it and to expel heat. The zeer pot simply uses water as its refrigerant, and leaves the condensation to nature.Zeer pots were re-discovered and popularized in the early 2000s by the Nigerian teacher Mohammed Bah Abba. By manufacturing and mass distributing zeer pots to the poor, he was able to bring refrigeration to tens of thousands of impoverished farmers and home makers, enabling them to extend the usable life of their produce from days to weeks. For his efforts Bah Abba was awarded the Rolex Award for bringing life-changing technology to people in need.In the under-developed parts of Africa and the Middle East, zeer pots use custom made pots prepared by local potters. Here in the developed world, we need to settle for pre-made pots from the hardware store. There are some drawbacks, but also some advantages afforded by these limitations, as you will see.What makes this zeer pot practical?  There are other zeer pot instructables out there, but this one is optimized for practicality. If the capacity is too small, the cooling capacity too low, or if it an eyesore or is annoying to use nobody would want to use it. This zeer pot uses a large glass pot lid, has an interior basket divider, and sits on a rolling cart. It even has a layer of decorative pebbles over the sand to make it look pretty. The terra cotta pot legs hold the pot off the rolling cart with enough clearance to let the bottom surface contribute to evaporation; this adds about 10%-15% more evaporative surface. The inner pot is bolted down so that it doesn't float up when you charge the pot with water. Nearly everything I used in this project was purchased at a hardware store, and it can be made in a few hours, plus a day to let the sealants cure.I will be building a zeer pot array for A Place for Sustainable Living in Oakland (California) based on this design. The goal is to use an array of zeer pots to displace the use of at least one of their refrigerators. The design shown here is the outcome of my experimentation with making zeer pots for them.(Be sure to read all the notes to all of the photos. Many important details are listed there.)Parts list with prices Prices are rounded to the nearest dollar. (I must admit, this is by no means the inexpensive original African zeer pot, which cost $2 to make. You're going to spend well over a hundred dollars on this design. This one is for people are intentionally going out of their way to go off grid or to pursue sustainable options.)Items are mostly from Orchard Supply Hardware (Berkeley, CA).

(However, a friend of mine who used a zeer pot to cool water in a humid part of Africa tells me that even with the humidity, it worked surprisingly well, so this is not definitive.)Note: direct sunlight will cancel out all cooling effectsOn the day I was doing the zeer pot seminar at the Place for Sustainable Living, we accidentally left one in direct sunlight. The amount of heat imparted by the sun totally overwhelmed the evaporative cooling effect. The cooling is supposed to come strictly from wind-induced evaporation, not from evaporation due to sun exposure. Sun exposure causes evaporation by imparting heat; wind exposure causes evaporation by lifting away water molecules, which carries away heat proportional to the heat it takes to evaporate the quantity of water carried away. If you do build a zeer pot, make sure you keep it in the shade for best effect.Note: outer pot must be unglazed clay or terra cottaAt the hardware store, I saw a lot of fake terra cotta pots made of orange plastic. These are not usable for the outer pot of the zeer pot; the zeer pot cools by wind evaporating water that has been wicked through the outer surface. Plastic fake terra cotta is not porous, and will not work as an evaporative surface. Glazed terra cotta pots also don't work for the outer pot. The inner pot doesn't necessarily have to be made of unglazed terra cotta, but the outer pot must be unglazed because glazed pots won't wick moisture to the outer surface for evaporation.Note: many medium sized zeer pots work better than one giant zeer potThe ability of a zeer pot to cool its content depends on the surface area to volume ratio. As you make the zeer pot larger, the volume will increases proportional to the cube of the linear dimensions, but the surface area only increases proportional to the square of the linear dimensions. Because the volume increases much faster than the surface area, one huge zeer pot will actually perform much worse than several smaller zeer pots. The size of the zeer pot in this instructable is about as large as you can make them while having a practical rate of cooling. You can always make them smaller; making them larger is not likely to give you reasonable performance. If you are serious about going off-grid, you would do better to make several zeer pots of this size than to make one huge zeer pot.

The terra cotta pots that we have access to have holes in the bottom for drainage; these need to be plugged so sand and water don't drain out the outer pot, nor into the inner pot. I have found that it is insufficient to merely plug the holes; zeer pots also have another annoying problem where the inner pot will try to float up as you wet the sand in the space between the pots. In order to solve both of these problems, I use a 4\" long 1/2 diameter bolt, and a bunch of nuts and broad washers and a bit of silicone sealant to seal the holes in both pots. The secondary benefit of this is that the inner pot can't float up because it is bolted to the same bolt that seals the outer pot. This way, you can be generous with charging the sand with water without worrying about the inner pot floating up.The first thing you need to do is to put a pair of broad washers on your bolt, put some silicone sealant on the threads, and tighten them down with a nut. Then, seal around the nut with more sealant. While the sealant is curing, use your sanding block to remove the clay burr around the hole of both pots. Be sure to sand off the burr both on the inside and the outside of the hole until the washer can lay flat against the pot. If you do not remove the burr, water will leak past the hole.Now, it is time to seal the hole in the outer pot. This works best with an assistant helping you. Lay the pot on its side, and put some silicone sealant on the clay around the hole both the inside and outside the pot; insert the shank of the bolt through the hole, and have your assistant thread on a washer and bolt it down from the other side. Wipe up any sealant that squeezes out around the washer. Then smear sealant around the nut and bolt to prevent water from leaking out around the threads.

The washer must not have its upper surface lower than the upper surface of the pot feet; if it does, the inner pot will rest on the pot feet, and won't have its hole pinched tightly by washers from above and below.Add a little bit of sand to the outer pot; you want just enough to fill the places that will be hard to get to once the inner pot is in place. Be sure there isn't sand on the washer or pot feet; the sand may prevent the inner pot from sitting flat on the washer, and will prevent a good seal. If you decide to dampen the sand to make it more easily shapable, do so BEFORE you put it into the pot, and add water using a spray bottle only until the sand has the consistency of brown sugar. Any more, and the sand sticks to everything.Once the washer is in place, seal the threads with silicone, and thread on the nut that holds the washer in place. Put some silicone on the washer so that it will seal against the bottom of the inner pot, and rest the inner pot on that washer. Then put some sealant around the hole on the inside, add another washer to the bolt, and pinch it down with a nut. Seal the threads and the gap around the nut with silicone, and wipe up any silicone that squishes out around the washer.(Unfortunately, I don't have a picture of the last step where we tightened down another washer to pinch down the inner pot.)Variation: inner pot nested an inch lowerIn the photos above, I show the pot legs used as spacers positioned upright. You can also position them laying on their sides so that the inner pot sits about an inch lower. (If you do this, be sure to use sand paper or a file to remove the clay burrs from the side edges of the pot feet, or else the inner pot won't sit properly on these spacers. Also, you can use a shorter bolt; I don't know precisely how much shorter, but probably about an inch shorter.) You can see from some of the photos in the other steps that the inner pot's upper lip sits about an inch above the later of decorative rocks. While this affords a little bit more evaporative surface, it also means the inner pot's upper edge is not surrounded by as much thermal mass as it could. Having the inner pot nested a little bit deeper also means you can use a couple of quarts less sand, which will also make the completed zeer pot just a bit lighter.The next zeer pot I build will be this variation.Note: Be sure the pot feet are close to the central boltI made a couple of mistakes in the pictures which show damp sand in the pot. Firstly, I put too much water in, and the sand started to stick to everything, which was a real hassle. Secondly, the pot feet were too spread out, and I had to move them back toward the central bolt. The reason you must have the pot feet close to the center is that the bottom of the inner pot actually has a raised perimeter. (This slightly raised perimeter can be seen in the photo from the prior step which shows me sanding the burr away from the hole.) If the pot feet end up contacting the raised perimeter, the part of the pot right around the hole won't touch the washer that you matched to the height of the pot feet, and you won't get a good seal around the hole of the inner pot.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FKY/RYYE/HW3K6AZT/FKYRYYEHW3K6AZT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQY/C4TF/HWG0DAIJ/FQYC4TFHWG0DAIJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRM/E9X9/HWG0DAIL/FRME9X9HWG0DAIL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS4/ZZ8G/HWG0DAJV/FS4ZZ8GHWG0DAJV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZA/WNZI/HWG0DAJX/FZAWNZIHWG0DAJX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNI/3IG9/HWG0DAJY/FNI3IG9HWG0DAJY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVW/NXED/HW3K6AZU/FVWNXEDHW3K6AZU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD6/HEGW/HWG0DAK0/FD6HEGWHWG0DAK0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0N/8FNZ/HW3K6BDT/F0N8FNZHW3K6BDT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFU/HS1I/HWG0DAKB/FFUHS1IHWG0DAKB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVK/8SNY/HWG0DALL/FVK8SNYHWG0DALL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9G/3QMY/HW3K6ATS/F9G3QMYHW3K6ATS.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Prepare the Washer on the Bolt to Seal the Inner Pot"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "When you buy your inner pot, you should bring your pot lid to find one that fits well.

Once the sand is in and the pot is wet, the zeer pot will be very heavy.Use a funnel to add sand. You will likely end up using all 50 pounds of sand. Add more if needed; we ended up adding a couple of quarts of extra sand you want about 1/2 inch of a gutter going all the way around, which you will fill with decorative rocks after you wet it all down.Before adding water, let all the sealant on the bolts and washers cure for at least 3 hours, or overnight for best results.Add water one quart at a time; the sand will settle, and you will probably need to add a bit more sand when the pot is saturated. When the sand is saturated, you can add the decorative rocks, and perhaps a bit more water. The rocks are not just for looks; when you re-wet your pot, the rocks dissipate the water that you're pouring into the gutter so that the stream of water doesn't cut a pit into the sand. Once the pots have their sand saturated with water, the pot will darken from water wicking through the terra cotta. Put the pot in a breezy area for the initial cool down. A breeze is absolutely necessary; it simply will not cool down enough without it.A decorative trim is one of those things that sets this zeer pot apart; people are more inclined to use beautiful things. A zeer pot that looks really nice is not going to be something you're embarrassed to use.Note: if you are using beach sand, wash the sand to remove saltIf you decide to use beach sand to fill your zeer pot, be sure you wash the sand in a couple of changes of water to purge it of salt. Salt will contribute to the mineral build up on the terra cotta that lessens the cooling effectiveness of the zeer pot.Note: water will likely pool in the inner pot after saturationDo not be alarmed if some water pools up inside your inner pot during the initial cool-down after you saturate it with water. Use a sponge to soak it up and wring the sponge over the decorative pebbles to return the water to the sand.If water accumulates inside quickly, you probably have a leak, which is a whole different problem. If your inner pot is cracked, you will need to replace it.

If you store your water in the zeer pot, or have a dedicated water chilling pot, you will have the best results, since the water you add will be cold already, and won't increase the temperature of the pot.Root cellar variantOne neat variant for keeping root vegetables and scallions fresh is to build your zeer pot, and to fill the inner pot half way up with damp sand. Then, burry your carrots and beets in the sand to store them. Damp sand will keep your root vegetables as fresh as possible by keeping them alive. You will find that they remain crisp for longer this way. Also, if you have scallions, burry the root parts in damp sand to keep them fresh. This works even better than simply keeping them cold.Please note:The zeer pot will eventually accumulate mineral build-up. Use hot water and a sponge, or perhaps a bit of lemon juice to dissolve away the minerals that crust up on the outside of the zeer pot.    The zeer pot will not be as cold as a refrigerator; it will be cool, and it will keep your food cool, but it will not chill a hot container of food down to safe temperatures.    The zeer pot needs a breeze to cool. If you have a good breeze all the time, or perhaps a small fan powered by a solar panel, the pot can get quite cold. Imagine that chill you get when you step out of a pool when the wind is blowing. Now imagine that going on all day. That's what the pot feels with a constant breeze.   High humidity will result in reduced performance. However, a friend of mine who used a zeer pot in a hot humid part of Africa told me that it still worked \"shockingly well\", so it might just work. But keep it in the shade, with a breeze.  Zeer pots actually perform better than refrigerators for many vegetables; vegetables wilt in the refrigerator because the condensation on the cooling tubes dries out the air. Refrigerators blow a lot of air over a little chilling surface that is really cold, causing the air to dry out. In contrast, the air in the zeer pot is chilled over a much larger surface that is only a little bit colder. This minimizes condensation; also, since the surface inside the pot will be moist terra cotta, the air inside will have as much moisture as possible, which keeps vegetables crisp in spite of not being as cold as a refrigerator.The zeer pot is a greener option only if you use it according to the following rule: These things can evaporate a couple gallons of water a day if you have a good breeze, especially if the weather is dry and warm. If you multiply this water consumption by several zeer pots, this can be a considerable water consuming appliance. I don't intend to unleash upon the world a device that wastes water in lieu of using electricity, especially in California, where we are experiencing a drought; I expect that everyone who uses these zeer pots to use a bucket to catch the gallons of water that you would normally waste while waiting for the shower to warm up, and to recover this water for the zeer pot.

I recycled a piece of scrap plastic from a previous project, installed it and then packed clay on the bottom and sides, inside and out. Although it worked, the clay at my site was poor and I later replaced it with red clay I purchased.Add 2 outflow pipes using 1\" Uniseal gaskets. The 1\" uniseal gasket requires a 1 3/4\" diameter hole which is easily made with a hole saw. Soapy water can be used to push the PVC pipe through the gasket. Tapering the end of the pipe makes it easier to insert as shown in pic 3. The bottom pipe is the discharge outlet and the upper pipe is an overflow pipe. Uniseal gaskets can be purchased here. https://smile.amazon.com/UNISEAL-Flexible-Tank-Ada...Behind the headwall and laying within the gravel is a dual water collection pipe (goalpost shaped) with arms roughly 30\" long. Multiple 1/4\" holes are drilled through both sides of the 1\" PVC pipe 3/4\" apart on center. This double pipe connects and passes through the bottom hole. Above the collection pipes is a single overflow pipe in case the lower pipe is unable to handle all the water. The overflow pipe has holes drilled in it in the same fashion as the other pipes.

Your spring box can be any accessible food-grade plastic container that's more than a few gallons in size. The blue barrel I used is 20 gallons and I used it only because I had it on hand. It also required more digging to bury which seems to be something I enjoy! As you bury your pipe remember to slope it downhill so water will run away from the spring. Water must be able to flow freely without pressure towards the spring box so it does not backup behind the spring headwall. 1/8\" per foot drop is sufficient, however, I increased that to 1/4\" per foot as I figured that would get me somewhere between an 1/8\" & a 1/4\" per foot. Laying a 4 foot long level on your pipe, the end of the level closest to the spring box should be 1/2\"-1\" above the pipe. 1\" divided by 4 ft = 1/4\" per foot (1/2\" = 1/8\" per foot).

We have been experiencing a drought. As such the reservoirs that supply water to our town are at very low levels. This has resulted in water restrictions being enforced by the local municipality. No topping up of swimming pools, washing cars or irrigation of any nature. I like doing all these things and therefore decided to install a reasonably well engineered rainwater harvesting system.The main purpose of this instructable is not to give a step by step breakdown of the installation of  my specific system but rather a breakdown of my design process and how it ties in with my intended water use.Obviously I include the construction part as well.

I had to extract ideas that were useful to my project from probably a hundred different videos and other sources.

For my project I have about 300 m2 of tiled roof and 100 m2 of paved area that is available to collect from. The mean annual rainfall where I live is 1200 mm per year. Thus my collection potential is 520 m3 per year. This is the theoretical maximum water that you can harvest and use per year. As you will see later on designing a system that will actually deliver close to that theoretical number can be very expensive and impractical.Once you have you your harvesting potential unfortunately you have to start subtracting from it. For this you will need to know:1) The type of surface you are collecting from OR2) How your rainfall is distributed in terms of event sizesCollection surfaces have different run-off factors. From looking around extensively (wouldn't call it research as such) it appears that corrugated iron surfaces are best in terms of heaving a high run-off factor(0.9) and thatch is bad (0.5). My house has a tiled roof for which 0.8 seems to be a good number to use. I would recommend that if you don't have a lot of rainfall data you make use of factors.  I am in the fortunate position to have a lot of rainfall data for my town. I have also been observing my gutters during rain-events. I must admit my conclusion is not super scientific but I have found that for rain-events of less than 3 mm there is virtually no water coming from the gutters. I therefore remove all rain-event smaller than 3 mm from my data set and subtract 3 mm from all the remaining events to determine my site specific annual run-off to be 944 mm per year. Thus my effective factor is 0.79 which is slightly lower than the recommended factor but quite close. If you have many small events the factors will be optimistic and if you have fewer large events the factors will be pessimistic. ", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: Determine Your Rainwater Harvesting Potential (and the Specifics of My Project)"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "How you determine this is going to be very dependent on your site and water uses. To get a good idea of how much tank volume you need you really need to have access to some good data. If you do not have access to good data you will have to fill in the blanks with estimates. Nothing wrong with that, just know the limitations and be aware of how wrong you  might be. If you are happy with your degree of wrongness and are willing to live with the consequences no big deal.My intended water uses:1) Watering the garden2) Filling up the pool3) Washing cars These are clearly not very critical uses as I intend to rely on municipal water for drinking, cooking etc. If rainwater was my only water source the following thought process would obviously be very different. My view was to get close to the most economical system and not one that could supply my drinking water year round. Storage size determination for my site.To determine the right amount of storage I chose to find the point of diminishing returns. To do this I once again consulted my trusty rainfall data. See graph. The analysis that follow does not allow for multi day events. If it rains for four days 20 mm of rain every day my tanks would be full and i would lose the last three days of opportunity. The annual usage is thus still on the optimistic side. I am sure one can calculate this but I felt that for a DIY system upon which my life does not depend it was unnecessary. Basically i didn't feel like faffing with excel anymore and was quite happy to file it under acceptable wrongness.Unfortunately there was no clear inflection point on the graph as rainfall event sizes seems to vary a lot for my area. However at eight cubic meters of installed storage the angle of the graph flattens out. It also so happens that I have a very nice spot where I can fit eight cubes of storage and didn't really have appetite to install more than that. My system allows me to capture 20 mm of run-off (23mm rain event) if the tanks are empty. And can yield up to 220 m3 per year. For those keeping track we are now at a theoretical efficiency of (220/530) 41.5%.To get my system effcience close to 79% (limited due to run-off) I would need to install 40 m3 of tanks which is just stupid in my case.

If you are lucky there is an obvious solution for your property. I have quite a big property and had many options available to me. I will discuss two main ones.1) Spread out tank optionPros:- Tanks close to main collection surface (roof)- Tanks close to electrical supply for pump- Minimal digging up of the yard for laying new pipes- Easy to install in stagesCons:- Elevation differences around the house would require sealed tank lids and stand pipes if i wanted all tanks to act as a single storage. Which I do. - Ugly piping requirements on the outside of the house- Would require sumps and pumps to capture water from paved areas- Difficult to size sump pumps as rate of rainfall varies significantly- Generally difficult to make use of 100% of my collection surfaces without unsightly  modifications to gutters2) Cluster tank optionPros:- Rainwater can gravity feed to collection- easy to make use of 100% of collection surfaces- Can hide tanks from street view and the view from inside the houseCons:- Lots of digging up my garden- Far from electrical supply- Far from existing sprinkler manifold (I would not consider moving this as it consists of nine zones.... just no!)- Have to find a solution to deal with sand washing in from paved areas.ConclusionA reasonably diligent cost estimate comparison between the two systems showed the two options to be similarly priced. The long piping distances of the cluster tanks system was offset by the cost of sump pumps. For the electrical supply it turned out the the biggest cost component was the labor of connection and the connections themselves much more than the distance of supply so in terms of electricity there wasn't a big difference. I found that I could make the system about 50% of the cost if I relaxed on my condition to capture run-off from my entire roof. I did not want to do that. I repeated the calculations from step two for this reduced system, estimated the total cost and found that the payback for the smaller system would be slightly longer than for the bigger system.I selected the \"cluster tank option\" mainly because of the minimal visual impact it would have on my property. I didn't feel like having a bunch of scattered tanks around my house.

The main reason for this is that I have a very clear set of uses for the water. Certain other design features in my system also compensate for some of the missing featuresSome notable omissions1) First flush divertersI am capturing water from my paved areas as well. It would be very difficult to use a first flush system while maintaining 100% gravity feed to my tanks. I could have installed something on some of my downspouts but my feeling is that if it is not installed in 100% of the system I might as well not use it at all.Some of the function of these will be performed by the 110mm PVC pipes that connect to the tanks. They relatively large diameter and include vertical sections. Any sand and sinking bits will remain in the lowest portions of the pipes as the water velocity in the pipes will not be sufficient to carry sand over into the tanks. I have installed an inpection hatch at the lowest point in the pipeline where I can periodically clear out sand.Small \"floaty\" particals will make it into the tanks. Each tank has about 5 cm of dead volume where these can accumulated and be cleaned out every once in a while. If they make it into the pump it is also not a big deal as they should be able to pass easily through the irrigation system.2) Gutter guardsFilter for leaves and stuff just before the tank inlet. I will just have to have the discipline to clean it regularly. I am not good with that.3) Post tank filtering an UVI am not planning to use for drinking water.

This is a bad idea, and I just happened to have luck on my side. Luckily when I borrowed my Dad's dumpy level it turned out the fall was quite a bit more than i thought. I used this information when I sourced the tanks for my system. I want the water to gravity feed into the tanks. Thus if the tanks are too high it would either not work or I would have to dig them down quite a bit. The tanks I ended up buying are 1.8m high. Although I allowed for a some digging in the option evaluations it turned out I didn't really have to to make the system work. I decided to do it anyway for two reasons:1) Hides the tanks better2) I would have more diving head to get the water into the tanks which means that I am less likely to be piping capacity constrained in heavy rainfall events. Although with 110 mm pipes I didn't foresee a problem. Mostly the hiding thing then.GeotechTo keep the sand slopes from falling into the tank stand area a small retaining wall was constructed. We left access for piping and built in provision for drainage. Tank site drainage:Given the sunken tank design drainage would be crucial for:1) Rainwater falling directly in the tank stand2) Tank overflows when the design overflow is overloaded3) Any water emanating from draining small portions of a tanks or pipes for maintenanceThis is something I overlooked initially. Luckily not too expensive in the end. I decided to install two subsoil drains. I used special fabric to wrap building rubble in and had 50mm pvc pipes leading from the site into the subsoil drainage channel. Also included a large overflow sump for those really big problems. I did no calcs on the size requirements. These we just eyeballed. Hope it works OK otherwise my pump motor and controller will be gonners next time we get 100mm of rain! They are probably undersized.

Spade length depth I have found is good.2) Try to have you pipe as a single fall to avoid sediment collecting in places you can't reach. Or make them reachable for cleaning3) Put pipes in trenches and connect using the connectors. I found it very difficult without soapy water to help the joints slip into place. I hope that the joints don't stay slippery forever.4) Do your best to share trenches between pipes, for instance I use the PVC pipe trench to connect my sprinkler manifold to the pump with HDPE pipe.Not much to say here. It just has to be done.NB NB For my system to work all the collector sites have to be higher than the inlet of the tank (hence the sump). I used a dumpy level to survey the elevations in my yard. Based on this info I determined that to get sufficient head (to deal with quick large rain events) between my collectors and the tanks I would have to drop the tank elevation by 600mm from ground level. Also in certain areas around my house I will have to add up to a meter elevation to the collectors( I fastened these to the wall with brackets, not in photo). With all these I have about 1.1 m of head between collectors and tanks.In a 40 m pipe length of 110 mm pipe this will give enough flow to cope with most rain events. Very roughly 1.1m head is about 10 kpa pressure. For a flow rate of 13 l/s the head loss is 10 kpa per 40m. Thus if the system is asked to handle more than 13 l/s the collectors will overflow. What is this in mm/hour for me?1)  13 l/s = 46.8m3 per hour2) 46.8 m3/ 400 m2 = 0.117 m = 117mm of rain in an hour3) This is enough because my tanks will fill in 15 minutes and it is about a 1 in 20 year storm for the area where I live.4) Frankly, when this happens I have bigger problems than overflowing collectors.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWA/FKHI/IO8WD4V7/FWAFKHIIO8WD4V7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2Q/2FM1/IOKN9JY3/F2Q2FM1IOKN9JY3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS7/GWL6/IOKN9JWX/FS7GWL6IOKN9JWX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVD/BNI6/IOKBWIEE/FVDBNI6IOKBWIEE.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Installing the Underground PVC Pipes"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "I am using four 2200 L tanks.

The Banger polder is a densely populated low lying area with an out-dated polder system established in the colonial era. The area is subsiding due to groundwater extractions. Currently about half of the area is situated below mean sea level. Heavy rain showers cannot be drained anymore under free flow leading to frequent pluvial and fluvial flooding. In addition the probability (and risk) of coastal flooding is increasing due to the relative see level rise. A full description of the problems in the Banger polder and potential solution strategies can be found.This project focuses on multifunctional usage of flood protection. The Dutch experience in the field of flood protection is very important in this project. For the Indonesian colleagues in Semarang a tutorial will be made about maintaining a water retaining structure.BackgroundSemarang is the fifth biggest city in Indonesia with almost 1.8 million inhabitants. Another 4.2 million people are living in the surrounding areas of the city. The economy in the city is booming, in the past years a lot has been changed and in the future there will be more changes. The urge of trading and the need of industry are causing an increasing economy, which increases the business climate. These developments cause an increase in the purchasing power of the population. It can be concluded that the city is growing, but unfortunately there is also a growing problem: the city faces floods which are frequently increasing. These floods are mainly caused by the subsidence of the inner land which is decreasing by extracting groundwater in large quantities. These withdrawals cause a subsidence of about 10 centimetres per year. (Rochim, 2017) The consequences are big: the local infrastructure is damaged which results in more accidents and traffic congestions. In addition, more and more people leave their homes as a result of the increasing floods. The locals are trying to deal with the problems, but it is more a solution to live with the problems. The solutions are abandoning the low laying homes or raising the current infrastructure. These solutions are short term solutions and will not be very effective.ObjectiveThe objective of this paper is to look into the possibilities of protecting the city of Semarang against flooding. The main problem is the sinking soil in the city, this will increase the number of floods in the future. First of all the multifunctional flood barrier will protect the inhabitants of Semarang. The most important part of this objective is to tackle the societal and professional problems. The societal problem is, of course, the flooding in the Semarang area. The professional problem is the lack of knowledge about defence against water, the subsidence of the soil layers is part of this lack of knowledge. These two problems are the fundament of this research. In addition to the main problem, it is an objective to teach the inhabitants of Semarang how to maintain a (multifunctional) flood barrier.More information about the information about the delta project in Semarang can be found in the following article;https://hrnl-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/0914548_hr_nl/EairiYi8w95Ghhiv7psd3IsBrpImAprHg3g7XgYcNQlA8g?e=REsaek", "title": "Multifunctional Floodprotection, Indonesia", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Multifunctional-Floodprotection-Indonesia/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The first step is to find the right location for a water storage area.
