I was just looking at some little round perf boards when it occurred to me that they'd be awesome as earrings, and the larger ones as necklaces. Something a bit cyber punk in nature.

So we're really under voltage, which means we really don't have to worry much. (Yes, we are cutting the life of the red LED a bit shorter.  Sue me.)To turn these on and off, just take the battery out.  There really isn't room for a switch.If you want to go crazy, find some color changing LEDs.  They just slowly fade from color to color, and have a cool look.I've gone with 3mm LEDs because of their size.  You could easily use surface mount LEDs (if you're a crazy soldering person) or some larger 5mm LEDs.

Here in Tokyo, during winter, the temperature can drop to the low 20's (F) at night and since we have no garage, her car just has to endure the cold as best it can. Many people don't realize that you don't have put up with repeated jump-starts or run to the nearest garage and plunk down 7,500 yen ($85) for a new battery every time this happens. Your old battery may just have built up a layer of lead sulphate crystals on its plates and that is preventing the acid from contacting them over their full surface area. This is caused by subjecting the battery to long periods of insufficient charge, as in the cases of unplugged golf carts over the winter, infrequently used automobiles, and PV systems that don't get enough sunlight to charge their batteries. The result is a great reduction in the battery's ability to produce electricity.\nWith a desulfator circuit you can reverse this process and rejuvenate the battery to like new condition. You can also save money and prevent water and ground pollution at the same time by keeping your old battery out of the local landfill. As long as nothing is seriously wrong with the battery it can last many times the two or three years that people typically use them. You can even get free batteries from garages that routinely throw them away, desulfate them, and never buy another battery again. Save money and help the environment - now there's a green ecology scheme I can get into!\nMost DIY desulfator circuits in use today can trace their roots back to an article in issue # 77 of Home Power magazine written by Alistair Couper in June/July of 2000. Many versions were spawned by his design but they all accomplish the same thing, that is, they use various pulsing circuits to force the lead sulphate crystals back into the electrolyte thus rejuvenating the battery and restoring its lost capacity. The version I chose uses an NE555P timer chip for the multivibrator front end and two coils, a low ESR cap, a fast diode, and an N-channel MOSFET (hereafter referred to as a FET) to generate the high voltage (50V) spikes in the output. Credit goes to Ron Ingraham for changing the design to use an N-channel FET instead of the harder to find and more expensive P-channel types in the earlier versions. Along the way I couldn't resist adding a few tricks of my own to make the design more convenient. See this link for a description of the theory and other information on desulfators.\nThis circuit can be used three ways - as a standalone device powered by the battery under test; as a standalone device but used in parallel with a battery charger; or built into a charger so that the two work together as one. I chose the third option for my circuit but added a switch so I can use either device independently. Mounting the device onto my charger also allowed me to use the charger's output cables for both functions and avoid the tangle of wires that inevitably results at the battery.\nOnce properly adjusted, the desulfator can be left on permanently whenever the charger is charging. Just be aware that no matter what configuration you choose, the desulfator is powered by the battery under test so if you use it without a charger care must be taken to avoid deep discharging the battery.High power versions of these circuits can be built for off-grid solar-cell systems as well where many batteries are typically arranged in series/parallel banks and attached to inverters to produce 120V AC. These battery banks can be desulfated en-masse while being charged by their solar arrays for a truly self-maintaining system minus the periodic checks for electrolyte level, as long as the desulfator circuit is scaled up in size sufficiently.\nThe Altoids can is the perfect box for this project as the circuit neatly fits inside it and the metal construction can shield much of the RFI that may be emitted by the output stage. You can't beat the price of these tins, and they even come with free mints, or do the mints come with a free tin, I forget... ?\nSo with the background out of the way, let's get to work!", "title": "Desulfator for 12V Car Batteries, in an Altoids Tin", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Desulfator-for-12V-Car-Batteries-in-an-Altoids-Ti/", "section": "workshop", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Here is the schematic and parts list, along with some of my pencil notes. The list is complete except for some parts (two pots, two resistors, two switches, a LED, a FET and some grommets and pop-rivets) that I salvaged out of my junk box. Feel free to do the same, just keep to the values on the schematic as much as possible. Please note that C4, a 100uf 25V electrolytic capacitor, must be a \"low ESR\" type (Equivalent Series Resistance) to limit its tendancy in this application to get hot. If you choose to use trim pots instead of resistors for R2 and R4, as I did, be careful with the adjustments as C4, D2, L1 and L2 can get very hot if the 555 chip is made to send too wide a pulse into the output stage. The resistor values in the schematic should program the 555 chip to output pulses of the proper width and limit any excess heat buildup, however. We'll discuss this further in the Smoke Test Steps. The LED can be any standard type and will only turn on when pulses are present in the output. S1 should have at least a 3A rating, and if you use a DPDT type use both sets of contacts in parallel to reduce the contact resistance as much as possible. S2, at the output of the 555, isolates the 555 from the output stage allowing you to make adjustments to the front end without risking overheating Q1, D2, C4 or the inductors.The inductors I chose are listed on the schematic at the bottom of the \"Possible Inductors from Digikey\" list. They fit the can nicely but will need to have one lead extended slightly to reach the bottom of the circuit board. In retrospect, an inductor with a slightly higher current rating for L2 might be better as the one I chose gets noticably hotter than L1 even though it has the same current rating of 2.4A. Digikey part number M8875-ND should fit the can, barely, and has a 3.6A rating, but the 2.4A coil that I'm using now really only gets hot if I get too aggressive with the pulse width adjustments.D2 is a FRED (Fast Reacting Epitaxial Diode) and should not be substituted with any old diode in your junk box as the latter will probably not work well in this circuit. If it gets too hot you can use two in parallel to double the current capacity, but again, if you keep the pulse width on the conservative side it will only get slightly warm. The FET listed works very well and is inexpensive. I mounted mine directly on the perf-board with a piece of stick-on copper foil (available from Digikey) under it to act as a heatsink. In this configuration it doesn't get warm at all so the copper foil may not actually be needed. Be aware that the metal tab on the FET is also attached to pin 2 (drain) so if you attach the FET to a heatsink you'll have to electrically isolate it from the rest of the circuit. I also used a TO-220 transistor socket to allow easy replacements but you can wire the FET in directly if you prefer. Just avoid touching pin 1 (gate) while handling it as it is very ESD (static) sensitive.Also, I opted to use the \"Turn-off Enhancement Circuit\", shown in the schematic as Q2, D3, and R5, as it helps the FET to turn off more precisely. If you use these parts do not use C2 and R3.

Use a disk sander, if you have one, or a sanding block if you don't, to clean up the edges. You'll find that the fiberglass board cuts and sands easily. If sized correctly, the circuit will sit nice and snug inside the can with no mounting screws or other hardware needed to hold it in place, yet be removeable for fit tests or repairs if needed.Next, place the parts loosely in the Altoids can to get an idea of where you'd like to mount them. My layout roughly follows the schematic and limits the number of jumper wires needed to make connections. I'm sure there are better layouts but what you see worked well enough for me so feel free to copy it. Early on I'd planned on bolting the FET to the lid so the lid could act as a heatsink but this turned out to be unnecessary. There's just enough room on the perf-board for it and a socket, and since it doesn't get hot at all, no additional heatsinking is required. You'll need to insulate the metal can from the circuitry by cutting some thin cardboard to cover the bottom, lid, and sides. The \"wiggle-room\" mentioned above is to allow space for the cardboard sides. Later on, you'll mount the cardboard in with double-stick tape but for now leave the cardboard out while you drill the holes in the can. The output wires will exit a 5/16\" hole in the left side, and in this hole you'll fit a 1/4\" rubber grommet. Start small and go gradually up in size with the drill bits as the metal is thin and soft and bends quite easily. Remove the flash with a countersink bit, if you have one, or a larger drill bit twisted with your fingers. Use something round and hard, like the shaft end of a large drill bit or the ball end of a small ball-peen hammer, to flatten the holes after drilling. Don't forget to allow room for the lid which overhangs the sides a 1/4\" or so. The vent holes around the right side are 1/8\" diam and spaced about 1/2\" apart. A center punch helps a lot here but a nail works as well to dimple the metal a bit to better aim the drill. I also drilled a hole in the lid for the LED so I can see it when the lid is closed. You can do the same but you'll have to measure carefully where it will go after you decide where to put the LED in your layout. Mine fitted nicely inside L1. You'll have to also punch a hole in the lid's cardboard liner for the LED to shine through.Place the cardboard side strip in the can and tack-tape it in place, then use a pen to mark the holes from outside the can. Use a hole punch to punch holes in the cardboard exactly over the marks you made.If you decide to mount the can to the back of your charger you'll need to drill four more holes in the bottom for whatever fastening hardware you want to use (I used pop-rivets). You can also make the circuit separate from your charger but you'll have to add lead wires and some clips to attach the circuit to your battery. The parts list shows some clip parts that I used but you may prefer larger ones. The lead wires should be made of at least 16 ga flexible wire, thicker if you can get it, and as short as comfortably possible to avoid losses at the battery. Even if you plan to wire your circuit into your charger it's a good idea to make temporary leads with clips so you can debug the circuit before permanently mounting it.Once the holes are punched you can double-stick tape the cardboard strip and lid pieces in place and fit the grommet. For now, don't tape the bottom piece in, just use it as an insulator as you build and troubleshoot your circuit. This will allow you to pop-rivet the can onto the charger when the time comes and you can then tape the cardboard in permanently over the pop-rivets. If you don't plan to mount your can onto your charger then it's OK to go ahead and tape in the bottom piece.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFT/ITRR/FQMXEPZA/FFTITRRFQMXEPZA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0Q/PQJS/FQMXEQ01/F0QPQJSFQMXEQ01.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQL/ZWZC/FQMXBO6B/FQLZWZCFQMXBO6B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE7/UEIJ/FQMXBO6C/FE7UEIJFQMXBO6C.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Build the Box and Start Your Layout."}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "On small one-off circuits like these I don't bother with designing printed circuit boards. I just wire them up on perf-board using the cut off leads of the various components to solder them together in a kind of \"connect the dots\" fashion. Keeping the layout in roughly the same order as the schematic helps to visualize the top and bottom of the board as you assemble it. For the longer runs use 24 ga hook-up wire or some cuttings from a telephone cable if you can find one.It's important to use a good quality soldering iron with a thin tip and good 60/40 solder as it gets a bit cramped, especially around the 555 chip socket. Definitely use a socket for the chip as you can easily overheat the chip during assembly and troubleshooting. Small needle-nosed pliers will help with manipulating the leads and in holding them in place for soldering. I used SMT parts for the electrolytic caps because they were the smallest low ESR caps I could find. If you use the same ones solder your own leads onto the pads and wire them up as if they were normal discrete components paying attention to the polarity (see schematic).Once you know exactly where to put it, glue the FET socket to the perf-board with CA glue. I used a nylon bolt to bolt the FET down but as long as the tab is isolated from the rest of the circuit any small bolt will do.I also used a strip of stick-on copper foil, cut from a 6\" wide sheet, along the bottom edge for a ground bus. Digikey sells the sheets by the foot and it's marvelous stuff as it can be used for making ground planes, RFI shields, heatsinks, and many other uses. My wife enjoys making stained glass items and the rolls of copper foil she uses are also perfect for this task. You can pretty much make your own \"printed\" circuits with these rolls, sans the etching steps, if you like, but it's not necessary with this circuit.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTW/68U5/FQMXFGKC/FTW68U5FQMXFGKC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA5/7Z6N/FQMXFGKD/FA57Z6NFQMXFGKD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW9/Y8FH/FQMXFGKA/FW9Y8FHFQMXFGKA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRR/WRGJ/FQMXFGNA/FRRWRGJFQMXFGNA.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Build Your Circuit."}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "It's time to test your handiwork! For those of you who used fixed resistors for R2 and R4, skip this step and go on to the next step, Smoke Test 2. For those of you who used pots instead of fixed resistors for R2 and R4:First, turn off S2, put a 555 chip in its socket and a 2A fuse in the fuse holder. Set the pots to their mid-range and attach the plus lead clip of your circuit to the plus terminal of a 12V battery. Attach the ground lead clip of your circuit to the minus probe of a multimeter, and set the multimeter to the 10A AC scale. Briefly touch the plus probe of the meter to the minus terminal of the battery. Check for smoke. No smoke? Good! Try it for 5 seconds, then 10 seconds. Still no smoke? Great! Check the 555. Hang a scope probe (if you have one) on pin three of the chip and check for pulses. Adjust R4 for peak output at around 1000 Hz (the exact level isn't critical). Now check the output stage. Turn on S2 and briefly touch the plus probe of the meter to the minus battery terminal. You should see a brief spark and hear a faint 1000 Hz tone come from the coils. The LED will turn on in the presence of output pulses. If it doesn't, but you hear the tone, then the LED may be mounted backwards. If you don't hear the tone, or see smoke, then something is wrong and you'll need to check your output stage wiring. If the fuse blows try adjusting R2 down a bit (the direction of turn depends on how you have it wired). Smile when you get the meter reading below 0.8A -- you're almost there!If all is good then adjust R2 so the meter shows no more than 0.7A on the AC scale. This should yield a good output into the battery without overheating the output stage. Finger test the coils, C4, FRED, and the FET. If all are no more than slightly warm after 30 minutes then you're in the clear. You can SLIGHTLY increase the pulse width and the current into the meter a little at a time until the circuit reaches about 1.0A but at this level my charger won't flip into trickle charge mode because the combined currents of the circuit and charger are beyond its trickle threshold. I therefore keep it at around 0.7A. Anything beyond 1.0A gets a bit too toasty after a night's use anyway. Also note that the circuit will tend to consume 0.2A to 0.3A more current and get hotter when the charger is on high charge rate. It's therefore best to stay at or below 0.7A to prevent the current from getting too high as the charger adjusts its charge rate from high to low. Be conservative, especially with an undercharged battery because as the lead sulphate crystals dissolve into the electrolyte the battery voltage climbs and this increases the current and the heat dissipated by the output components.

If you decide to keep your desulfator separate from your charger you can skip the Hacking the Charger step, but you'll need to attach clips and output leads to your circuit so you can attach it to your battery.You'll need to drill six holes, one 5/16\" diam for the leads to enter the charger, one 1/2 \" diam for the switch (if you use the same style toggle switch that I used), and four 1/8\" diam holes for the pop-rivets. Drill one pop-rivet hole, put in a pop-rivet and mount the box to the charger, then drill and pop-rivet the three remaining holes in succession. Be careful with the metal shards and thoroughly blow out your charger with compressed air after you're done drilling and shaping the holes. Also watch out that the drill bits don't accidentally damage anything inside. One wire got caught in a bit when I did this and had to be repaired later. Mount your switch and put a 1/4\" rubber grommet in the lead hole. Wire up the switch per the schematic using both sets of contacts in parallel if you use a DPST or DPDT type, and keep the leads as short as possible. This switch also becomes a good place to hang a multimeter for checking the current drain later on.The final wiring step is to solder the leads to your charger's output wires. I prefer splicing into the wires themselves rather than tacking on the circuit board or internal components to avoid damage to those components. The output leads should be quite thick so care must be taken when splicing into them. Partial dissassembly of the charger may be required as well. Be thorough with the solder but don't overheat the insulation. Cover the splices with 1/2\" diam heat-shrink tubing and shrink them down with a heat gun. FYI: Sometimes a hair blower will suffice for a heat gun if you use or make a nozzle with a 1/2\" x 2\" slit opening. The over-temp sensor that all hair blowers have may shut down the blower after a few minutes but you don't need to keep it on very long. Use the blower's high heat and low fan settings if you can. Failing that, I often use a monokote heat gun normally used for building model airplanes as it's cheap ($20), reliable, and comes with the right sized nozzle.

Lead-acid batteries (and desulfators and chargers, for that matter) work best when the battery is warm. A cold day can sap 50% or more of the charge out of your battery. Because I don't have a warm garage I may just have to wait until warm weather returns before I can fully do the circuit justice in testing it. \r\nMy Internet sources tell me that batteries may take a month or more to reverse the effects of heavy sulfation.

My battery now charges to over 13.4 volts after a full charge. Before desulfator treatment it would not rise beyond 12.7 volts. This is a very good sign meaning that the plates are now much cleaner, the electrolyte is now contacting their full surface area, and that full electricity production has been restored. I kind of wish I could verify this visually but I can't due to the battery being a sealed type. For now, I'll have to be satisfied with just reading the improvement in my voltmeter. \r\nSome notes:\r\n1. During testing I found that my charger has no real trickle rate mode and instead stops the charge entirely when it decides that enough charge has entered the battery. Call it an idle state instead of a trickle rate. If left like this, after a full charge the battery voltage will slowly drop to about 12.2 volts within a week or so (further if I let it), which I assume is a reflection of the battery's natural decay rate plus the amount of charge being consumed by the circuit itself. I therefore, every few days, top off the battery by turning the charger's power switch off, then on again to restart the high charge rate.\u00a0 A few hours later I\u00a0make sure that the red LED has turned off and the green LED has turned on meaning that the charger has finished the charge and gone back to its idle state. The desulfator is then free to do its thing without interference from the charger. \r\n2. There is a marked drop in pulse peak voltage from about 50 volts, measured at fuse F1, to about 36 volts measured at the battery. This is due to losses in the cabling going to the battery. You can limit these losses by keeping the cables as thick and as short as possible. 12 or even 10 ga wire is not too thick as long as you can solder it and it is flexible enough to not make the circuit unwieldy. If you use thinner wire just know that the circuit will still work but that the reduced voltage at the battery will take longer to recondition it. My thanks to DRZCYY for bringing this to my attention. \r\n3. Use of wire loops to hold down the two coils can simulate a shorted winding in the coils and result in slightly reduced output. It's best to use plastic or nylon tie wraps for this purpose.

Out of the eight batteries I have purchased over the years four have failed out side of the warranty  period, plus two failed within or just after the end of the warranty and were replaced at no charge by Makita.It seems there are two main failure causes, number one over heating and the second is the first two cells fail due to them being used to power the battery management chip and slowly discharging over an extended idol period.  This causes the battery to be unbalanced.  Once you get the red / green flashing lights three times on the charger your battery control board locks the battery from being recharge again.I will be concentrating on replacing the battery control board as frequently this is all you need to do to get things up and running, although if you do require new cells these can be changed pretty easily.  Makita seem to use the Sony Konion LiMn cells and these are available online for between fire and ten pounds each or you can frequently pick up failed batteries on ebay and cannibalise these for parts. If you do  need to replace cells spot welding to the cells is the best way to go, as if you solder you risk overheating.

This is held on by four T10 Anti Tamper screws, on newer models there may be a white Anti Tamper plug covering one of the screws.  I have found that the easiest way to remove it is to drive in a small wood screw and pull it out with a pair of pliers. Once you have the battery open being careful that the retaining clip spring does not fly away or short out the control board you should be able to see if there are any obvious major issues.  The first time I open one of these batteries up I was surprised how much dust had made its way into the batteries, I soon learned to keep my charger away from dust and never to charge them on the floor!If on opening you seen any visibly damaged cells you are going to have to replace them which is outside of the scope of this write up.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F4Q/C5XM/I6NICJIB/F4QC5XMI6NICJIB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2K/RJIG/I6NICJHW/F2KRJIGI6NICJHW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Dismantling & Inspection "}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "I had four failed batteries, and checked the voltages of the batteries and cell pairs individually.

Upon opening up the battery there is obvious damage to the second pair of cells. Battery Two: Fails to charge with classic red / green flashing lights. It is 12.84v across the battery and 3.2v, 0v, 3.22v, 3.22v & 3.21v across each of the cell pairs respectively. Battery Three: Fails to charge with classic red / green flashing lights.

It is 18.15v across the battery and 3.62v, 3.63v,3.6, 3.63 &3.62v across each of the cell pairs respectively.By way of comparison a known good battery seems to measure around 20v when freshly charged.So I decided that my best option to end up with an extra working battery was to change the board on Battery Four as its cells were all pretty close on voltage suggesting it was fairly evenly charged.  Up until recently replacement circuit board were not available so once you had seen the red / green flashing lights three times your battery was bricked.  However recently they have become available for a round \u00a310 which is certainly much cheaper than a replacement battery.Fixing the other batteries is going to be a little more challenging.

Using the 1cm diameter cable, make as many loops as possible through the space where the secondary windings used to be (in my case that's 3), then extend the rest of the cable to the front where the electrodes are and attach them on, after screwing the finished transformer onto the structural skeleton base plate 3.

By using a thinner copper wire I gain resistance to avoid too much current flowing through it, I also gain magnetic flux, due the increased number of turns, this will translate into more efficiency. The problem with this coil is the wire is so thin it won't be able to sustain itself, so I took two pieces of the same wire I used to make the other loop and I joined them together by twisting them, by making this I make sure there's no electrical contact between both ends. Now, I poke holes though the coil with a needle and pass the wire though, it takes some bending, but after a while I tie the wire to the coil and align it properly. This coil is almost complete, I now just have to scrape a bit of the wire inside the coil to solder its ends, then I scrape the ends of the wire as I did with the other coil.

So now to how this circuit works.  First, when power is applied to the circuit, the current flows into the base of the transistor, turning it on.  When the transistor turns on, it lets power flow through the primary coil.  This induces a current into the secondary coil, which flows into the base of the transistor, turning it off.  When the transistor turns off, the magnetic field collapses letting current flow back into the base of the transistor from the resistor.  This cycle repeats many times a second.  Think of this circuit as a swing, if you push somebody an a swing, they will swing forward and backwards and oscillate.  Every time you push the swing, it oscillates, but you have to push it at the right time, or it will loose energy.  The circuit functions like the person pushing the swing.  The transistor \"pushes\" the secondary coil with a magnetic field at the exact right time. This circuit oscillates at about 398 kilocycles.  The constantly expanding and collapsing field creates a powerful RF field around the exciter.  This causes the electrons in the CFL to bounce around and strike the phosphors in the glass, lighting the bulb.  It creates high voltage because of the turn ratio of the primary to secondary coil.  Now to actually building the slayer exciter.

The component itself can also react differently to different signals. Electronic components are also small enough to a part of a device that contains many electronic components - all controlled by the microprocessor. Electric components don't process electricity - you supply them with a current, and they turn on.There's nothing to stop you from using an electronic component in a simple circuit - ie, not connecting a microprocessor to our circuit. That's what we are doing here, using an LED, a Light Emitting Diode electronic component in our simple circuit. We will just supply the LED with electricity from a battery, and it will light up.

The combination of being directly attached to the motherboard, heat, and constant moving and shifting leads the connector to become loose and sloppy. Eventually the connection stops working altogether. Apple has solved this problem on their laptops by use of a magnetic power adaptor, unfortunately for us they also patented the idea.\nThis is my version of a magnetic power adaptor for an Acer 1410 laptop, You should be able to modify the steps fairly easily for work for any laptop though. It is effective, easy to build with common materials, and takes the strain off of the internal connection and motherboard. It also holds on well enough to not come off unless it is supposed to.\nEdit: There have been some changes to the design, mostly involving using thin copper foil in place of aluminum duct tape. There were heat issues involving the aluminum tape, these issues have been resolved by swapping out the aluminum tape for copper foil.

I went through about 6 before i got the perfect length\nThe first thing to do is put the pin from the Wire Stud into the socket, the hollow side should fit over the stock socket center pin easily. You may want to crimp the hollow end a bit to give it a tighter hold on the stock center pin.\nNow put in the insert you made in the last step.\nNext is to slowly cut bits of the center pin off, testing with your plug adaptor to make sure you haven't cut too much off. \u00a0Stop when you reach a length that allows your magnets to sit flush with the large washer of the insert while still allowing the center pins to make a connection.\nWhen you find the right length you should wrap the pin with a bit of electrical tape to keep it from shorting out on the sides of the magnets when it is charging. Just be sure to leave the tip exposed.\nOnce you are close to the right length it may help to epoxy the socket insert down and leave the magnets un-epoxied. That way you have a bit of play on the magnet side to adjust and ensure a connection before you finalize the whole deal.\nWhen you epoxy the insert down make sure it is sitting flush and hold it for a few minutes until it sets.\nI would suggest that when you epoxy the insert down you take care not to get any epoxy into the actual socket of the laptop, just try to keep it only on the underside of the larger washer.

Michael Faraday and Joseph Henry discovered the principles of electromagnetic induction at much the same time. Faraday published the results of his work in 1831, before Henry, and so gets the credit. Strange to say, many scientists of Faraday's time did not accept his findings, chiefly because he had no mathematics to back it up (Faraday's laboratory work was empirical and intuitive, and belonged to an older school of scientific research usually called Natural Philosophy). Alessandro Volta had invented the electric pile, or battery, in 1800. By 1820, Hans Christian Oersted discovered the first half of the link between electricity and magnetism when he found charged wires affected a compass needle. It remained for Faraday to close the loop when he showed how magnetism could be used to generate electricity. This was called electromagnetic induction, and it was another step on a long road of scientific and technological achievement that led to all of us sitting in front of computers, reading Instructables.com on the Internet. Electromagnetic induction is the creation of potential difference (voltage) through a conductor when it is exposed to a varying or moving magnetic field. Faraday discovered this in the course of several famous experiments I will not detail here. This effect can be demonstrated with a simple coil of fine copper wire and a magnet, but that's not nearly as interesting as building a device that will generate electricity, charge almost any type of battery, light up a bright LED, and look cool while doing it. So for this project of Making Light from Magnetism, let me next introduce the Bedini SSG device.", "title": "Making Light From Magnetism: Electromagnetic Induction & the Bedini Machine", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Making-Light-from-Magnetism-Electromagnetic-Induct/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Here's a short video of a Bedini SSG machine in operation. The early part is dark, as I left the lights off to better see the flashing LED. Some of the video is shaky, due to the use of a very small handheld digital camera.John Bedini has had a long career in electronics and audio engineering. As the story goes, he designed a simple motor-generator for a friend's daughter to make as a school science fair project. This became know as his \"School Girl\" motor, later adapted as the \"Simplified School Girl\" (SSG) motor. Bedini has his own theories about energy which are not widely supported by scientists, but it is not my purpose to present his theories or criticize them. What the SSG device does is pretty clear, and that's what we're going to build. Though the SSG is under patent, anyone is allowed to build one for their own use. My version here is not endorsed by John Bedini, his company, or anyone but myself. I learned to build it after studying videos of working versions on the Internet, drawing on my own past experiments in building electrical projects at home. MATERIALS LIST TO BUILD A 16 INCH BEDINI SSG MOTOR/GENERATOR *1 16 x 1 inch aluminum bicycle wheel (no tire!). The rim can be plastic, spoked or spokeless, but it can't be steel. The rim must be non-magnetic. *12 ceramic-ferrite magnets, preferably rated C8. (This is a rating of magnetic intensity.) I used rectangular magnets bought from a dealer on eBay, but you can get the same magnets from Radio Shack, Catalog #: 64-1895 or online. The magnets do not have to be any certain shape, but they ought to be large enough to affix to the inch-wide bicycle rim. Contrary to what you often hear and read, you do not have to use expensive neodymium magnets; in fact, in some applications they can be too strong for successful operation. *1 1/2 inch wide, 14 or 15 inch diameter rubber bike wheel liner. These are sold to protect inner tubes from rubbing against the heads of the spokes. *1 transistor. The common and cheap 2N3055 works fine. Other types will work as well, just make sure they can handle the voltage.. *1 potentiometer, with resistance varying between 1 Ohm to 5,000 Ohms. This will allow you to tune the device and regulate the speed of the wheel. *2 diodes, 1 1N4001 and 1 1N4007. *1 470 Ohm resistor. *1 Ne-2 high voltage miniature neon bulb. *a 3 x 6 inch piece of perforated circuit board, like this stuff. The exact dimensions are flexible, so long as you have room for all the components. *about 300 feet each of two gauges of enamel coated magnet wire. The wire should be about 4 gauges different. I used 20 gauge and 24 gauge. Don't use too fine a gauge or the higher resistance may interfere with the proper function of the bifilar coil. *1 coil form. I used an old plastic spindle formerly wound with speaker wire. It measures 3 inches in diameter and stands 3 inches high. The hollow center, which you will pack with iron to make an electromagnet, is 1 inch in diameter. Don't use a metal spool, or any spool with metal in it. *Iron or steel wire, or thin rods to fill the core of the coil form. Many people building SSGs use welding rods. I used wire surveyor's flags, those whip-like orange flags you find in big box hardware stores. They're used to mark out land for surveying. They're 16 gauge, stiff, but flexible. Pull off the plastic pennant and you've got a good 1.75 feet of steel wire per flag. To fill up a 3 x 1 inch cylinder, you'll need maybe a dozen flags. *Connecting wire. I used 22 gauge plastic coated bell wire (also called annunciator wire or hookup wire). You'll need 10-12 feet. *9 ring connectors, sized to fit 22 gauge wire and able to slip over 8/32 bolts. *4 brass 8/32 bolts, 2 inches long, with 1 washer and 2 nuts apiece. *3 alligator clips, 2 inches long each. *2 nylon zip ties, 12 inches long *Basswood or pine sticks, squared, 1/2 inch x 1/2 inch, at least 16 inches' worth. Also 1 piece of 3/8 x 3/8 inch basswood, 6 inches long. *Poplar rods, square, 1.5 x 1.5 inches, at least 38 inches' worth. This is for the upright wheel supports and braces, if desired. *1 pine plank. 16 x 15 x 1 inches. This is your base. The exact measurements of this are flexible, but it ought not be much smaller than this. *Optional: 6 2 x 2 inch L brackets, with 4 screws per bracket. Use these to brace the upright if you don't want to make wooden braces. *4 rubber or plastic appliance 'feet' with screws. *Super glue, and plenty of it. *6 2 inch wood screws. I used short deck screws, but any flat-headed wood screw will do. *2 batteries of matching output. This particular wheel works fine with 6 or 12 volt batteries, or with smaller batteries linked in series to total 6-12 volts. Alkaline or lead-acid batteries work equally well, and what's more surprising, you can charge both kinds with the SSG's output. *For the induction coil and light I used a ready-made set made by Reelight, made in the United Kingdom but available from various retailers in the USA. All Reelight sets work much the same way, with a factory-made induction coil, connecting wire. and LED light. You can make your own coil, but the Reelight set is handy and attractive. TOOLS: power drill, miter saw, screwdriver, wire cutters, crimp tool, soldering iron and solder, medium and fine sanding block or paper, varnish or other clear wood finish, a brush to apply it. A carpenter's square, rule, and pencil would be useful too.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FU2/CEUT/HOR811LK/FU2CEUTHOR811LK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: The Bedini Machine"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Let's make the only moving part of the Bedini machine first. Take your non-magnetic bicycle rim and make sure it is thoroughly clean and straight. I got my rim from a bike salvage yard, though I later bought a simple 26 inch rim new from an online bike parts dealer. Aside from being clean and true, the most important thing about your wheel is that it turn as freely as possible. New or used, you'll have to clean the bearings. Bike grease is too thick for our purpose, so disassemble the wheel hub and get all the heavy lube out. Spray the clean bearings and hub with a light silicone or WD40 lube. Reassemble the hub, but don't tighten the axle nuts too tight. Keep the hub from wobbling, but let it spin as freely as it can. Next, prepare your magnets. STUDY THE PHOTOS. We're going to fit the rectangular magnets at right angles to the bike rim; that way any variation in the track of the rotating rim will not reduce the coverage of the magnet on the driving coil's core. It's vital that all the magnets face outward with the same pole--in this case, NORTH--so that the driving coil can push them along. C8 ferrite magnets are seldom marked as to polarity, so you'll have to figure this out yourself. One way to do this is to use a pocket compass. The flat faces of the magnets are the poles. Test one by pushing one face toward the North end of the compass needle. Because opposite poles attract and like poles repel, the North point of a compass is actually the South pole of the magnetized pointer. To identify the North pole of your C8 magnets, they should attract the North point of the compass needle. This is important, so take care with this process. Mark the magnets in some temporary way (a bit of tape, or post-it note). ID the North poles of all the magnets. (Alternately, if you have a bar or horseshoe magnet with poles labeled, it's easy to find the North poles of your ferrite magnets.) Get your 1/2 inch basswood stick and cut 12 short pieces exactly as wide as the C8 magnets. Remove any burrs with sandpaper. Glue the basswood blocks in the center of the South side of each magnet. Use super glue. Let dry completely. Depending on the shape of the bike rim, you may have to trim the basswood blocks to fit inside the wheel channel. Refer the photos to understand what I mean. You want the wood to fit snugly into the rim while the magnet sits tight across the rim. I designed the 16 inch wheel to work with 12 C8 magnets. To space them evenly, glue the first magnet in place over the hole in the rim (the hole meant for the inner tube stem). This rim has 18 spokes per side, 36 in all. That means you should have 3 spoke heads between each magnet. If you're careful, you can do this by eye. Use liberal amounts of super glue on the wood blocks and press them into place every 3 spoke heads. Let dry thoroughly. When all 12 magnets are in place, take the rubber rim protector and stretch it over the magnets. This will help keep the magnets in place and protect them as they spin.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F7N/HWJM/HOR811M2/F7NHWJMHOR811M2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F06/UO1S/HOR811O0/F06UO1SHOR811O0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE8/53JN/HOR811MG/FE853JNHOR811MG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW9/JN17/HOR811MK/FW9JN17HOR811MK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKF/79IM/HOR811MB/FKF79IMHOR811MB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIM/YM5O/HOR811M3/FIMYM5OHOR811M3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTU/YC4B/HOR811MR/FTUYC4BHOR811MR.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Making the Wheel"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Building a solid base for the Bedini wheel is simple carpentry, but you want things to be as square and accurate as possible. Your wheel will run much more smoothly if the base is well made. Take your base plank (in my case, a piece of pine planking 16 x 15 x 1 inches) and affix a rubber \"foot\" to each underside corner. These will help dampen vibrations when running and make it easier to pick up the machine and move it. On the top side of the plank, mark the exact center with a carpenter's square and pencil. The bifilar coil that drives the machine will be here. Mark your square poplar rods to length for the upright supports. Allowing for the driver coil, its mount, and the radius of the 16 inch bike wheel, the uprights on my machine measure 11 5/8 inches tall. Measure them out but don't cut them yet! At what will be the top end of one support, find the center of the rod. Mine measure 1 1/2 inches wide, so the center would be at 3/4 inch. Here you need to drill a 3/8 inch hole all the way through the wood. Use a drill press if you have one, to insure the hole is 90 degrees to the wood. Once drilled, cut the support in two right through the center of the hole. You're making a trough or track for the bike wheel's axle to lie in. If you've done your work carefully, you should be able to use the other piece of poplar already bored and cut as the other upright. Be very, very sure the uprights are of the same length so that the wheel axle will lie square and straight. Using a drawing compass, draw a circle on the center of the base plank 3 inches in diameter. This is where the driver coil will go. Mark an intersecting line through the center point, dividing the base into two equal halves. Now, the axle of the bicycle rim I used to make the magnet wheel is 5 1/2 inches long. You want to site your uprights along that intersecting line you drew (with the top grooves aligned with each other) no more than 7 inches apart, measured from the outside edge of one poplar upright to the other. Center the posts on the line at the necessary width and temporarily glue them down with super glue. The upright will need braces. The simplest thing to do is to use three L shaped steel brackets, 2 x 2 inches, centered on the three outside faces of the upright. Mark the screw hole positions in pencil, drill pilot holes, and use the screws supplied with the brackets to anchor the uprights. Alternately, you can make braces out of the same 1 1/2 inch square poplar stock used to make the uprights. Cut two equal 6 inch pieces with 45 degree miters on each end (both cuts sloping in) Stick these in place against the base and uprights with super glue, then drill pilot holes at either end and insert 2 inch wood screws. You'll notice in the photos of my device I used both methods, brackets and braces. I was experimenting with both methods, but only one is necessary to secure the uprights. When the upright are installed and properly braced, sand them lightly and apply a coat of varnish or polyurethane coating. Let dry and move on to the next step.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FT6/B5AM/HOR811LM/FT6B5AMHOR811LM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6D/EZ8A/HOR811MM/F6DEZ8AHOR811MM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVX/MRW3/HOR811LV/FVXMRW3HOR811LV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F54/X563/HOR811M1/F54X563HOR811M1.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: A Solid Base"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "\"Bifilar\" means made of two threads or windings over a common core. An essential feature of the Bedini machine is the use of two gauges of wire on a single coil. This allows a single coil to perform two functions at the same time; in this case, one winding pulses DC voltage to the core, creating a pulsing electromagnet, while the other winding acts as an induction coil, generating electricity that is routed to the battery being charged. The usual design specs of this kind of coil require two gauges of copper magnet wire about 4 diameters apart--in this case 20 and 24 gauge. To reproduce the coil shown, you'll need about 300 feet of both gauges and a coil form to wrap them around. I used an old speaker wire spindle, 3 inches in diameter, three inches high, with a center opening 1 inch in diameter. Take the ends of the two wires and start them from separate points on the bottom inside of the coil form. Many spools have openings here, but you may have to drill holes of your own. Make sure the wires start 180 degrees apart. Leave a generous length of free wire to start with-- 8 inches or so. Next, tape the wires to the inside of the spindle just inside the holes. Carefully wrap them in the same direction, letting them come together like a single strand. Keeping moderate tension on the wires, wrap them smoothly along the core to the opposite end, then reverse direction. Keep repeating this until you fill the coil form or run out of wire. When you get near the last of the wire, make sure you finish winding at the same end of the coil you started. Drill a pair of holes in the spindle 180 degrees apart, aligned just like the ones you started with. Divide the two gauges of wire and route them through the holes so that you end up with a pattern like this: [outside] > 20 gauge -- 24 gauge -- 20 gauge -- 24 gauge < [outside] This is from one side to the other, from outside to inside back to outside again. Mark the ends of the tape with temporary tags made of masking tape, ID'ing the gauge and position (i.e., \"20 outside, 24 inside,\" etc.) Wrap the exterior of the coil with electrical tape. Secure the end of the tape by putting a nylon zip tie around the coil. (See photos for details). Now it's time to make the core. The core will be magnetized and re-magnetized over and over again, so it must be made of ferrous metal. Preferably the core should be made of many small diameter pieces rather than a single solid rod. This will ease the rise and collapse of the magnetic field. Iron is best, but real iron might be hard to find. For my machine I bought a bundle of surveyor's flags and cut the steel shafts into 3 inch lengths. One by one I put these in the hollow core of the coil. When it got full, I tapped the shafts in with a hammer. Hold the core up to the light to spot gaps. When the core is as full as it can be, put a few drops of super glue on it to hold it together. The coil should be mounted in the center of the base, squarely between uprights. Cut two short length of 3/8 inch basswood 3 inches long. Glue these to the bottom of the coil on either side of the core. Keep the ends of the wires free of the glue, then use more super glue to stick the coil to the base. Get the four wire leads running out of the same side. Let everything dry. Using a ruler or square, draw a light pencil line about 6 inches long parallel to the uprights and 2 inches out from them. This should be on the same side where the coil wires come out. Mark the line with 4 equally spaced points Drill these all the way through the base with a 8/32 bit. Insert a 2 inch 8/32 brass bolt from underneath into each hole. Add a washer to each bolt, a nut, and snug them down. Cut the wire leads from the coil long enough to comfortably reach the brass bolts, one wire per bolt. With sandpaper or a knife blade, clean the enamel insulation from the end of each wire. About 1/4 inch cleared is good. Put an aluminum ring post on the end of each wire and crimp in place. Slip a ring post over each brass bolt. Don't secure them yet.

In describing how to make the Bedini circuit board, I may use inexact or improper terminology, but I shall try to make everything clear. Start with a 3 x 6 inch rectangle of perf board. The holes may not be large enough for the transistor's pins, so keep a drill on hand with a small bit (5/64) to enlarge any holes as necessary. Have a look at your 2N3055 transistor. There are three possible connections to a TO-3 type transistor: the Base, the Emitter, and the Case, or Collector. The case is of course the metal shell of the component. The emitter and base are the two pins protruding from the flat underside. But which is which? Looking at the pin side of the transistor, you'll notice the pins are not centered. They're sited a little more to one end than the other. Orient the 2N3055 so that the pins are closer to the bottom than the top. Then notice the pins are not evenly aligned. The left pin should be a little higher than the one on the right. The higher pin on the left is the Emitter. The lower pin on the right is the Base. Insert the pins through holes in the perf board, centered and sited about a quarter of the way from the top of the perf board. You can tack the transistor in place with a drop of super glue. Take the 1N4001 diode and connect it between the Emitter and Base. The silver bar on the diode indicates the direction electricity will flow (toward the silver band), so the silver band must point toward the Base pin. Wind the leads closely around the Emitter and Base pins. Attach one lead from the 470 Ohm resistor to the Base pin and solder in place. Have a light touch with the solder and don't overheat the transistor. Push the free end of the resistor through any convenient hole in the perf board. Drill a 1/4 inch hole in the perf board, a quarter of the length up from the bottom of the board. Potentiometers often have an anchor tab on one side; enlarge a hole for it and insert the pot through both holes in the board. Secure with the nut included with the pot. Refer to the photos for a clearer idea how things go together. Solder or crimp the free end of the resistor lead (now on the rear side of the perf board) to about 2 inches of 22 gauge single strand, plastic insulated, copper wire. Strip the other end of this wire and solder it to leftmost terminal of the 1-5K potentiometer (leftmost as you are looking straight on at it). While you're there, solder on about 8 inches of the same type 22 gauge wire to the center terminal of the pot. The far right terminal of the pot will not be used. Since we're on the back side of the circuit board, solder or crimp the lead of the 1N4007 diode to the lower end of the transistor case. THE DIODE BAND SHOULD FACE AWAY FROM THE TRANSISTOR. Solder or crimp 30 inches of 22 ga wire to the silver band end of the 1N4007 diode. Solder or crimp on 12 inches of 22 ga wire to the upper end of the transistor case. Route this wire through the perf board and back out again to the back to take up any strain on the wire when pulled. Attach a 12 inch length of 22 ga wire to the Emitter pin. This can also be routed in and out of the board to protect it from pull strain. The neon Ne-2 bulb acts as a safety device, protecting the transistor from high voltage spikes. The Ne-2 bulb should be attached to Emitter pin and to the Collector base. The bulb's leads are stiff enough to support the bulb by themselves. Next mount the circuit board to the wooden base. Use two short round head wood screws or machine screws. Drill out appropriate pilot holes in the perf board and attach it to the corner of the base on the same side as the four wires emerging from the driver coil (See photos). There should be four wire leads coming off the circuit board.The lead from the potentiometer's center terminal goes to the 24 gauge outside wire. Crimp a ring connector onto the 22 ga lead. Put a 8/32 nut over the bolt and tighten by hand.The lead from the upper end of the Collector base goes to the 20 gauge inside wire. Crimp a ring connector onto the 22 ga lead. Put a 8/32 nut over the bolt and tighten by hand. The lead from Emitter pin goes to the 24 gauge inside wire. Crimp a ring connector onto the 22 ga lead. Put it on the 8/32 bolt connected to the 24 gauge inside wire.  The fourth lead, from the 1N4007 diode, will be used as part of the charging system. Measure a length of 22 gauge wire about 30 inches long. Crimp a ring connector to one end, and put it on the same bolt as the 24 gauge inside wire. Put a 8/32 nut over the bolt and tighten by hand. Crimp a ring connector to a 30 inch length of hookup wire and put it on the 20 gauge outside post. When the circuit board is complete and all the connections made, there should be three long wires coming off the machine. Attach a 2 inch alligator clip to each wire. With strips of masking tape, make a label for each of the long wires, just behind the alligator clip.The wire from the 20 gauge outside post should be labeled \"C --\" meaning \" Charging Battery, Negative Pole.\" The wire from the 24 gauge inside post should be labeled \"PS --\" meaning \"Power Supply, Negative Pole.\" The wire from the 1N4007 diode should be labeled \"C+\" meaning \"Charging Battery, Positive Pole.\"", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FYL/FKST/HOUG853E/FYLFKSTHOUG853E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7W/Y04D/HOR811LN/F7WY04DHOR811LN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F74/95QL/HOR811LQ/F7495QLHOR811LQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9B/CWT1/HOR811LS/F9BCWT1HOR811LS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1Z/S5ZM/HOUG7QB8/F1ZS5ZMHOUG7QB8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F07/CQDB/HOR811N2/F07CQDBHOR811N2.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: The Circuit Board"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "The Bedini machine runs on direct current and outputs direct current. The simplest way to operate it is with two batteries of matching voltage/amperage. In the photos you see two six volt alkaline dry cells set up with the SSG. One battery provides power to the driver coil, while the other receives the high voltage impulses of the driver coil, recharging it. This machine also works well with 12 volt batteries, up to and including lead-acid car batteries. In fact, the SSG mechanism is best suited to lead-acid batteries, and is known to revitalize worn out, heavily sulphated batteries. I mostly have used it to recharge AA batteries. I have two battery clips from Radio Shack, one holding 4 AAs (6 volts) and another holding 8 AAs (12 volts). I have recharged many AA alkaline batteries, and even a high energy lithium AA. I've also ruined a few AAs too. Overcharged, the dry cells leak electrolyte and must be discarded. To hook up batteries to the SSG, you'll need a short jumper wire with alligator clips on both ends. The power battery has its + Positive lead connected to the -- Negative lead of the battery being charged via the jumper wire. Then connect the three leads from the Bedini machine as follows: The PS-- wire connects to the --Negative pole of the Power battery; the C+ connects to the +Positive pole of the Charging battery; and the C-- wire clips to the jumper wire, preferably near the --Negative post of the Charging battery. When everything is connected, turn the Potentiometer control to the lowest setting. Give the magnet wheel a modest push. As the pulses resonate in the driver coil, the wheel should \"catch\" and start spinning faster on its own. If it slows and stops, recheck all your connections and settings. Low voltage contacts can be finicky sometimes. Makes sure all the contacts are clean and firmly joined and try again. If you hear a slight hum or squeal coming from the driver coil, don't be alarmed. That's feedback, electrical resonance. Adjust the potentiometer until the sound goes away, and spin the wheel again. For steadier operation (and if you don't want to buy expensive batteries) you can use a DC power source in place of the Power battery. I've tried several kinds, from expensive DC lab supplies to rectified transformers. One of the best power sources turned out to be an old model train transformer, made by the Louis Marx Company. These variable transformers step down 110 volt AC wall current to 7 to 15 volts AC. These are not precision devices, though. Sometimes the voltage goes as low as 4 and as high as 20 V AC. You can rectify the train transformer output with a simple full-wave rectifier component. With a multimeter, check output voltages at various settings and mark the transformer case to show where 6 and 12 volt output occurs. Hookup the transformer just as you would the power battery, by connecting +Positive lead of the transformer by jumper wire to the --Negative post of the Charging battery, and PS-- clip from the SSG to the --Negative lead of the transformer.Update 2/4/2014:\u00a0I've been experimenting with other power sources for the SSG, and one of the simplest and best is an old \"wall wart\" plug-in adapter. I scrounged a number of these from thrift shops, all in the 4.5 -12 volts range, with power ratings from 300 mA to 2.1 amps. They all work, but they require some alteration and testing. First, the nominal voltage rating is not accurate. A so-called 6 volt transformer actually put out 7.5 volts; a 4.5 volt one put out 6. I guess this has to do with how the wall wart works under load, but be aware the SSG doesn't impose much strain on it, so you're likely to be getting more than the indicated voltage. Altering a wall wart is easy if the cord is the two wire kind. Cut off the plug and pull apart the insulated wires 3-4 inches. Strip the ends of the wires. You need to ID the positive and negative lines; if the wires aren't marked, test them with a digital multi-meter. (On most meters, connect the probes to the wires and plug the adapter in. If the readout on the meter shows negative, swap the leads. Mark the positive line in some way and crimp on connectors). Now use the wall wart as you would a battery, and connect it to the SSG in the same way--negative lead to the PS-- wire from the machine, and connect the positive lead to the negative post of the battery you are charging. If the adapter line is co-axial--that is, if one polarity of wire runs inside the other--you can still use the adapter. It takes more work. Solder length of bell wire to the inner and outer wires and proceed as described above. Interestingly, the wall warts don't seem to get hot powering the SSG. I've run them for hours and the adapter is barely warm. The charging batteries stay cool (sometimes even feel cold!) too.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FC2/T3AH/HOR811N9/FC2T3AHHOR811N9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWO/ODFH/HOR811NA/FWOODFHHOR811NA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1F/GFHY/HOR811NH/F1FGFHYHOR811NH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXW/E0DI/HOR811NL/FXWE0DIHOR811NL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE6/G6VM/HOR811NS/FE6G6VMHOR811NS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDQ/XEN9/HOR811NT/FDQXEN9HOR811NT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSI/3LVI/HOR811NV/FSI3LVIHOR811NV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJA/3HJG/HOR811NX/FJA3HJGHOR811NX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F97/PQ43/HOR811NW/F97PQ43HOR811NW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Power In, Power Out"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "The accessory induction coil and light are factory-made items I purchased online. They're made by a British firm, Reelight, for use on bicycles. Traditional bike lights use batteries or friction-powered generators for power, both of which have obvious drawbacks. The Reelight system does not impose any drag on the cyclist, and has no batteries to wear out. Stick some magnets on your bike rim, mount the coil, and as long as you pedal, you have a blinking safety light. To work efficiently, the induction coil should be mounted squarely close to the moving magnets. I made a simple mount of poplar wedge and a bit of lath at the proper angle to the wheel and mounted the Reelight coil with two nylon zip ties. Clearance between the coil and moving magnets is 1/8 inch. The red LED light has a mounting hole on the back. I put a short piece of bamboo skewer on top of one of the wheel supports and slipped the LED onto it. Now every time a magnet passes the coil, a pulse of electricity lights the LED.

I'm a self-taught hobbyist, so I'll tell you how I think the SSG works. The bifilar driver coil does several jobs at once; it triggers the transistor on and off, sends pulses of DC to the steel core electromagnet (pushing the the wheel along, North Pole vs. the C8 magnets' North Pole). It also acts as an induction coil when the magnets sweep past, triggering relatively high voltage pulses that are routed to the battery being charged. Most battery charging is done by trickle-charging modest, steady voltage into the battery. The Bedini SSG hammers the battery with short duration, high voltage spikes. This, as I understand it, is what allows the SSG to recharge \"unrechargeable\" batteries like alkaline dry cells or sulphated lead-acid cells. If you start your SSG going and the Ne-2 bulb flashes, something's wrong. The Ne-2 bulb is there to protect the transistor by absorbing high voltage spikes that should be going into the battery being charged. Check your connections again, particularly to the charging battery. It is possible to run the SSG without a Charging battery in place. The Ne-2 will flash the whole time. You're taking a chance of blowing the transistor, but it can be done. The wheel will probably run its fastest with the 5k pot turned all the way down to the lowest resistance, but the most efficient charging may occur at a slower RPM. You'll need to monitor input and output with multimeters to find the sweet spot best for charging. I tend to run mine flat out--it's more impressive that way. Whining coming from the SSG driver coil is feedback. You can diminish it by tuning with the pot. My wheel design has a free floating axle. I made it this way to facilitate changing the wheel for other experiments. Only once have I had a wheel come loose while turning. If you're concerned about the wheel flying off, you can anchor it by screwing an L bracket to the side of the poplar uprights, clamping the axle in place. Here's an SSG with a pendulum instead of a wheel. Notice it's the same frame as the one described here: Here's another video showing the SSG operating with a single permanent magnet instead of the elaborate wheel: That's how you turn magnetism into light.

Now solder a wire (I recommend flexible silicon wire) onto a button snap. Prepare three wires in total, one for each electrode. Sew those button snaps behind the lining with the conductive fabric patch - between lining and top layer. It is important using conductive thread to connect the electrodes with the wire and later on microcontroller. Then guide all three wires through the dress until coming out of the open spot in the waist seam behind the battery poach. To protect the wires a little more I put them in a little piece of leftover fabric tube right where I sewed over them to close the open waist seam.

There is the regular (5 watts & 1 amp) and now there is a \"Fast\" option (15 watts & 3 amps).  For Fast charging you need both a Fast receiver and transmitter.  I opted for the standard since I find that it is adequate for overnight charging and the battery on most phones will last the day under normal use.Operation and Considerations:Wireless charging is nothing but a split transformer, where one half transmits power via a high frequency magnetic field to the receiver side that then rectifies and smooths it  to 5 volts DC. Many phenomenon (like light) fall off in strength via a squared distance function (Strength / DxD). However, magnetic field strength is a cubed function (Strength / DxDxD).  What this means is that the power transfer capability drops off very fast.  Therefore, separation between the Transmitter and Receiver must be kept to a minimum, less than about 4 mm. Therefore, large fat and thick cases can make charging next to impossible unless you consider how to get the receiver closer to the transmitter.  Receivers built into a phone prevent the use of thick protective cases.  Also metal cases prevent the use of a receiver inside the case due to excessive currents in the case that use up the power and overheat the circuits. In my Galaxy S3, I used a thick case but got around it by taping the receiver to the outside of the phone back and removed the inner layer of the two piece case so that the separation was less than 4 mm.Note that charging receivers have a special magnetic shield on the back side.  This shield helps to keep the material behind the coils from interfering with the magnetic field and thus improving performance.  if you decide to expose the receiver coil, do not remove this shield. You also want to make sure the receiver is mounted face out.  The outside face will be marked in some way, perhaps as illustrated.On the charging receiver if the positive and negative terminals are not obvious or marked then you may have to place it on a charging pad and use your voltmeter to identify the positive and negative points to wire to.You can use most any transmitter since the new QI standard is backward compatible.  That is it will detect if your receiver is capable of fast charging and if not will not overload it.I chose a charging receiver that seemed reputable and I had seen evidence that when opened it had pretty copper wires. I wanted to see the insides, but additionally, removing the cover also gets the receiver coil closer to the transmitter coil.

You may not need to remove the motherboard as I did and as it turned out I didn't need to.  Be thinking ahead about how to  route the wires out of the phone.

Also the solder on the ground wire interfered with the cover, so I had to trim some material off of the inside of the cover at that location.  The end piece of the V20 is plastic (contains the antennae?) and all I had to do was add a couple of small notches for the wires.  I also added some clear packing tape to the metal back for insulation.  NOTE:  I was planning on laying the wires on top of the inner plastic and having some very thin copper bend over the metal back into the inside to contact with the wires.  However, I decided it would be easier to just attach the wires outside the phone.  But I had removed the insulation from the ends of the wires before changing my mind.

This is definitely the most important, but the hardest part to find out of all. Your options are to either 3d print the gears if you only have the motor. Or you could take apart toy cars, remote control cars, electronics toys with arms that move automatically etc.  The reason we need gears is to increase the number of times we can rotate the motor. With our bare hands we could make the motor rotate a few times before we get tired, but the gears help us rotate the motor more than 50 or 100 times with only rotation of our hand. So the gears are essential, since we want to rotate the motors as fast as possible without having to amputate or arms afterwards. 2) 4 General Purpose Diodes. Example : 1N4148. 3) 2 Supercapacitor of around 1 Farad or larger.  (The larger the capacity in Farads, the longer it will take to charge to bright light, but the charge will last for a longer time. So it's almost like buying a larger tank, it take more water to fill up a larger tank but more water can be stored in the larger tank.) Capacitors can be expensive, I bought the 1 F capacitors in a pack of 10 for 5 dollars, but that was from ebay. On most websites supercapacitors can go up to 2-5 bucks each, so check out for a good quality one at a reasonable price. Make sure the capacitance is in farads, not uF which are basically a million times smaller than a farad. 4) A switch.    Any switch works, as long as you don't go to fancy with all the TPDT or some relay type stuff. Simplicity is the key for switches, because well, switches are simple themselves. 5)A perfboard. You could use a breadboard to test out the circuit, but then again I was quite sure I would want to keep the circuit so I soldered it on a perfboard.  There are many variations, you could with veroboards, stripboards, surfboards and even the fancy \"Printed Circuit Boards\" if you have the resources to do so.  But I am a simple man, I see a simple circuit, I build it on a simple perfboard. 6) A White LED.      I tend to use white LED to look at dark rooms, but if you wish to run a disco with this, then feel free to throw in the multi colored LEDs as well.7) A piece (sheet) of hard plastic. 8) Plastic refill of a pen. 9) A few screws and nut bolts.   I am really unsure of their sizes, but I guess you could estimate or use any size as long as you change a few other measurements according to your needs.           Tools needed are: 1) Pliers. 2) Soldering iron 3) Hot glue gun 4) Scissors 5) Drill machine.

There is a power or current source,   there is a converter to convert the power into usable form, there is a section that stores the current, and then there is the load which uses the stored current.           In this circuit, the power source is going to be a motor. So how exactly can we use a motor to produce electricity?   The answer lies in Faraday's law of Induction which states, \"The induced electromotive force in any closed circuit is equal to the negative of the time rate of change of the magnetic flux enclosed by the circuit.\"  This law doesn't really help to understand much, so let me give you a simpler version of his words that relates to our circuit.     Basically when you have a change of magnetic field near a wire you produce electricity in the wire. The faster the change, the higher the voltage you produce. So you could move a magnet near a wire really fast and you will see some electricity being produced.     But the key word here is 'Some' electricity being produced.             So we have a few problems as of now:            1)You need a really tight and large coil of wire to rotate or move near a strong magnet to produce good amount of electricity.            2)Electricity produced by induction or  by moving magnet near a wire is A.C. or Alternating current.   Most household batteries or capacitors stores D.C. or Direct Current, which is exact opposite of A.C.  So we need to convert whatever electricity we make by induction from A.C. to D.C.            3)There are many options to choose from as to what we could use to store electricity. So we have to decide what to use.Solution to problem 1: So when you were a child, if you ever dreamed of being an engineer then you might have taken apart quite a few motors from toy cars. If you did so, and never managed to put them back together, you would know that motors have a round thingy in the middle and magnet on the side.  That round thingy in the middle is called the armature. It is made up of iron plates and many meters of copper wire tightly coiled around it.  So we met the solution to the first problem, we found something with wire and magnet, and the best part is that we could rotate the armature or the coil of wire really easily.Solution to problem 2: So A.C. electricity can be converted into DC electricity by various means. The wall adapters all have to convert AC to DC along with reducing the voltage. So if you take apart wall adapters of wide array of electronics, you will somehow always manage to find four diodes placed side by side. So the solution to our problems would be the rectifier circuit! The rectifier circuit is basically 4 diodes connected together. Also it is very cheap, and easy to make.   We could go all fancy by adding capacitors to smooth out the output spikes, but for our simple circuit why bother?Solution to problem 3: So have you ever used capacitors in circuits? No? Well capacitors can store electricity, and guess what, they can charge up much faster than most batteries! And they make the circuit look somewhat fancy, so we can't go wrong with that.

You don't really need to know how a motor works to make this circuit. But still it doesn't bother me much to tell a little. The motor has coils of wires and magnets. When electricity is flowed into the coil of the motor, the coil produces a magnetic field which repulses the magnet's magnetic field. If you ever played with magnets, you know opposite ends attract and same ends repel.  Well that same repulsion and attraction is used to pull and push the armature and make the motor move.       On the schematic the motor is mention as 'M' in a box.     Also the polarity of the motor doesn't matter much in this circuit.         Diodes: The symbol of the diode looks like an arrow being blocked by a wall. That exactly what the diode does infact. It lets electricity flow in the direction of the arrow, but stops it from flowing backwards, in terms of conventional current.      You  don't need to know what conventional current is, except for the fact that our ancestors in electrical fields screwed up in theory of which direction electricity flows.      Anyway, on the diode the end with the stripe is the negative end.           LED: Light Emitting Diodes are basic diodes that produce light when electricity is flowed through them. So the symbol is basically a diode with two arrows pointing outwards (shows flow of light). The longer lead is the positive.          Capacitors: Most capacitors have a longer lead that is positive. The symbol of a capacitor is just two lines placed side by side, the curved line is the negative end.  Oh, the symbol of the capacitor also shows what the capacitor is basically. The capacitor is just two conductive plates separated by a insulator. A capacitor can store electricity in those plates, just like a battery. But the problem lies in the capacitance and the breakdown voltage. A capacitor can hold more electricity if the insulation is thinner. The capacity to store electricity is measured in Farads. But if the insulation is thinner, the insulation can easily break down if the pressure of electrons is too much (Voltage). So we have to make sure we do not exceed the voltage limit for the capacitors.     The capacitor I am using is a 1 Farad capacitor with a Breakdown voltage of 5 Volt. My motor can produce about 7-9 volts when rotated at full speed with the gear, so it will easily breakdown the insulation of the capacitor. The solution is to use capacitors in series. So basically we will connect the positive of one capacitor of one capacitor to the negative of the other capacitor. Then the breakdown voltage will add up, and it will become 10 volts! So problem solved! Let's get started already!!!!!But before we get moving,  in the next few steps we will be creating the mechanical aspects of the circuit, like the hand crank and base etc. So we will get back to the circuits down the way later on.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWO/RPUI/ITCHKRLN/FWORPUIITCHKRLN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQP/7GNF/ITCHKRMU/FQP7GNFITCHKRMU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEO/J820/ITCHKRRS/FEOJ820ITCHKRRS.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: So Let's Introduce Ourselves With the Components!"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "          We are going to mount the perfboard onto the motor, so the circuit and the power source stays together, forever and after.

Problem 1:  MY CIRCUIT DOESN\"T WORK YOU LIAR! YOUR ENTIRE LIFE IS A LIE!          Solution: Calm down because I don't have either the patience or the sadistic nature in me to make someone waste hours of their youth to make a fake circuit. Let's slow down and get along with the rest of the problems.   ( This happened to me countless times on youtube, people blaming me for their circuit not working.)          Problem 2: The Circuit doesn't work, would you help me fix it?          Solution: Now this is a better way to express your opinions and needs. Alright the circuit may not be working due to several reason.           Did you make your connections properly according to the schematic? Check it. If the connections are right, check whether you made soldering bridges. (accidentally connecting more than one connection by solder overflow).             Did you insert the capacitor of proper polarity?  Check with a multimeter to see the continuity of each capacitor, if there is continuity between the poles of one of the capacitors, then that capacitor needs to be replace, since the capacitor broke down upon reaching the Breaking Voltage.          Is the motor big enough for the purpose? Most small motors tend not to work, since they produce less electricity due to their lesser amount of coils.         Problem 3: The light doesn't stay lit for long or the light is too dim!          Solution: Is the capacitor's value over 1 Farad?  The lower the farad rating, the less the charge it can hold.         Are there shorts in the bottom of the circuit? That could be leaking excess energy from the circuit.         Also choose a bigger LED to make it brighter. The motor can be switch for a bigger motor for higher voltage output and also brighter light.         Problem 4: My light keeps flickering, and works only when I rotate the motor!

Look at the pictures if you are unsure. You will also need to reinforce the thin traces of the verroboard/stripboard by soldering a piece of bare copper wire across both sides of the base (one copper wire across the negative and one across the positive side). Look at the pictures for more info. Without this the thin traces of the stripboard would blow/melt when you discharge the bank becuase of the high peak currents. Solder some wires to one end of the board too, make them around 10cm long and thick (mains flex wire is fine). This is so you can conned the bank to the charger and discharge stick. There are several images here to help you.Wires need to be relatively thick in order to reduce the power lost in the wires. You can use several lengths of thinner wire in parallel if you do not have any thick wire. I used some mains flex in parallel on mine.What if I have lots of different value capacitors? can they still be used together? The answer to this is yes. You can safely mix different value capacitors as their added capacitance will add up. For example, if you have two 80uF capacitors and three 120uF capacitors then they will all add up to make 520uF.What about the maximum voltage rating? Since we are putting them in parallel, the maximum voltage rating of the whole capacitor bank is the same as the capacitor with the lowest voltage rating. So if you had some capacitors in the bank that are rated for 330v and some rated for 350v, the maximum voltage you could use the bank would be 330v. However you do not need to worry about this since we are using the charger that was included with the camera. This is only needed to be taken into consideration if you using a separate charger.

Pressing the contact lever made energy, as you can see in the video. A bit later I placed a strong neodymium magnet on the contact lever of the relay. As a result, the voltage was peaking 2 times higher on the screen. Then I took a small relay; the output peak voltage of the relay coil was 35 volt, without load. After the bridge rectifier the voltage peaks are smoothed by a condenser. To test the small generator I use an ultra bright LED. Take care; depending on the iron of the relay coil a stronger magnet will not give more flux, this because of the saturation. If you make the gap bigger between the contact lever and the relay coil the output will enhance. The magnet functions also as tension spring. The lever jumps back after pressing.

Hopefully you have some basic tools such as pliers, wire cutters, duct tape, something to put holes in things (drill, leather punch, or scissors if you have nothing else), a hammer, and a wallet if you need it.Edit: I have found that the electricity in the glove does not really want to sit still for too long and the longer you leave the glove on, the greater the risk of shock. It really is not that bad of a shock on your hand if it does shock you, but to avoid it, don't have the glove on for longer than about 15 seconds max(quite a long time really.) unless you are shocking something. If you are shocking something then you should be alright.Disclaimer: You should only use this for self defense purposes and not for offensive acts. Don't be that guy everyone hates because he electrocutes everybody and thinks it is funny and has no friends. Especially don't use it on friendly animals like pets, that's just messed up. I am not responsible for vigilante use either (you know its awesome, but still illegal). You can test it on yourself just to see if it works if you want to though...

(I recommend this model from Vipertek advertised as 15 million volts, it is a great size to work with and very powerful, if you get a larger one it my be harder to work with.) It just looks like a little box. You can get it on Ebay for $12.99 free shipping. That's what I got it for at least. This is the model these instructions are for. If you don't get it, you will be on your own when it comes to connecting glove to taser.2. A sports glove or utility glove (this is a top glove for the electrical hookups) I got mine at Home Depot for a little over $10 if I remember correctly. I like this brand because it has a simple style and no uncomfortable plastic knuckles. DO NOT GET A TIGHT FITTING PAIR. Get one that has some room for a thinner glove to go underneath and some wiring. EDIT: No seriously guys get a large glove that you can insulate with a rubber dish glove or lots of padding, you may want to add extra if you need to.3. A thin material glove that goes over your arm and almost to your elbow. This is just for holding the taser to your arm. I got these skeleton costume gloves at Zurchers for $5. I guess I sort of liked the idea of it looking like a skeleton too, but it is mostly covered up by the top glove anyway.4. Metal rivets. These are for the electrodes. I used regular flat rivets so that I could use my hand for other things while it is turned off without a bunch of spike rivets poking everything I touch. (and I don't like the look of spike rivets, though they make sense for poking through clothing a bit better) You can get these at just about any leather store.5. Thin wire. (About 5 feet. 6 feet is a safe bet) Insulated copper for best results. It does not have to be thick at all, if you unscrew the electrodes at the top of the taser, you will see the wire that carries all this electricity is surprisingly thin. Thinner wire means less hand irritation. I could not find this in any common convenience store though I did not try Radio Shack. I got mine by taking some that hung off the back of my radio and some headphone cords.6. Some basic tools like pliers, something to punch some different size holes (leather punch or drill will work), scissors, a hammer and rivet anvil for setting those rivets,  soldering items ( optional because I made this glove without soldering which may have some negative effects that I don't know about), utility razor, wire strippers, and paper (totally used this). I also used a little bit of super glue.7. Electrical tape and duct tape. I thought online was my best bet to cut cost so I spent $2 on a roll of electrical tape, then face-palmed myself when I walked by it at Wal-Mart for 58 cents... Doubt you could find a better price anywhere else. Duct tape is your crafting friend, always have some on hand.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F9D/Q7BX/I1KJNEBO/F9DQ7BXI1KJNEBO.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: What You Will Need"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Just think about where you want the rivets on your outside glove, mark it, then put holes where you want them, just big enough for the rivet to fit through. My leather punch worked very well on fabric as well as the rubber covered places surprisingly. You probably guessed to put 2 or 3 on each finger (I did 2 because 3 would be cramping my movement and I imagine the electricity has to travel further with less rivets) but you may want to consider adding 2 to the palm (what I did). If you want to go a little crazy with it you could try the back of your hand or knuckles, but I did not because I thought it would be over-the-top a bit. Once you get the hang of wiring them, you can put them anywhere you fancy.Now  that you know how many rivets you need and where they go, it would be a good time to prep your rivets. By that I just mean cut them to size. I don't know if you can find them where the bottom rivet is  just a little under 1/4 of an inch tall, so you can just cut them with some cable cutters or your leatherman or any other plier/utility knife with the wire cutting wedges on them. After cutting them, you have to use the pliers to squeeze the sides back open because they will be flat and pointy at the edges and completely unable to fit into the top section anymore. Just make it able to fit back in and you should be good. Now you know what to do if your rivets aren't the right size for your future projects as well. The second picture shows a rivet with the top pinched together after being freshly cut, the next one over has been opened back up with the plier part of my tool (also use this to cut them), then the furthest to the right is the top of a rivet. Some people may be unfamiliar with rivets, like me two years ago, that is why I added this picture.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FXX/802F/I1KJNEBQ/FXX802FI1KJNEBQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F66/OVR3/I1NUK89V/F66OVR3I1NUK89V.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Rivet Holes"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "This can be done in a ton of different ways that are most likely better than mine, so if you have a better idea or preference, do it your way.I started by putting the taser.... hold on, here is a very helpful hint if you did not already have it covered:HINT: Run your taser dry. You don't want to accidentally zap yourself while working on it. If your taser has an LED light built onto it like my good model, just turn it to that and leave it on overnight or a ton of hours. If somehow it does not have a light, the best of luck to you. I do recommend you do leave just enough power in it to have the little red light that tells you it is armed light up. Just press the button and make sure no electricity jumps the gap so you don't get a nasty shock.I would first start by doing something about that button on the side of it you have to press to get your taser to shock. No one wants to hold that button down constantly to have your glove work. Do something to it that makes it constantly and permanently pressed down. I put the top of a rivet on the button and covered it with tape (duct tape does not stretch like electrical so use that). You can tell if it works because when you switch it on the red light will not shine because the button is being pressed down. If it shines, you need to redo it because it is not working. Then just keep the switch on the off position for maximum safety.I then shoved it under the glove on the bottom of my arm and positioned it where I wanted it. Then I cut a slit just at the top of the taser so it could poke through. Then I used duct tape and electrical tape to wrap around and under it through some more holes I cut on the sides to keep it in place. You can keep the switch covered if the fabric is stretchy enough to move the switch or have it exposed through a carefully cut hole. I say carefully because stretchy material is unforgiving of mistakes and holes that are cut when it is relaxed are much different that holes cut when it is tight. Be super careful or you may have to get a new glove, or like me stitch up a big hole (maybe you can see in the pic, just on the side of the taser near the switch). Anyway, be creative and do it better because I feel like mine is pretty bad. You just need the electrodes exposed. And the light because why let that be covered up and go to waste?By the way, it was getting tight inside my glove, so you may notice in one of the pictures (picture #4) I cut off all the fingers and most of the hand ON THE UNDER GLOVE, but left the part between the thumb and index finger in tact to hold the wrist brace up still. If your glove is a little big on you and has some extra room, feel free to keep the top of the under glove in tact. DO NOT CUT UP YOUR TOP GLOVE.The last picture is it just charging. I just pull the sleeve down a little and plug it in.TIP: Make sure the taser is in a position that allows free wrist movement.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F9X/4RVK/I1KJNEC5/F9X4RVKI1KJNEC5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOA/OMC7/I1KJNEBR/FOAOMC7I1KJNEBR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW3/2TNB/I1KJNEBS/FW32TNBI1KJNEBS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYS/PUUT/I1KJNEC6/FYSPUUTI1KJNEC6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F87/21R7/I1KJNEBW/F8721R7I1KJNEBW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPM/QQ23/I1NUK3YN/FPMQQ23I1NUK3YN.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Mount the Taser to Your Wrist"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Here is the most time consuming and crucial part. I recommend you read the entire page before starting so that you are not trying to follow along line-by-line and mess up. It is simple if you understand what you are doing.A NOTE ON POLARITY (IMPORTANT): The two nodes on your taser have either a positive or a negative polarity to them, like a battery. When you wire your fingers, alternate the polarity for each finger. Ex: thumb(positive), index(negative), middle(positive), ring finger(negative), pinky(positive). You do this by alternating which electrodes you attach each fingers wiring to, see second to last picture for reference. I put notes on each section to make it a bit more understandable. I honestly did not take apart my taser to find out which one is positive and which is negative, I just alternated which ones I attached the wires to and it works just fine.Expose the end of your copper wire (first picture). Wire strippers are your best friend for this job. A little over a half an inch at the end will do the trick, just enough to wrap around the base of your rivet and twist a little bit around itself so that it does not come off, like you would a twisty tie on a bag of bread (second picture). If you are a solder guy, you can solder the wire straight to the base, but do not make it bulky because you still have to pound that rivet down. I did not use solder so don't worry about it if you do not want to solder (again it worked out just fine). YOU DO NOT WANT ANY COPPER WIRE EXTENDING PAST THE EDGE OF THE RIVET. Exposed wire is an electrical hazard. If there is any, just trim the excess.The third picture is of me punching a hole in squares of electrical tape stacked on top of each other. I use these to put between the glove fabric and the rivet, as you can see in picture four. I only did this because I did not entirely trust the fabric to repel (more like prevent the flow) electricity as well as the tape. I do think it helps the rivet stay in better though. Put a layer (one of those squares) of electrical tape on the inside and outside of the glove, sandwich it on both sides of the glove between the rivet, sticky side to the glove obviously (note pictures four and five for that). Once you have the exposed wire wrapped around the base of your rivet, turn the glove inside out and put the bottom of the rivet through the hole AT THE END of a finger (does not matter which one at this point, because you will wire each finger separately but I started with my thumb). You want to always work from the end of a finger to the opening. Then manage to turn the finger back outside-right (if that is a real term) while keeping the bottom part of the rivet poking through the hole to the outside. Then put the top part of the rivet on. I put the rivet anvil (the round metal piece that actually came with a pack of snaps I had, so technically it is a snap-setting anvil) inside the finger underneath the rivet, then hammer the rivet down tight. If you are unfamiliar with rivets and have no snap setting anvil, you might be able to just press the finger of the glove flat against a stone slab or something and hammer it down the best you can, though it may cause some damage to the back of the glove finger if you aren't careful. Anyway, it should look like picture four and picture five when you have it set nice and tight.TIP: Be careful not to damage or sever the wire while pounding the rivets down.Now move to the second hole below the one you just did on the tip of the finger. Hold the wire next to the hole and where the hole lands on the wire, start removing the insulation there. Remove a little under a half an inch below the hole, exactly like picture four. This part requires much care because it is not as easy as stripping the end of your wire. I used a utility razor to carefully peel away the insulation. Be super careful that you do not sever the wire or you will have to redo the entire finger or splice the wire back together and splicing is sketchy. You want to wrap this once around the bottom of a rivet and continue to the other side without copper wire extending past the edge of the rivet (picture six). Then set the rivet the same way as the first one. Make sure the wire is going in the direction you want (towards the opening of the glove at the wrist, or to the next hole. Don't forget the tape.Continue wiring like this and once you get to the end of each finger, lead the wire down and out the opening of the glove with 2 or 3 inches to spare hanging out, You should have enough length to reach your taser, so if it is not right there on your wrist like mine, just have enough to make it to the electrodes of your taser. ALWAYS HAVE A LITTLE MORE LENGTH THAN IS NEEDED TO GET TO THE ELECTRODES OF YOUR TASER! YOU DONT WANT TO FIND OUT YOU CUT IT TOO SHORT BECAUSE TAKING RIVETS OUT IS A PAIN AND YOU DO NOT WANT TO HAVE TO REWIRE AN ENTIRE FINGER! If you have electrodes on your palm like mine, have them be a different polarity by connecting the wire from the index finger and pinky, or two fingers that you know will have different polarity.The second to last picture shows the finished wiring on the inside, the last shows the electrodes on the outside. That is what it should look like.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FIA/C5WU/I1MQ72BA/FIAC5WUI1MQ72BA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPE/VN0L/I1MQ72B8/FPEVN0LI1MQ72B8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW6/ED22/I1KJNECA/FW6ED22I1KJNECA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGS/KDCC/I1KJNECB/FGSKDCCI1KJNECB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL6/OM7E/I1KJNECC/FL6OM7EI1KJNECC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPZ/87Q9/I1KJNEDV/FPZ87Q9I1KJNEDV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWJ/9XYJ/I1MQ72BD/FWJ9XYJI1MQ72BD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLG/OGG6/I1MQ72BC/FLGOGG6I1MQ72BC.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Wire the Outside Glove"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Time to make sure the electricity stays away from your hand.First, put a square of electrical tape to cover the exposed back of the rivet (this is all the inside of the glove). This is before the first picture, so don't be confused. Just one layer.For the second layer, cut small circles out of paper (just regular printer paper is what I used) that are just big enough to cover the rivet (which is hidden under one layer of electrical tape now). See the first picture, where I lay the paper circles over all the rivet areas for reference. Three circles on each one, so there is three layers of paper (four if you are extra cautious). Then cover that up with three more squares of electrical tape (second picture). In total that is one electrical tape layer on the bottom, three paper, then three more electrical tape layers. Why paper? I read on Wikipedia that paper is non conductive and I agreed with it. I did not want to bet it all on just electrical tape to keep the electricity away from me. Paper is readily available to everyone and is flexible.Put two more circles of paper ,then three more layers of electrical tape over the already layered pieces from the paragraph above for extra safe insulation thickness. (Edited in after I felt the electricity was too close to my fingers for comfort. This thickness keeps it away from me at full charge.).NOTE: You probably have realized by now that electrical tape has disappointing adhesive properties when it comes to fabric (it doesn't stick too well). Don't worry about it, it will be fixed after the next paragraph...Trim all the tape corners to reduce the bulky square size of these \"resistor pads\" as I like to call them. You don't need them to be these huge ugly peeling squares so cut them into rounder shapes, but be sure that it covers the rivet completely with a good amount of overlap to be safe. See picture three.Now these resistor pads are better shapes, but still not sticky or durable, cover the entire pad in a layer of duct tape that sticks it to the glove. Duct tape sticks very well to fabric and will hold it in there nicely and your hand will not peel the duct tape as easily as electrical tape when you shove it in. See picture four. You can trim a few corners off the duct tape to keep it away from the seams, but don't over do it. You want those resistor pads in there solid.By the way, now is a good time to trim the electrical tape around the rivets on the outside of the glove. Trim it close as you can get it, it just looks bad on the outside. See picture five.NOTE: You can test your insulation by using a screwdriver (plastic or wood handle) and touching it to the insulation pads (your glove being inside out) while your glove is on with a considerable amount of power, if not fully charged. If any electricity jumps (it wont) then it is done wrong. You could also touch each pad with your finger (on a low charge, like 15 minutes, just enough charge to hear the electric whine) then put your entire hand on all of them at the same time. If you feel any electricity, fix it.NOTE: You may have noticed one of the wires on my glove (ring finger) is a little bit funky, but that is because it was a thinly insulated wire that I found inside another wire, so it was white. I encased it in a little bit of electrical tape for better insulation. If you have enough of the same wire to do the entire glove, yours will just look like all the other wires, so don't freak out when you see my \"special wire\" just because it looks different.EDITED NOTE: After charging this thing for over an hour, I put it on to discover my hand gets a funky, semi-electrical feel to it. Also, it felt like a small bubbling sensation under the insulation pads on the rivets. I figured that this is a combination of the entire glove carrying the electricity and my insulation pads were a bit too thin (I only used two layers of paper and two electrical tape layers on top of that, which is why I edited it to say three paper layers and three electrical tape layers. This may in fact be the only reason my hand felt some electricity). If this happens to you, just add some more insulation. A few extra layers of electrical tape might do the trick, or maybe you could add some more layers of paper. Just make sure that it is secured down by duct tape as the final layer. I am pretty sure your hand will always feel a little funny while the glove is on due to the whole thing basically carrying a ton of electricity. It may be unavoidable like the noise it makes while it turns on. If you have all the insulation layers from the instructions above, you will still be able to feel a little bubbling underneath the pads, but there is no way the electricity will jump through those pads.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2Z/KO95/I1NUJN3C/F2ZKO95I1NUJN3C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9Y/BKG4/I1NUJN3D/F9YBKG4I1NUJN3D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF4/QDTV/I1NUJN3S/FF4QDTVI1NUJN3S.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO0/9E7O/I1NUJN3T/FO09E7OI1NUJN3T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8L/SX8K/I1NUJN3E/F8LSX8KI1NUJN3E.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Insulate the Inside of Your Glove"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "This part can be a little tricky, but not too much. Strip the ends of all the wires coming out of your glove, about half an inch will do. See picture one.Twist the wires from the thumb, middle, and pinky finger together at the ends. Then twist the other two wires together at the ends to keep them grouped. This is all with the glove right side out. See second picture.Now you want to take off one of the nodes on your taser. Just twist the node on the end with some pliers counterclockwise to unscrew it. That is just for this model, I have another model that has no plate and it does not unscrew, so If you have a different model than the little 15 mil volt Vipertek box-looking one, your on your own for wiring. See picture three. I have the pointy ends bent up and over already in the picture, but I had to bend them back to unscrew and wire, so do not bend them back until after you have wired the glove to the taser.You are going to wire the bundle of three wires to one node, the bundle of two to the other. Anyway, The little knob should come out and the plate with the pointy side will come off too. you will notice a little red wire (there is a little wire on both sides that come up to touch the metal plate to carry the electricity). This is the important part of the whole thing, you need to have your copper wires touching the end of this. You can fray the end of the wire bundle a little bit to have it lay a little flatter and cover more area on this plate area. See picture four. You need to screw the plate back on top while your wire is underneath it, of course with minimal copper wire sticking out from under the plate. If you are having a hard time keeping the wire in place and screwing the plate back on, I used just a little dot of Krazy glue (just super glue, different brand) at the end of the frayed wire to stick it to the plastic a little bit. DO NOT USE SUPER GLUE ON YOUR WIRE CLOSE TO THE LITTLE RED WIRE AS IT MAY GET BETWEEN THE WIRES AND PREVENT A GOOD CONNECTION.I have both the sides done in the fifth picture and bent the pointy edges back up and over the little node so that the electricity was not tempted to ever jump that gap again. I used a little super glue on the little screw-node to keep it stuck where it was with the plate tight down on those wires. Also around the plate just to keep it real solid in place. Afterwards I simply covered those nodes the best I could with electric tape (4 or 5 layers on mine) and a little bit up the wires too. See last picture. Electrical tape still has a hard time sticking to these things, so you can use duct tape over your electrical tape to really keep things stuck. IF YOU LIKE THE LED LIGHT ON YOUR TASER  DON'T COVER IT UP WITH TAPE. I think it is cool on your wrist.NOTE: Using super glue on these metal nodes and wires has an interesting effect. When you finally turn your taser on (and it has some decent charge to it), you will hear a faint sizzling... I panicked a bit and would not put it on my hand until I knew what was making that sizzle noise. I figured out it was the super glue down there on those nodes, so don't worry about it if that is what is sizzling.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F85/A65Q/I1NUJN3G/F85A65QI1NUJN3G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZL/D1RY/I1NUJN3J/FZLD1RYI1NUJN3J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5Z/E6B1/I1NUJN3K/F5ZE6B1I1NUJN3K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6R/UZ9A/I1NUJN3L/F6RUZ9AI1NUJN3L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI5/1J2Q/I1NUJN3M/FI51J2QI1NUJN3M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTJ/DM6S/I1NUJN3P/FTJDM6SI1NUJN3P.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Wire the Glove to Your Taser"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "This just means if you need to attach the top glove to the bottom one in some way to make it easier to get on and off, do that. I have no pictures of me doing this though you may notice on my final product. The picture is explained in the first note.I used a few rivets around the wrist to attach what little was left of my under-glove to the top glove. My fingers are right against the duct tape on the inside, but if you have all the fingers on your under-glove then find a way to try to keep the under glove inside the top one so it is easy to pull off and put on. Maybe some hand sewing or tape if you are lazy, or you could try rivets.Every time you take your glove off or put it on, you want to take extra care to put as little strain on the wires as possible, fixing things would be a pain.Add some designs to make it cooler if you want.SOME NOTES FOR USING THIS TASER HAND:NOTE: When first trying it out, you want to only charge it for maybe four or five minutes so that if there is a problem, you will only get a very tiny shock. I had a small amount of a rivet poking through after a mistake I made and failed to correct it. It was directly touching my skin and it gave me the smallest shock so that I knew where it was and corrected it by covering it back up. I barely felt it, and I am a guy who is super paranoid about shocks. This happened because I tried to tighten a rivet by pounding it down with my hammer AFTER I put the resistor pad on the back, so it just poked straight through. (picture)NOTE: When you turn on the glove, you will hear some unsettling electric whine coming from it (when it has a considerable or full charge). This is normal and will just continue until you touch something, making a sparky noise on metal or be quiet if it is on skin or other non-metal surfaces.NOTE: I would not dare make a fist with this thing turned on, I don't trust throwing a punch while it is turned on either, I bet you would get shocked, but if I'm wrong, good for you risk-takers. Who am I kidding? Putting this glove on your hand and turning it on takes a ton of courage. You are taking a risk just having this thing near you because it is a death trap that you voluntarily attach to your hand, complete with amateur electrical wiring and warranty-voiding alterations. But who cares because it is super cool.NOTE: You can always run the battery dry if you do not want it charged up, just leave the LED light on.NOTE: You always want to fix any insulation or wire problems while you are finding them out at low voltage.

So sorry in advance for my bad English and guide me if I have any error as I haven't proof read this instructable. This DIY guide is for making perpetual motion swinging stick. This is one kind of pendulum, which uses a very low amount of energy for continuous motion. This instructable is for DIYers, which do not have expensive tools and willing to make something good by hand work. You need to have some knowledge of hacksaw plate cutting, use of soldering, abrasive paper etc. Voila, you know these things! Then you absolutely gonna love to create this.Check out this video of Chaos Swinging sticks working...Working VideoLet me first introduce you with some basic conception and details.The swinging stick is a sophisticated museum-grade sculpture that appears to effortlessly defy the laws of physics and gravity. Watch as the silent, hypnotic motion of the arms entrances and removes you from all distractions.Featured in Hollywood blockbusterThe movie as Iron Man 2 and in museums, hotels, offices and shops all around the world, the Swinging Sticks is the must have product for the design conscious consumer.The Swinging Sticks was created in 1996 by two Germans who spent years perfecting the engineering and mechanics.The chaos stick(The name I loved the most) is based on the chaos theory, the branch of mathematics that deals with complex systems whose behavior is highly sensitive to slight changes in conditions so that small alterations can give rise to strikingly great consequences. Here, the same thing will happen, a slight change in the air affects the stick and hence change its movement. To bring continuous motion electrical energy is used. By providing potential energy to the coil for the movement against gravity stick can run for longer time. The ideal time for Battery cell is around 3 months. For reducing this life we can eliminate LED bulb and extend battery life about further 1 month. The model that I am going to produce is a kinematic sculpture, which runs on negligible electromotive force provided by electrical energy to run against gravitational force. So now let's begin the building of Chaos Swinging sticks or whatever you want to call it....First things first...This swinging stick is considered as very precious and expensive as it is patented by  www.theswingingsticks.com( Check yourself, it is almost same product except for hanging portion) So at starting stage of this project, I didn't even know how to give it motion but after a lot of searches, I finally found the way to give it oscillating motion and after that cost for building these would be around $4 (\u20b9250)Things to collect or buy for structure:(From hardware store and your store room)1a.Wooden sheet from scrap or buy one (Thickness of sheet needs to be around 5mm.) around 30x30Cm1b.Sunmica for better look as well as saving time(optional) 20x20Cm2.

Remember size does not matter here (Take larger then 3.8Cm) as we will throw this out after making the coil. But the bigger you make the more trouble you will have while winding by hand.3.Take the middle of paper by crossing each opposite side and make a hole of around 4mm( take the size of the tube diameter) by using scissors or thread cutter.4.Put tube inside the hole and each paper on each mark.5.Cut the paper tape in 1cm width and around 6cm length.( The inside diameter should be around 6mm after sticking paper tape, so the length of paper tape depends upon the tube diameter you have) Stick the tape around tube in-between the papers.6.Put the end of the wire from inside to the outside of the paper as shown in a picture.Use Fevikwik to make proper joint do not leave space between paper and tape. You may need to make the small hole to bring coil wire outside from core. Do not hesitate if you need to do that. Remember not to use more Fevikwik as we are going to make the temporary joint.7.Make 38mm Diameter, which we have to fill using wire. Start taking the turn by hand or by any small dc motor, if you have but for dc motor you will need to handle the coil by the motor and it needs proper arrangements.8.It will take around 15min. If you do it by hand. Try to put the wire in sequence, so coil will fill equally in length.9.Use varnish or Fevikwik to make coils every turn stronger. Use Fevikwik or varnish after some layer of wire, so the wire can not jump out when we try to remove plastic paper. For varnish, you have to wait 3 to 4 days for drying coil. That's why I prefer Fevikwik.Yes, you can use Fevikwik for making coil stronger.10.If you have taken 50Gms wire than the wind all wire, otherwise remember that 38mm limit. Overall around 780 to 900 turn of wire is enough to create 8 to 10 Ohm resistance.11.Take two wires end of the coil and remove coating by abrasive paper or burning it. In the burning method, you may over burn it so I would prefer abrasive paper method.12.>If you have Multimeter then measure the resistance of the coil and check contact to wire if it is working or not.(Resistance should be near to 9 Ohm)>If you don't have Multimeter don't we have another trick to check if coil it working or not. Take the magnet, put it over the coil and directly connect coil wires to 3Volt battery anode(-)and cathode(+).(1.5V x 2)(Side of wire doesn't matter here.)If magnetic flux generated in the coil, then you can fill it by trying to hover the magnet over the coil.13.So seems like coil worked for you.Now time to remove plastic paper and fully unleash coil. Try to remove opposite side cover where no wire is coming out of the coil. prefer to do it by hand or by another piece of hard plastic paper. Be Careful with core wire, which is coming outside from the core. Do not break it.(We need coil extremely near to magnet to utilize energy more efficiently. So, cut extra portion of the tube by hot knife or by hacksaw.Voila, the coil is ready to use.Now let's make Swinging sticks", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FM8/KD5B/IYAN5PJZ/FM8KD5BIYAN5PJZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0Z/APAF/IYAN5PK8/F0ZAPAFIYAN5PK8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4G/O68D/IYAN5PKF/F4GO68DIYAN5PKF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXO/16ML/IYAN5PKL/FXO16MLIYAN5PKL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2I/OH93/IYAN5PL4/F2IOH93IYAN5PL4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F35/PQZX/IYAN5PL9/F35PQZXIYAN5PL9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ6/3E9K/IYAN5PLH/FZ63E9KIYAN5PLH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXP/9PMJ/IYAN5PLN/FXP9PMJIYAN5PLN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F67/I8M1/IYAN5PLQ/F67I8M1IYAN5PLQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRN/3Q6W/IYAN5PLX/FRN3Q6WIYAN5PLX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSM/E78I/IYAN5PMB/FSME78IIYAN5PMB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDR/WWSI/IYAN5PMF/FDRWWSIIYAN5PMF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0S/ZBDX/IYAN5PMJ/F0SZBDXIYAN5PMJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRK/7GUM/IYAN5PMV/FRK7GUMIYAN5PMV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG1/692L/IYAN5PNX/FG1692LIYAN5PNX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMK/2AVC/IYAN5PO6/FMK2AVCIYAN5PO6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0G/FLVI/IYAN5POE/F0GFLVIIYAN5POE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6J/MANI/IYAN5PON/F6JMANIIYAN5PON.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNB/8BQ0/IYAN5POP/FNB8BQ0IYAN5POP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: The Making of the Coil"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Things and tools needed for this step:Aluminum tube 9mmSteel rod 2 to 3 mm(I have taken one from my bicycle) (spoke)Use and throw penBearing 693zz 2pieceRefill (which fits into bearing and out of rod)(optional)Araldite(Use toothpick or compass for holding Araldite compound)Pliersscalepermanent markerFevikwikHacksaw PlateThread cutterNeedle(Last step)Wire cutter(Last step)1.Cut Aluminium tube in 17.2 to 18cm (16cm+1.2to2cm) to make base Column.

They are cheap, sturdy, safe and can in be used in all those projects, where space and weight is not an issue. They can hold ample amount of charge and can be used again and again by recharging. But what if you don't own a balance charger to recharge your battery or coincidently, gave it to one of your friends for few days. No worries! You can make one yourself using very nominal parts and then charge your 4V batteries.What you need is, a general purpose diode or a silicon diode and a 5V power supply. For instance, you can use a 1N4007 diode. Simple put it in series with the battery and connect it to your 5V power supply. Negative of the diode will be connected to positive of the battery. Silicon diodes have a breakdown voltage of 0.7V so they will reduce the 5 volts output of the power supply to 4.3V, which is exactly equal to the maximum voltage to which, a 4V lead acid battery should be charged.Talking about the power supply, you can use a mobile phone charger or can use a 7805 voltage regulator along with a 9V or 12V power supply. A simple schematic of such and arrangement is given above in the pictures. I would refer you to use the \"voltage regulator method\", because lead acid battery do not start charging instantly but take some time and tends to increase the current intake slowly as their terminal voltage increase and some mobile phone charger these days, have auto cutoff feature which automatically cuts off the power if a wholesome amount of current is not being drawn from them in the initial charging phase.

But as we evolve with time, we all experiment with different types of power supply to chose the best suited source for our project. We try our hand on different kinds of batteries, solar cells, dynamos and AC power source.When we move our focus to AC power source, complexity in the project begins. AC current is the same current, that runs in our wall socket. It is generally rated at 220V or in some cases 110V. Working with such a high voltage can be risky. And one of the most common problems that arise with AC current is short circuit. AC current being on such a high potential can be fatal, and if short circuited, it can very easily destroy your components and your circuitry and can also hinder with your house's wiring system. To prevent it from short circuiting, we can use a fuse or a MCB. But still, if the current is not strong enough to trigger the MCB, it will not trip and your electronics components will be destroyed by the current.A similar incident happened with me when I first tried my hands on a AC project. In that project, I was using a transformer to step down the voltage but I accidentally shorted the wires of transformer, resulting in burning of the transformer and the coil of transformer getting completely melted.To prevent such mis-happening, you can use a very simple trick. Simply connect a 220V or 110V light bulb in series with your project. If your circuit is working perfectly fine, light bulb will not glow and nothing will happen but if somehow you short circuit the connections, supply from your project will be cut and the light bulb will start glowing. This trick can surely prevent damages and will help you in saving bucks.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FAB/VDWQ/JNOVOOY3/FABVDWQJNOVOOY3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUP/731V/JNOVOO1N/FUP731VJNOVOO1N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS0/PGY7/JNOVOO7T/FS0PGY7JNOVOO7T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH3/H6BU/JNOVOO9C/FH3H6BUJNOVOO9C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD8/FMAD/JNOVOO9Z/FD8FMADJNOVOO9Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCA/5LC2/JNOVOOD1/FCA5LC2JNOVOOD1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMO/TJU7/JNOVOOFF/FMOTJU7JNOVOOFF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9H/SH8M/JNOVOOGY/F9HSH8MJNOVOOGY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F70/HDBH/JNOVOOJZ/F70HDBHJNOVOOJZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSD/OEYS/JNOVOOMB/FSDOEYSJNOVOOMB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6V/52AW/JNOVOOQF/F6V52AWJNOVOOQF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC8/BU0O/JNOVOOSS/FC8BU0OJNOVOOSS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOQ/3TOC/JNOVOOWE/FOQ3TOCJNOVOOWE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSN/75ZV/JNOVOOWM/FSN75ZVJNOVOOWM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6I/8JZ6/JNSR3VMK/F6I8JZ6JNSR3VMK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZY/DTA0/JNSR3VML/FZYDTA0JNSR3VML.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOV/D3F7/JNOVOPOJ/FOVD3F7JNOVOPOJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOC/02BI/JNULEAUN/FOC02BIJNULEAUN.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: TIP 2: AC Short Circuit Protection System"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Lithium ion batteries have become a lot popular these days.

I am seeing a lot of new photographer coming to forefront and clicking some stunning photos. This is because of the technological advancements taking place. Camera in mobiles phones are becoming better and better  these days and are thus encouraging people to go out and click some awesome looking photos. But the problem with mobile photography is that, all modern day smartphones do not have a dedicated physical button for clicking photos and moving your thumb again and agin between focus and camera shutter can ruin the quality and look of the shot that you are aiming. But you can very easily fix this problem by making a DIY remote shutter.You only need a push button, a 470 ohm resistor and a 4 pin audio jack. Connect a long piece of wire to the ground and mic connection of the audio jack. On the other end of wire, connect the push button with a 470 ohm resistor in between. Insulate the circuit with some tape and apply a small piece of double sided tape on the lower side of the circuit and your remote shutter is ready. Plug in the headphone jack, open the camera app and start clicking some stunning shots.Beware, this trick only works with android devices. You can not use it with apple iPhones because new iPhones do not come with audio jack ;-) and also apple has a small IC fitted inside all their compatible wired audio devices, which helps in communication between the controller buttons and the mobile phone.

Your desk is full of sharp and dangerous tools that can very easily tamper the wire of your headphones. Think what will happen to your headphones if they touched the blazing hot soldering iron. You can very easily get rid of this problem by making a wireless bluetooth receiver for your headphones. You only need a bluetooth audio dongle along with a 3.7v li-ion battery and female USB port. Images of all the parts is given above.Connections: Connect positive of your battery to pin one of the USB port and negative to pin 4. Now using some tape, insulate the USB port and the solder connections that you just made. Plug in the dongle and connect the headphones to the 3.5mm audio jack. Your wireless receiver is ready now.

[UPDATE: It's been brought to my attention that most power supplies are different from the one I'm using in this tutorial. Most folks say that .1 is a better setting for single ring. (check out my latest tutorial where I'm using a 10-amp power supply and .2 is the norm for that one) This power supply did just fine at .30, so I would create a test piece and start out at the lowest setting and make adjustments from there and create a measurement sheet to keep on hand.]A good indication for knowing whether you should turn it up or down is if it has a pink (salmon-like) color then your amperage is too low. So turn it up a tad & check again in 30 minutes. If you are getting tiny bumps, knots or a browning color then it's too high. Turn it down a bit & check again in 30 minutes. If you got really big bumps & it just looks all chopped & screwed then you can take your dremel & use the hard stone sanding bits & grind it back to a semi-smooth surface & try again on a lower setting. Keep in mind you don't want your ring shank to be too thick. You can create your own measurement sheet to help you remember what amps you need based on the size & shape of the pieces you will be doing on a regular basis.  I like to keep a single ring in the bath for about 6-8 hours. A good tip is slow & steady wins the race. Don't try to rush the process cause you'll either burn it or get a really uneven coat which may flake off. So patients is key.

When it does start to evaporate just re-fill with distilled water and copper brightener. In case you're wondering, my voltage dropped a bit in this second photo.

Once you get more comfortable with how everything fits you can use a slightly cut board that's 3 by 3.Note: I cheated a little, the transistor is surface mounted because I salvaged it from another boar which meant that I had a good deal of extra space on account of the fact that I did not use 3 of the holes. putting the transistor trough the holes means that the space will work out just the same.the lane with the most components is going the collector  which handles 4 spaces, however the secondary ( if you use a small-ish gauge) can fit in with either the led leg or the resistor.Warning: before you get started make sure you understand the orientation of all the components its going to save you a lot of trouble. -the first and foremost the primary is the coil has a top and bottom, working with a pnp means that the transistor needs a higher voltage on the collector than on the base which means you need to drive a positive current towards the gate. mixing up which side is up is going to result in the system not working. so remember induction is always in the opposite direction meaning that if your chip is connected to the bottom of your secondary the positive end of your coil should be at the bottom as well. ( also note that making the primary and secondary spiral in the same direction makes it a whole lot easier to figure this out) - the second mixup happens because of the LED, its no huge problem just desolder and swap em round. For this example assume that the silver side is facing away from you and make that you default position. The lane system works from left to right solder each component as explained ( 4th lane is the furthest right lane you have.)4th laneno transistor connections here connect a wire which is going to run to the rocker switch.

This time around I used 4 rotations on the primary and 250 on the secondary and it worked just fine.Right now I'm doing little more than gestimating how long the pvc should be then cutting off the excess after Iv done the winding.Things to take into account:- a small length of the pipe will go into the base so don't cut it off exactly at the start of your winding. ( usually 0.5 cm to 1 cm is enough space to work with.)- to make things easier cut a notch where you start to put a starting length inside the pipe. This helps a lot for 3 specific things. keeping the wire in place while you wind, making it easier for you to count how many rotations have been done and finally allowing for easy access to the secondary.- pre clean the ends for soldering, use a heat source and scorch a small length at the ends and either clean off the enamel with a knife or fine sandpaper.

Described in simpler terms no ground means light no go go. so when you have a neon lamp in your hand you act as the most negative point possible and thus set up a potential difference through the lamp making it light up.the biggest problem here is to create a extremely negative point, several people  suggested using a sheet of tinfoil which would allow for a greater potential difference which made things a great deal simpler, because all you need is a large surface area for electron emission. So using a coil and some conductive tape I was able to induce a constant potential difference when the cube was in the magnetic field.  if you do not want to spend the time curing the resin or messing around with the molds you can just solder the coil to a neon lamp and work from there.the basic principle is that you need a surface that's large to emit  electrons and another to conduct them from the coil.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FXX/1F3N/IJ7WOS0R/FXX1F3NIJ7WOS0R.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFM/SSDZ/IJ7WOFED/FFMSSDZIJ7WOFED.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ6/G2KT/IJ7WOQBR/FZ6G2KTIJ7WOQBR.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: The Proximity Light!"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "I only had molding rubber on hand so I had  no choice as to the material I had to use.

First lets start off by defining some key components of bio-hacking. \u00a0Bio-hacking is part of the trans-humanist movement and trans-humanism is just achieving something beyond human abilities, be they, intellectual or physical or even spiritual. \u00a0Like any well known movement there are certain groups within the movement. There are many theoreticians that predict the future, and some futurists, like Ray Kurzweil talk about the future and by extension talk about trans-humanism. \u00a0Part of the theory for many futurists is that far in the future we won't be exactly human and our technology will likely take us beyond being human, ie into trans-humanism.\u00a0 Some people see trans-humanism as a dark scary void of sorts, I was one of those people, until I saw it didn't have to be like \"the Borg\" from Star Trek it can instead be inspiring and motivating. \u00a0Some trans-humanists, called Grinders, practice what they call \"practical trans-humanism\" and it's happening now. What I would like to do, aside from giving you a glimpse into this fascinating sub-culture, is give you an opportunity to safely experience \"practical trans-humanism.\"\u00a0\u00a0 I learned about trans-humanism by looking on websites about future utopias and especially by reading Ray Kurzweil's \"The singularity\", which is about trans-humanism, the singularity and so much more.\u00a0 Please see my extensive list of links at the end for a great deal more information and read \u00a0some books on futurist theories or trans-humanism if it interests you. Let's start off by saying that in the future, hopefully, everyone will be healthy and happy. \u00a0If everyone isn't, then technology will step in to assist them. \u00a0But what about for those of us that feel an ennui (dissatisfaction) with everyday life. \u00a0What about those of us that seek more from life, sort of like Neo in the matrix? \u00a0Well there is hope. \u00a0One day if you get into an accident and lose a leg, a robotic prosthesis will likely make you near whole again. \u00a0But these prosthesis are getting very good, and soon they may surpass normal human ability. what then? \u00a0People will start to seek out being something more than they are. \u00a0Today, there are around a thousand people walking the earth that can feel magnetic fields with their hands. \u00a0As real as you or I would pet our dog, these people can feel their microwaves energy. \u00a0They can feel the power that is being emitted at their face through their computer monitor, trust me it's there. \u00a0They can sense underground power lines and high voltage and all other manner of magnetic or electromagnetic fields. \u00a0 The movement is called \"grinding\" and it is pretty new, but it only took hearing about it to give me the bug so to speak. \u00a0With my love for technology it was only a matter of time, and I'm not alone. \u00a0 The grinders are practicing the future now. \u00a0Giving abilities that no other humans have. \u00a0With their technology, as crude as some of it is, they can feel things almost no other human on earth can. I have an EMF (electromagnetic field) meter at home. \u00a0It will tell me with great accuracy what strength a field is near the probe. \u00a0But it cannot ever give me the intuitive feel for what the field is like. \u00a0It cannot allow me to feel it in 3 dimensions. \u00a0To \"see\" how big it is by wrapping my hands around it, but the grinders can tell me this and more. \u00a0How? \u00a0As stated above some of the grinder methods were crude in the beginning. \u00a0But today, they are a sophisticated bunch of body-hackers that, through specific implants, can do things you and I simply cannot. \u00a0This sounds like science fiction; Body implants, advanced abilities etc. \u00a0but you can try it out in the comfort of your own home, and I will show you how. Typically grinders will implant a small Neodymium magnet just below the skin, close to the nerve, in their non-dominant hand's ring finger. \u00a0So, me being right handed, would put it in my left hand ring finger for example. \u00a0 They make a small incision, pop in a bio-neutral magnet, coated in PTFE or medical grade silicon \u00a0or parylene or some combination of these things. \u00a0 The wound, once healed, and sometimes before then, will close with the magnet inside, allowing the lucky recipient the power to actually feel magnetic fields. Interestingly, after having the implant for a while many grinders report a sense that the magnet has become part of them, they feel its sense as an extension to their body, no longer a foreign object the magnet has become a 6th sense.Now, we are not going to do that! \u00a0Firstly, I will not recommend it, for legal reasons and secondly I said you could experience it at home. In comfort. \u00a0 Please see the links at the end if you wish to further explore trans-humanism or Grinders or magnetic implants etc. My way is easy and pain free. \u00a0It only requires 2 items. \u00a0A small Neodymium magnet and Elmer's glue.\u00a0 I use Elmer's glue because it dries reasonably fast and it won't stick permanently to your skin. \u00a01. Put a SMALL drop of glue on your finger tip, any finger will do, since this isn't permanent.\u00a0\u00a0Spread the glue around a little.2. Place the Neodymium magnet into the layer of glue. \u00a0Again since this isn't permanent you can experiment with orientation and positioning as you see fit. \u00a0I use a cylinder style magnet and usually stand the cylinder up. \u00a0I believe that gives some mechanical advantage to the field and allows for more sensitivity in feeling things. \u00a0I could be wrong.3. When the small thin layer of glue has dried, or skinned over, with the magnet attached, and you can turn your hand upside down \u00a0without the magnet falling off then proceed to add another drop of glue on top of the magnet, allowing it to drip down over the magnet and encompass it a little. \u00a0See images for help.4. Hold flat and steady for around 10 minutes to allow to dry. \u00a0If it takes longer than this, you probably added too much glue.5. Enjoy your new sense.THINGS TO FEEL. First try to put your hand/finger near fields and stay away from metal if you can. \u00a0The metal will attract the magnet too much, since it is only held by a little glue, and it will pull it off of your hand. \u00a0Look instead for anything that will give off a field.\u00a0 Try the cord of a window air conditioner. \u00a0Just run your finger over, or close to the INSULATED power cord while the appliance is running. \u00a0Try this with all manner of electrical cords. \u00a0BUT BE CAREFUL NOT TO TOUCH ANY ACTUAL BARE WIRES. ALSO BE CAREFUL AND LOOK OUT FOR BAD SPOTS IN THE WIRES THAT YOU MAY NOT HAVE NOTICED BEFORE. \u00a0I ONLY WANT YOU TO TOUCH THE OUTER RUBBER INSULATION OF THE POWER CORD.\u00a0 Sorry, I had to get that out of the way. Seriously be careful. Try putting your hand near any powerful appliances. \u00a0Sometimes you can get close and don't have to touch anything, you will feel small vibrations in your hand. \u00a0You could even make your own electromagnet by wraping some wire around a nail and then momentarily touching the wire to a 9V battery it will create a pretty nice field. \u00a0I have done this and it is a sure thing, if you cannot find any other fields. Also, go outside. \u00a0Train stations are apparently a great source of fields. \u00a0being close to a power station could be interesting. \u00a0Walking around the streets, you may find fields that seemingly come from no where. \u00a0They could be underground utilities or maybe underground equipment.\u00a0 After you have felt some fields you may want to add a magnet to the other hand or more magnets to both hands (really get a 3D feel).\u00a0 This way you can actually get your hands around a field, really feel the shape and size of it. I would recommend you stay away from Airports, banks, \u00a0government building and anywhere that it will look suspicious or strange to be \"feeling\" the air with your hands. \u00a0It may not be illegal (check your local laws first) but it might get you detained which wouldn't be fun. \u00a0Please see my pictures and links. \u00a0Thank you.

This is my first \"Instructables\" and also the submission for the planters challenge. In order to come up with the planter design, I tried to incorporate few very trending things in the DIY communities: 1. 3D printer2. LEDs3. Magnets4. CraftAfter spending considerable amount of time brainstorming, I decided to this self-watering planter that can work as a desktop planter with LEDs illuminating it and also as a fridge magnet if you are too tired of the usual souvenir magnets that your friend/family/neighbor gave you of places you have probably never been to. And who wouldn't want to a put a nice planter on a fridge, right? Alongside, I also wanted to make it wirefree (when used as a desktop planter) with a fancy switching mechanism. Instead of turning an ON/OFF switch (who wants switches anyways!), I came up with a simple mechanism where if you connect the light and electronic case to the planter, the LEDs automatically turns on and if you detach it, the LEDs turn off. Now that's convenient! And let's all be honest: keeping plants are fun but watering is an added chore that anybody would want to put aside. For that reason, I also incorporated the self watering mechanism to keep the soil moist and hydrated for few days. Now, all these seem like the project will need loads of things and a long time to make. However, that is not the case. I have tried to keep this project as simple as possible to make and with things that you have lying around in your house (assuming you are a DIYer and have a 3D printer). If not, a single order from amazon or couple of trips to dollarstore and an electronic store will suffice. With all these said, let's look at all the materials that are needed: 1. 3D printer + filament spools (depend on your colour preference).2. 3D printed parts (planter, water reservoir plate, LED and electronics holder and cover). 3. Epoxy 4. Oil colours 5. Hot glue gun 6. Jute rope 7. Superglue 8. Wire (you can use the wires from CAT5 cable)9. Battery (9V battery)10. LED strip 11.

Depending on your printer settings and what magnet you are using, you may need to use superglue to hold the magnets down if they are smaller or widen the holes slightly to fit the magnets. You can sand down the inside using dremel or you can trim off some plastic using hobby knife (please be careful when doing this). My preferred method for tight fits is heating the area/magnet using a heat gun and pushing it into the holes until they sit flush. Making sure that the magnets sit flush is very important for the magnetic switches (which we will be building in a the upcoming steps) to work.

The magnets must be conductive so that electricity can pass through these when the LEDs need to be turned on. Pass two wires through the two holes near the center of the part (as shown in the picture). The holes are 2.5mm in diameter. Strip both ends of the wires and then put the magnets into the holes, making sure that the conductors from the wires (on the magnets side) are making contact with the magnets. This can be achieved in multiple ways (soldering the wires to the magnets, hot glue, etc.). I took the easier route and made the contact by having the wire strands pinched by the magnets in the holes.

Let the solder joints cool down before putting the LED strip back into the channel.

Please refer to the attached schematics for the wiring connections.For wiring, I have used soldering iron to solder the wire joints and used heat shrink tubes to shrink wrap the soldered joints. Alongside, I only had 9V battery at my disposal so I have used it for this build. Although the strip is 12VDC, 9VDC battery works with the LED strip. Only drawback is that the LEDs are dimmed a bit. I used a battery cap for 9V to connect the battery securely. Once the connections are made, nicely tuck all the wires and the battery into the back, making sure that no wire is getting pinched. Once you are happy with it, put on the back cover. It should be a push fit and won't require any additional fastener.

Negative ions are good for your health and make you feel better. In order to give molecules extra electrons, the generator must create a very high potential (voltage) between the generator and ground. In the case of this negative ion generator, it creates 15,000 volts.Now, isn't that dangerous???In short, no. High voltage doesn't kill people, high current does. A little math:V*I=W12v*0.1A = 1.2W1.2W = 15,000v * 0.00008AWhat this says is that if the generator was 100% efficient, it could achieve a maximum current of 0.08 milliamps. 5mA is the minimum current required for any lasting harm to be done, and this is well below that.You only have to read below if you are very interested in high voltage and shocks.Most static shocks occur due to capacitance with ground. Basically, every person is a walking capacitor. They are one plate, the ground is the other, and their shoes (or air) is the dielectric. You get charged up due to the triboelectric effect, and when you touch somebody else, you balance the charges in your capacitors. If you touch something metal connected to the ground, you discharge yourself.This is one way to create a shock. The other way is to provide a direct path for the electricity to go, for example, touching two metal plates at different potentials at the same time. This is what causes most electrocutions. In this example, you are not a capacitor, but a conductor. These shocks are more effective because they are more controllable and more powerful, due to lower resistance.I tried both methods when constructing this device. Method 1 (human capacitors) works fairly well when you are barefoot, but can barely be felt when you are wearing shoes.

It turns out there may be an easy way to do just that.\nYou've probably heard of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). With TMS, brain-hacking gadgeteers and doctors both use extremely strong pulsed magnetic fields to make big changes to how the brain's working... instantly. Some obscure research suggests this works the other way around, too.\nInstead of a really strong field applied for an extremely short period of time, a weak one that lasts much longer may also have a powerful effect... and weak fields are a lot easier for you to make at home.\nIn short, a weak magnetic field that pulses at the same frequency for a long period of time may cause the brain to \"sync up\" to the frequency at which it's pulsing. (http://www.elfis.net/elfol8/e8elfeeg2.htm)\nIf so, then there's an easy way to overclock that grey matter. You don't even need flashing-light glasses or loud tones throbbing in your ears, just a ten-minute project with a 555 and a relay coil (or any other electromagnet) and a variable resistor.\nCheck out the schematic. It's not the usual way of doing a 555, it's simpler. You can forget S1 and R2 if you want, though you lose the extra \"setting.\" All the schemtic does is get the 555 to produce a totally symmetric square wave across L1. L1 can be any coil on an iron core, but ideally it has a DC resistance of about 15K.\nWhy? The magnetic field can be incredibly weak and still produce an effect, so using a low-impedance electromagnet just wastes batteries.\nThe schematic also includes a Zener-biased BC547, putting out a few mV of white noise into the metal case around the device. You can also use twenty or thirty centimeters of hookup wire as an antenna. What does this do? The science is a little less clear, so consider it optional. However, if you accept the claims that other forms of electromagnetic interference can have physiological effects, this part might help to \"jam\" them.\nADVANCED VERSIONS:\nSome scientists have found the brain responds best to magnetic pulses, instead of continuous waves. Therefore, if you want more of an effect, try re-buiding the coil.\nGet a piece of ferrite rod and wind the coil around it. Now take a magnet and use it to bias the ferrite rod just below saturation. The result is something called a \"magnetic pulse compressor,\" which creates a low-power magnetic pulse with an extremely fast rise time (faster than you could easily generate by normal means).\nEven better are a few strips of Mu-Metal sheeting for a core. The Mu-Metal's incredible permeability makes for a really strong magnetic pulse, while the nearly instant saturation of the material takes care of the pulse compression part.\nYou can go even further by making a relaxation oscilator, instead of relying on the 555. A unijunction or programmable unijunction transistor, and a small handful of external parts, is all you need.\nHave the oscillator dump the charge from the capacitor through the coil around the core. When it does, it'll create a \"flyback\" magnetic pulse as soon as the transistor turns off... this is even more powerful and faster than what you get from the 555.", "title": "Put Your Brain Into Overdrive, Wirelessly, With an Ultra-Simple 555 Circuit", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Put-Your-Brain-into-Overdrive-Wirelessly-with-an/", "section": "home", "steps": [], "channel": "No channel to show"}, {"category": "No category to show", "description": "I am back after my first version of solar powered water tank https://www.instructables.com/id/Green-Solar-Powe.... .I moved and lost the convenience of my previous system but I have plans for a larger garden this time.

First thing you need is something to hold your recovered rainwater in. My new design uses two recycled FOOD GRADE water totes of 250 imp. gallons (275 US gallons) each. They cost about $150 each and I easily sourced them though  www.used.ca  You You can see whats available in your area by simply googling \"1000 liter water tote near me\". You can get them much cheaper if you don't care about what they were used for originally (lubricant, pesticide etc).

Only use the non-food grade containers to store water for firefighting, pressure washing or similar. The food totes that I've seen are 250 gallons and 300 gallons and all come with an integral valve at the bottom and a fill cap on the top. I'm sure there are other sizes out there but these seem to be the most common.An important thing to remember is to connect all of your water barrels with a common manifold so that they all drain and fill at the same time if using a single supply source as I have. You can see the white PVC tube between the two barrel outlets that allows both filling and draining at the same time.These barrels weigh a considerable amount when full, about 4150 lbs for the water alone, then another 140 lbs per tank!

There has been some good dialog in the comments section as to safety when dealing with batteries and for cohesiveness I will restate the important parts below.BATTERY SAFETY Open battery terminals are a hazard if they are in an open area that is potentially subjected to contaminants (liquid or solid) as these can lead to 'tracking' (where the battery finds a minor conductive path) or where they can directly contact a conductive material creating a short (create a current path between positive and negative).Be careful when connecting to the battery to not short out the battery terminals as this can allow an excessive amount of current and vaporize (yes literally) the conducting object between them, whether this is wire, watch or even a screwdriver and cause burns and fires.Do not forget that when a lead acid battery charges it produces small amounts of hydrogen gas which needs to be able to vent to outside as it is flammable. Do not smoke around a charging battery!Do not store or subject your battery to direct sunlight or heat as this can cause your battery to dry out and/or potentially damage the battery case with warping and cracking causing acid leaks. Any acid on or around the battery should be neutralized with baking soda first and then rinsed away with water before drying.If you need to top up the electrolyte levels in a non-maintenance free battery, only used distilled water so as not to introduce contaminants into your battery acid and reduce it's longevity.  Wear gloves and face-shield if adding water to a battery to minimize the potential for contact with acid.Use an inline fuse with a current rating slightly higher than the maximum current of the pump you will be using, this will prevent the battery from potentially outputting massive current through the circuitry if a problem was to occur with any component of the system.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F00/9TO0/J1WWABBA/F009TO0J1WWABBA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8R/HHAV/J3EPQPD9/F8RHHAVJ3EPQPD9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F19/Y2AO/J3EPUQZH/F19Y2AOJ3EPUQZH.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: RV Water Pump and Battery"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "Here is the solar panel I bought that came with it's own charge controller. This is a 40 watt panel and will recharge the battery I selected in an afternoon. For a solar panel it is important to also have a charge controller as it regulates the charge to the battery and prevents damage. The package was on sale for about 90 bucks, and CT often has sales like this so if you're not in a hurry its worth the wait.For the electrical connections any wire of 14 gauge or larger would be more than adequate. Be extra careful when connecting to the battery to notshort out the battery terminals (create a current path between positive and negative with no load) as this can allow an excessive amount of current and vaporize (yes literally) the conducting object between them, whether this is wire, watch or even a screwdriver and cause burns.The circuit will function without an inline fuse, but can be dangerous should a short occur with the pump, wiring or switch. So for safety safe use an inline fuse with a current rating slightly higher than the maximum current of the pump you will be using. These can be picked up at any hardware or Canadian tire store.I have included a sketched schematic of how to connect all the required items. Always follow the manufactures directions for connecting the solar panel and charge regulator as there can be slight differences in connection requirements. My drawing is a guideline. The important things to remember are to fuse the input supply from the battery at a slightly higher amperage than the maximum your pump can draw and to follow that with a switch before the pump. This is important as if you have to work on the pump for whatever reason you can shut off the supply voltage and remove the possibility of a short.I ended up making a custom bracket to hold my panel away from the side of the shed and at about a 30 degree angle from vertical, aiming south to catch the afternoon sun.Here is a link for the inline fuse.http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/littelfuse-heavy...Here is a link for the solar panel and charge regulator.http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/coleman-40w-fold...", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FMI/4P4S/J1WWABAX/FMI4P4SJ1WWABAX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZC/CG5E/J3EPUV2G/FZCCG5EJ3EPUV2G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7A/7R85/J3EPQPLV/F7A7R85J3EPQPLV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS0/A5A1/J3EPUVAD/FS0A5A1J3EPUVAD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS2/FGM9/J3EPUV2Z/FS2FGM9J3EPUV2Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5H/78NG/J3EPUVYM/F5H78NGJ3EPUVYM.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: 40W Solar Panel and Charge Controller"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Simply a hose reel that I found and liked.No photo of the spray nozzle, so use the one you like :)Here is the one I used.http://www.homehardware.ca/en/rec/index.htm/Outdoo...", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F6T/L688/J3EPUV3H/F6TL688J3EPUV3H.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Outlet From Pump to Hose Reel"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 9: "}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 10: "}], "channel": "No channel to show"}, {"category": "technology", "description": "\n          Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation is a method for stimulating brain tissue, and in recent years there has been much research on this method as a replacement for Electroconvulsive (Shock) Therapy to combat mental disorders such as depression.

The covering as shown makes them much safer and easier to handle (though caution is still required).If you've had experience with NIB magnets you've already learned this, and probably the hard way: these things are very dangerous if not handled properly!Be careful with NIB magnets of any mass...any magnet larger than a penny is definitely dangerous (and even smaller ones can be if they slam together and shatter). These magnets are sintered, which means that they are not a solid mass of metal or ceramic, but are rather compressed powder. Thus they splinter or shatter very easily.Additionally, they are so strong that two (or more) of them can react while several inches apart, and these two-inchers could easily rip one's flesh off if they pinch together right. They will also attract iron-based metal objects from a distance: scissors, knives, or other objects will unexpectedly be attracted.So when working with these, before you begin make sure you clear your work area of any metal objects. Work with one magnet at a time until you become very certain of your procedures. If two of the magnets used in this project slam together, there is essentially no way to get them apart without damaging them (actually I'm sure a way could be found to separate them, but it's certainly best to not let them join).When cutting the tape off the ends there is a special technique I use to prevent letting my scissors attach to the magnet, which I will explain directly", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: Safety Precautions"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "- Standard duct tape (I used black)\r- 1/4\" masking tape.\r- Double-sided tape (I used 3M brand)\r- Aluminum foil (4\" square)\r- Small scissors (larger ones will be more strongly attracted to the magnet)\r- Magnet (keep far away from scissors or any other metal objects, except intentional attachment)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSV/IHMP/537EZBF96Z6/FSVIHMP537EZBF96Z6.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Gather Materials"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "The foil is simply used to prevent the tape from sticking to the magnet.

The design isn't mine, this is just my mod of it. In the original design, the LED Throwie is on from the moment you put it together. This can be annoying if you're planning to make tons of these, or if you want to make them ahead of time but not have the battery run out. Someone has already posted a mod that adds an on/off tab to the throwie, however I've taken it one step further: in this design the throwie automatically turns on when it sticks to something, and turns off as soon as you remove it! It's just as simple to make as normal throwies, and doesn't require any extra materials either! These also work great as simple LED pinch lights. Credit goes to everythingdigital for the idea (it was mentioned in a comment), but the implementation is mine.\nI'll point out that though this instructable may seem long or complicated at first, it's only because I wanted to make sure it was well documented. It is actually VERY easy and VERY quick to do. Making these throwies should be just as easy, and take no longer than the original design. Once you've done one and you understand how it works, you'll be whipping these out in no time.\nFrom the original throwie:\nDeveloped by the Graffiti Research Lab a division of the Eyebeam R&D OpenLab, LED Throwies are an inexpensive way to add color to any ferromagnetic surface in your neighborhood. A Throwie consists of a lithium battery, a 10mm diffused LED and a rare-earth magnet taped together.

However if you plan to make a large quantity, you should buy all your parts in bulk online, as Radioshack would get kinda pricey for more than a few of these. You can go to the original throwie article (https://www.instructables.com/id/LED-Throwies) for info on where to buy the parts.\nWhat You Need:\n-5mm Diffused LED (the original uses 10mm, but these were cheap in an assorted pack at Radioshack, so I got them)\n-CR2032 3V Button Cell\n-3/8\" x 1/16\" Neodymium Disc Magnet\n-Scotch Tape, or Strapping Tape (Strapping is better, but Scotch works fine)\n-Double sided tape, or just about any glue\n-Leftover cardboard from battery package/other packaging\nNote: The magnets I used were 3/16\" diameter (that's all Radioshack had at the time). They seem plenty strong for just sticking the throwie to things, however if you wanted to actually throw it at something, I think you'd want something a little stronger so that it would actually stick. I'd recommend 3/8\" diameter by 1/16\" thick, though you can try other sizes and see what works best. What is important is the magnet has to be smaller than the battery - half the size should work fine, two-thirds is too large. You'll see what I mean when you see how the design works.\nAs of March 2011, if you purchase all the parts at Radioshack, one throwie would cost you about $7 ($5.50 of that is the battery).\u00a0\nAccording to the original throwie article, if you purchase all your items bulk online, you can get the cost down to about a doller per throwie.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FA5/V7S0/GKTJNVPR/FA5V7S0GKTJNVPR.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Parts and Materials"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The first step is to bend the LED's wire. You want it so that the space between the two wires is just barely wider than the width of the battery plus the magnet.\nTo start, test the LED by placing it so one wire touches each side of the battery. The longer wire typically goes to the positive side (top) of the battery, but as some LED's are different, if yours isn't working just flip it and try again.\u00a0\nNext you want to make your first bend. The wire to be bent will be the negative side. Using needle nosed pliers, make a perpendicular bend a little over 1/8\" below the LED (see picture).\nNow you need to bend the wire back to parallel with the other. Determine where to make the bend by placing your magnet on your battery and comparing to their width. Your next bend should put the spacing between the wires just barely thicker (think about one wire's width) than the battery and the magnet. Look at the images to see what the bend should look like.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FED/ZNRK/GKTJNVQ0/FEDZNRKGKTJNVQ0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL2/AP5W/GKTJNVPZ/FL2AP5WGKTJNVPZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Bend the LED Wire"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "The next step is to make a platform that will hold the LED wire away from the magnet.\nTo make this more clear I will describe how the final assembly will go together: the magnet will sit on the negative (bottom) side of the battery, pushed most of the way to one side. Directly opposite it will go a platform that prevents the LED's negative wire from contacting the magnet. There will be about 1/8\" between the magnet and the platform. The LED wires will slip over the battery, magnet, and platform from the side of the magnet.\u00a0The positive wire will simply touch the entire positive side. The negative wire will go all the way over the magnet, and sit on the platform, suspended just barely over the magnet, close but not touching. When the throwie sticks to something, the wire will be pressed into the magnet, completing the circuit. See the pictures for a better idea.\nCut a strip of cardboard from the packaging the battery came in, about 1\" long to start, and about 3/8\" wide.\nFold the cardboard back and forth, until you have a piece of cardboard about the thickness of the magnet (3 layers for me). Using double sided tape or glue, stick all the back and forth folds together to make one piece. Put a piece of double sided tape on the bottom of the platform to stick it to the battery.\nOnce the piece is glued or taped, it should be just thick enough to sit on the battery next to the magnet, and hold the LED wire less than a wire thickness above the magnet.Note:  if the LED is lighting up, before you assume your platform is too thin, try applying pressure to the very end of the negative wire, so as to lift the middle part off the magnet. This is usually all that is needed to make it work, and your platform is most likely the right size. When you perform the final wrap of tape around the assembly, the tape will apply this pressure so that the circuit remains broken.\nLook at the image to understand more clearly.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8X/IUEO/GKTJNVR3/F8XIUEOGKTJNVR3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXO/7HDD/GKTJNVR4/FXO7HDDGKTJNVR4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4W/V60V/GKTJNVR2/F4WV60VGKTJNVR2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPY/ES9E/GKTJNVR1/FPYES9EGKTJNVR1.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Make Your Separator Platform"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "The final step is to wrap the entire assembly in tape. You can use either strapping tape or scotch tape for this. Strapping tape is more durable, but scotch tape worked fine for me.\nTake about 2\" of tape, and wrap it around the entire assembly. Pull it tightly over the end of the negative wire, until the middle of the wire no longer makes contact with the magnet and the LED stays off.\nIf the LED is not going off, try repositioning the magnet, or making the platform slightly thicker by adding a layer of tape. Also the space between the wires could be too little, so try adjusting the bend so that there is enough space for the wire to hang over the magnet without touching it. It may seem tricky at first, but after you get it once you'll get all of them correct right away from then on, without any adjusting needed.\nThat's it! Make a bunch, and go out and have a throwie party! Throw them at anything magnetic, and they should turn on as soon as they stick!

A wireless charger uses induction coils to transmit and receive electrical current from charger to device.  All you have to do is get the two coils close together your device will charge.  Now, not all phones/tablets have this ability built in. Most new Android phones support Qi charging, but iPhones and older Androids do not.  However, you can buy a receiver coil that will attach to terminals under the back cover of your phone, like this one, or this one. that plugs into the charging port of your phone.Most coils work over a distance of about 2-5 mm, depending on how well it can induce a current into the receiving coil.  The coil I've picked out will transmit 5 Volts at 1 Amp, meaning it's rated at 5 Watts (5V+1A=5W).  It utilizes a micro-USB 5V input, so any standard micro-USB charging cable and adapter will work on it.  However, it is a good idea to use an adapter that has at least a 1 Amp output, to support the specs of the wireless charger and ensure good induction. I use a couple wireless chargers for my devices.  I've affixed them to a little dock I've made on my nightstand.  People have also incorporated wireless chargers into convenient places like furniture and car dashboards.  But I've never seen anyone make one wearable though.  But I figure most people keep their phones in pants or purse pocket when they're out and about, and a pocket's tight enclosure is a perfect environment for wireless charging.

Here's a small write up of the connections and function that I've planned out:The charge controller will charge the battery via a micro-USB port from a wall charger. I wanted an easy, universal way to charge the battery, and make the system adaptable and safe.  If I want, I can just plug the system into a wall and set up my phone or tablet on it just like a regular wireless charger, then when I 'm ready to go, pull it off the charger, put the system in my pocket and keep charging with a now full battery.  The battery will feed the DC-DC converter, and the converter connects to the wireless charging board.  The charging pad comes off that board and will be velcroed to my pocket in a position that allows charging whenever I put my phone in there.  I want the battery and circuits to fit inside a small pouch. The components are all small enough to fit in this pouch, allowing for a light, compact and easy to carry system.  My goal is to have the pouch clip onto a belt or outside pocket, with the charging pad connecting to the pouch from my pocket.  There will only be a 3.7 V LiPoly battery feeding the Qi circuit when it's not plugged into a wall.  The battery will be charged via the charge controller, which basically regulates the current from the micro-USB and ensures a constant flow of about 4 V into the battery, suitable for charging.  While the battery is rated to 3.7 V, the wireless charger requires 5 V to operate. Therefore, between the battery and the charger there will need to be a DC-DC conversion circuit.  This circuit will step up the voltage from 3.7 V - 5 V to make it usable.  The converter utilizes a USB output connection.  This is convenient, because the Qi charging circuit uses a micro-USB input connection. This means that we can just use a standard USB to micro-USB cable for this connection.  Once these connections are made, the components will be fixed together with epoxy and will be housed in the pouch with the Qi charging pad outside this pouch.  Now before you start soldering or splicing anything, get a rough idea of how everything will fit together, maybe draw your connections on a white board.

This switch will shut off the power (due to the nature of induction charging, you will drain the battery even if there is no phone charging off the pad, this switch will shut off the power when it's not in use). Solder a short wire to the other end of the switch.  Splice the wires from the switch and the negative side of the DC-DC circuit to the respective battery wires.Take these spliced wires and solder them to their respective terminals on the output side of the charge controller.

Therefore the light is dimmer than we would like. 2. In order to reduce resistance, the wires in a telephone cord were used. Telephone cord is solid copper and is very small. **Info Note** Solid wiring transfers electrons more easily than braided wire, like speaker wire for example. Couple that with the low voltage we are using and the very small size of the wire reducing resistance even further so we get the best flow we can.3.

An electrode is a conductor through which electric current is passed and comes in many forms. Here you find out how Holly made hers and you can learn to make your own.1. Gather your 4 pennies (copper/zinc), grab your drill, and a small drill bit. Your drill bit should twice the size of the phone wire used after it has been stripped (or that general size).2. Drill a hole through all of the pennies, except 1, near the edge. **Safety Note** Don't forget to use your center punch as well as safety glasses.3. Now you can use the extra wires from the phone cord that was stripped earlier.   3.1 Collect your pennies and your wire. Strip one end of a wire bare (about 1 inch) and insert it into the hole of the penny try to loop it through the hole again and then twist the bare wire and the insulated part together to tie them off.   3.2 Next use your \"Elmer's Blue Bull Polly Glue\"  (use safety glasses) and glue the wires together. You can do this by directly squirting glue on to the wires or use your \"Acid Brush\" to paint the glue on (which is what Holly did). It is a lot easier to use the acid brush and a lot cleaner.   3.3 Repeat this until all pennies have a wire attached. **Info Note** One penny will be unaltered, 3 will have both cotter pins and wires.4. Grab your cotter pins    4.1 After the glue has dried on the pennies, wire strip the other end of the wire bare about 1 inch.   4.2 At this point take the bare wire and a cotter pin and weaver the bare wire though the head of the cotter pin.    4.3 Next try to wedge the bare wire (all the way up to the insulation of the wire) underneath the head of the cotter pin between the legs of the cotter pin.   4.4 Now neatly wrap the wire around the cotter pin neck keeping each roll flush to the next (just for neatness and conductivity).    4.5 Almost done, take the wire and bring it up between the legs of the cotter pin to wedge the wire again.   4.6 Final step, again use your \"Elmer's Blue Bull Polly Glue\"  and glue the wire to the cotter pin. Holly put glue over each roll of the bare wire also to help keep it in place. Again, Holly used the Acid brush to apply the glue.5. Repeat this step to make 2 more of the cotter pin electrodes.6.

When an electrical circuit is capable of conducting current. Or if we go back to our waterfall analogy from earlier it means that the flow can travel down the river. In this case the river is a penny, a wire, and a cotter pin. In order to test for continuity we use a multimeter.1. Set your multimeter to ohms and if it has a audible beep use it also. 1.1 Turn on your multimeter and place the black lead of your meter on one end of the electrode then while holding it in place touch the red lead of the meter to the other end of the electrode. If you are using a digital multimeter you will get zero ohms and an audible beep (if you have that feature on). 2. Repeat test for each electrode.3. If everything checked out and is working good you are ready to move on to the next step. If not go back and check to make sure that the connection to the penny and the cotter pins are tight. Then retest and repeat until you have solved the problem then continue to the next step. We still need to check for continuity in our switch box. The procedure is the same but this time in order to get continuity you have to press the momentary switch. If you get continuity the result is the same as the previous check. If you do not get continuity then retest, if still no continuit you must remove the box lid and check the soldering on the wires and fix it until you get continuity. See all of the pictures below.

Starting in a clockwise direction place the first lemon in its mount/holder. On the front side make a small slice in the lemon peal and push an unmodified penny into the slice. On the back side of the lemon insert a cotter pin electrode (with wire attached) about  3 quarters into the lemon. 2. Second, place the next lemon in its mount/holder. Make a slice along the side of the lemon just big enough for the penny to be pushed into. Now push the penny attached to the electrode from the first lemon into the slice of the second lemon. now the first and second lemons are connected in series.3. Third, take a modified cotter pin electrode and insert it into the back side of the second lemon. Now place the third lemon in its holder/mount and cut a slice in it for the penny electrode. Slide in the free hanging penny electrode connected to the backside of the second lemon. now the first, second, and third lemon are all connected in series. 4. Using you last cotter pin and penny electrode insert the cotter pin side into the back side of lemon three, Next make a slice on the backside of lemon 4 and slide the free hanging penny electrode into the slice.5. OK remember back in step 12.6 I told you to keep one unmodified cotter pin. Take that cotter pin and insert it into the front of lemon 4.6. Now that all pennies and cotter pins are in place connect the Positive side alligator clip to the unmodified penny on lemon 1. Connect the negative side alligator clip to the unmodified cotter pin on lemon 4. Now we are all set it is the \"The Moment of Truth\".7 Push the momentary switch button and...YES IT WORKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Our hypothesis is correct.      (Will 4 lemons have enough current (moving force) to light a L.E.D. light?

Follow on actions:  While there are no pictures to post of this follow on action it should be known that it did occur. Holly went on to connect the lemons and potatoes together as a final  test, she even added a tomato into the line. Amazingly she obtained a higher voltage and the LED got brighter as she added more items to the Bio Battery.2, Conclusion:  The hypothesis was correct an LED can be powered by 4 lemons or 4 potatoes or a mixture of all plus a tomato. 3. Final thoughts to consider. After the experiment was concluded the potatoes were thrown in the garbage. They could have been replanted to grow more potatoes (future instructable perhaps), thrown in a compost bin or even boiled to make mashed potatoes and have them for dinner. However time did not permit any of these actions so they were thrown in the garbage. In the end the lemons used in this instructable were used to make lemonade, and they tasted great, they made a cool refreshing drink.4. How could this Bio Battery be used to power future items as an alternative power source? 4.1 Perhaps power a 12 volt fan with an entire sack of potatoes to cool you off while your making lemonade. 4.2 Run our 9 volt alarm clocks. 4.3 Power book lights/reading LED lights. 4.4 What if we literally had a field of potatoes connected in series while they were still planted in the ground. How long would they last, would they go bad? How much power could we obtain?In the end we have found that this BIO BATTERY is a multi-use power source. We may be able to power our equipment and our bodies with the same power source, but not at the same time. Even after digestion it may be used to create methane gas or fertilize new crops (or both).OtherLessons Learned:   This instructable was about powering an LED with lemons. However it also instructs a basic idea of electrical flow, introduces new terms, couples items to create a switch box and electrode leads and has allowed the opportunity of using hand tools. This lesson starts a basic foundation to build from for future projects.Thank you for reading this Instructable.

This was fast enough that my roommates and I got blisters from pulling them.  I had those lights up for over two years and I wasn't about to go without ambient lighting.  I figured LEDs were the way to go.\rEach module is powered by 12V and is relatively simple in concept.  The number of LEDs you need per module depends on the voltage of the LED.  You'll typically be able to get 3 blues or greens (3.4V each) on a module or 5 reds (2.4V each) on a module.  A VERY large number of modules can be powered off of one supply.  The maximum number of modules that can be powered by a single supply can handle is its amperage divided by the current a single LED pulls.  In my case, I used a 12V 5A power supply from Digium and 20mA LEDs, so that gave me 250 (5/0.02) modules per supply.  That's a whole lot of light!  \rParts for each module:\rA piece of breadboard\r3 blue LEDs (3.4V)\rA 100 ohm resistor\r2 small neodymium magnets\r2 ferromagnetic thumbtacks\rOther materials:\rSoldering Iron\rSolder\rHot Glue Gun\rGlue Sticks\rSpeaker Wire\rA 12V Power Supply", "title": "Modular Magmount LED Lighting", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Modular-Magmount-LED-Lighting/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Your first task is to gather your materials and find the module configuration that suits you.  For each module, you'll need some perfboard (the really cheap stuff if possible), a 100 ohm resistor, three 3.4V blue LEDs, two 1/8\"x1/8\" neodymium magnets, and two ferromagnetic thumbtacks.  For general supplies, you're going to need a 12V power supply, some cheap speaker wire, a soldering iron, some solder (lead/tin), a hot glue gun, and some glue sticks to go with it.  A third hand pcb holder is helpful, but not required.  As for organization on the perfboard, it's really up to you, but I chose long and skinny so my modules would have a similar profile to the wire itself and be less obtrusive.  \rOnce you have decided where the LEDs go, make sure that they are in the correct orientation.  The longer lead is positive and goes away from the resistor.  The resistor will be the link to the ground for the module.  I left a gap between the perfboard and the LEDs so that I could bend them and better distribute the light.  Bend the leads that are going to connect toward each other so that they lay parallel and almost touch.  The end result of this is shown in the next step.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F6E/5GSD/FCEIJ3HX/F6E5GSDFCEIJ3HX.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Materials and Organization"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Now that you have your LED and resistor leads bent to the proper positions, you'll need to solder them together and clip off the excess part of each lead.  Take care NOT to cut the outer leads as you'll need them in a minute.  Try to use the minimum amount of solder that is necessary.\rTake one of the magnets and bend an outer lead around it, creating a spring or coil-like structure.  This will help hold the magnet in place and maintain conductivity.  Once you have both ends coiled properly, insert the magnets and make sure they still fit.  It is fairly easy to mess this up, so you may have to practice it a little.  \rYou must be VERY careful on this step or you will ruin the magnet.  Even relatively short term exposure to high temperatures can cause the magnet to lose its magnetism.  Since the resistor lead isn't magnetic, I would suggest using a tiny bit of solder to connect it to the magnet.  You want this to be a cold solder joint, not a hot solder joint.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FCW/UA9N/FCEIJ3HW/FCWUA9NFCEIJ3HW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Soldering and Coils"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Since everything is soldered now, you only have a little further to go until your LED module is functional.  Take the hot glue gun and glue the magnets down on their sides.  There isn't much need to worry about killing the magnets here since the glue gun doesn't transfer nearly as much heat to them as the soldering iron.  Wait for the glue to harden before attempting the next part.\rOnce the glue has hardened, take the module, set it next to the speaker wire, and mark the wire where the center of each magnet would come in contact with it.  This is where you'll need to insert the thumbtacks on the wire.  Make sure they pierce the conductor inside the wire.  This isn't easy to mess up, but if you're paranoid, you can check with a multimeter to ensure conductivity.  Make sure that each pair of tacks doesn't go into the same conductor.  This is how the modules are powered, and if both tacks go into the same conductor, that module won't work.\rWhen you have the spacing right, you can use the thumbtacks you just put in as a template for the rest of the wire and since they have such a large surface, there's plenty of room for error.  Another plus is that there is no need to have nails in the wall for it.  Just hammer the tips of the tacks into the wall!\rNow that you have your thumbtacks in your wire, connect the 12V supply and attach the module to a pair of tacks.  If it doesn't work, try turning the module around.  Reverse polarity won't hurt it.  If it still doesn't work, make sure your connections are good between LEDs and specifically, between the resistor and its magnet.\rShown is a closeup of a working module and my hallway in near daylight.

The real beauty of this comes into play if a module ever burns out.  There's no way it can affect the remaining modules and you can just pull it off the wire to fix it.  Burnouts happen at a very linear rate, where the Christmas lights burned out at an exponential rate.

To do this, you want to take your magnet wire, pull out about an inch to create the first lead, then start wrapping it around the handle of a large screwdriver. Approximately 30 wraps is a good place to start. Then pull out another inch before cutting the wire to make the second lead. Slide the coil off the handle and wrap the leads once around the coil to hold the coil together.With the coil made, we next want to solder an LED to it. In order for the leads to make a good connection with the LED, we will need to burn (or scrape with scissors) the plastic coating from each lead. After that, you can solder the legs of the LED to each lead of the wire (the direction doesn't matter).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F4L/LFTN/IC0CHEQM/F4LLFTNIC0CHEQM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGH/LXTT/IC0CHEYM/FGHLXTTIC0CHEYM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX9/LIOL/IC0CHF1H/FX9LIOLIC0CHF1H.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Create the Receiver Coil"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "The next thing we need to create is the inducer coil.

Slide the coil off of the handle, wrap the leads around the coil to hold it together, and then use a lighter to burn the coating off both of the leads as well as the center lead.  Now we need to solder the necessary parts to the coil. Take the transistor, and using the diagram to your right, find the \"collector\" leg and solder it to one of the outside leads. Then solder the middle \"base\" leg of the transistor to the 1k ohm resistor. And finally, solder the other end of the 1k ohm resistor to the other outside lead.

The conditioned voltage pulses are sensed by the microcontroller to determine if the tube is being shaken. As long as the tube is shaken, the microcontroller waits. Once the user stops shaking the tube, the microcontroller generates a random number, using an internal 8-bit timer operating in free running mode and outputs the random number between 1 and 6, on the output LEDs. The microcontroller then again waits for the user to shake the tube again.
