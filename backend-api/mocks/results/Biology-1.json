I then began gathering information about snot. Using the search bar in Google, I entered \"What is snot?\" I learned the following facts concerning mucus:  1. Mucus or phlegm are the proper terms when discussing snot.  2. I learned that mucus is a key part to my health.  3. Mucus membranes inside my nose protect me by secreting and stopping germs, pollen, and dust.  4. Mucus and nasal hairs combine as a barrier to protect my lungs.  5. A runny nose can show inflammation and irritation in a body.  6. The color of my mucus can help identify if I am sick.  7. When I have a cold, I secrete up to 60 milliliters of mucus an hour. To my surprise, that equals almost a fourth a can of pop! So in four hours, it would equal one can of pop.  8. Mucus is mostly water and contains proteins, carbohydrates, salt and some cells.  9. Mucus contains a specialized cell type known as a goblet cell. . Most of my mucus drains down my throat without me noticing.  10.Violent nose blowing could cause me to become sicker.  11.

After this, I began researching for mucus/slime recipes. I also researched information concerning mucus and how it helps my body. I was also looking to see if there had been any new information posted on the web concerning my project focus since I began researching. I chose some recipes from the sites below: chemistry.about.com/od/letsmakeslime/\u200e www.sciencebob.com/experiments/polymer.php  https://www.stevespanglerscience.com/lab/experime...  www.hometrainingtools.com/a/slime-recipes-project... http://www.elmers.com/", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJI/D7AL/HV9I2ZKX/FJID7ALHV9I2ZKX.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: 6 Bring on the Slime Recipes and Claying the Prop "}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "March 26th, 2014                                                                                                           Time: 2 hours 45 minutes       5:00 p.m. - 7:45 p.m. I examined my prop and noticed that my clay was dried, but I found some places that needed more clay. I applied the clay and set my nose prop aside to dry. Then I began experimenting with the following ingredients: warm water green food coloring 20 Mule Team Borax Elmer's Carpenter's WoodGlue  Aleene's Clear Gel Tacky Glue My first recipe was 1/8 cup of borax in 473.18 ml of warm water and I stirred until the borax was dissolved. In another bowl, I stirred together two teaspoons of glue gel and three teaspoons of water.I added a few drops of green food dye and stirred. I then poured both mixtures into a baggie. I then sealed and squished the mixtures together. The mixture stayed runny and never became a slime. So I poured the mixture back into the bowl and began adding the glue gel, hoping to have a chemical reaction to form thick slime. I used a whole bottle of gel which consisted of 118 ml and still did not have the expected result. Now I had a problem. The glue gel was too expensive to keep experimenting with to perfect my recipe. So I substituted wood glue for the glue gel and began again. I cut the water down to 236.59 ml and substituted the glue. The mixture was still too runny, so I kept adding glue until it thickened. The mixture had too much of a wet plastic feel and did not feel like slimy mucus.

Then we went to the Dollar Tree to buy some fake snot to use on a later date in my final presentation. When I got back, I started to work on figuring out a way to attach the break away part of my nose to the main structure. My mentor and I thought about it and came to a conclusion. We decided to use wire to hang the break away part to the side of my main structure. I drilled entry holes in my main structure and placed the wire in the holes I drilled. I then did the same to my break away piece. I tied the wire in the inside of the main structure and break away piece. I then used the extra wire on the break away piece to hook on to the loop I created with the wire on the main piece.

I used the following items to construct my board: 20\u201d x 21\u201d black foam board, hair brush with bristles, pliers, clear contact paper, a black Sharpie marker, yardstick, a hot glue gun and glue. Once I had my board finished, I was ready to begin the experiments!  Before each experiment the testing area was prepared using the following steps:  1. I measured a piece of freezer wrap 36 inches long and cut it.  2. From one edge of the freezer wrap I measured and drew a line the length of the paper with a black permanent  sharpie. This would be the line for the placement of the filter in the future experiments.  3. The freezer wrap paper was placed on the testing area first.  4. Then the backboard was placed on the back edge of the freezer wrap.  5. The plunger was removed from the syringe and the syringe was filled with 37 grams of flour. After the syringe  was filled, I replaced the plunger.  6. The solution representing my mucus was prepared using tap water, light corn syrup and unflavored gelatine.  7. Depending on which test, I would applied the correct mucus solution to the testing board  8. The testing board was propped up against the backboard  9. If the test involved the filter, an assistant would stand the filter on the black sharpie line.  10. Then using the syringe I would spray the testing area with the flour.  11. If the test involved the filter, it would gently be removed from the area.  12. Using a metal knife I would collect the flour from the freezer wrap paper.  13. Then I poured the flour back into the syringe and recorded a measurement of how much flour was in the syringe and recorded it.  Then testing was done with the exception of the following steps. Steps 1 and 2 were only done for the first experiment and not repeated. All following experiments began on step 3. Step 6 was not done for the control group. Step 8 was done only with the experiments involving the filter.First Experiment-no mucus with filter  First, I prepared the testing area. The freezer wrap with the measured line was placed on the table. Then the backboard was placed on the freezer wrap paper lining up with the back edge of the freezer wrap paper. The plastic syringe was filled with 37 grams of flour. I applied no snot to the testing board and I stood it up against the backboard. Then my assistant held the filter on the black line which was drawn on the freezer wrap sheet. I sprayed 37 grams of flour to the filter. I then collected the flour from the freezer wrap sheet and measured it. From my measurements, I determined that the filter captured 11 grams of flour and 26 grams of dust was collected from the freezer wrap sheet. Testing area was cleaned for next experiment.Observation: The filter blocked all visible flour! Wow, wasn't expecting it to stop all of it like it did.Second Experiment-no mucus  I prepared the testing area. The freezer wrap with the measured line was placed on the table. Then the backboard was placed on the freezer wrap paper lining up with the back edge of the freezer wrap paper. The plastic syringe was filled with 37 grams of flour. I applied no snot to the testing board and I stood it up against the backboard.I applied no mucus to the testing board and I stood it up against the backboard. The bristles which represented nostril hairs captured some dust. The rest of the dust immediately fell to the freezer wrap sheet. I then collected the flour from the freezer wrap sheet and measured it. From my measurements, I determined that the bristles on my testing board captured 3 grams of flour and 34 grams of dust was collected from the freezer wrap sheet.Observation: I considered this to be an acceptable representation of nostril hairs.Third Experiment-runny mucus with filter  The testing area was prepared and the freezer wrap with the measured line was placed on the table. Then the backboard was placed on the freezer wrap. The dust syringe was prepared with 37 grams of flour. I applied runny mucus to the testing board and then I stood it up against the backboard. Then my assistant held my filter on the black line which was drawn on the freezer wrap sheet. I sprayed 37 grams of flour to the filter. I then collected the flour from the freezer wrap sheet and measured it. From my measurements, I determined that the filter captured 17 grams of flour and 20 grams of dust was collected from the freezer wrap sheet. The testing board was cleaned with water and then dried with a hair drier for the next experiment.Observation: The mucus immediately ran down the testing board with more than half the amount of snot on the sheet.Fourth Experiment-runny snot  The testing area was prepared and the freezer wrap with the measured line was placed on the table. Then the backboard was placed on the freezer wrap sheet. The dust syringe was prepared with 37 grams of flour. I mixed my runny snot solution and applied it to the top area of the testing board and then I stood it up against the backboard. Then dust was applied to the snot. I then collected the flour from the freezer wrap sheet and measured it. From my measurements, I determined that the testing board captured 8 grams of flour and 29 grams of dust was collected from the freezer wrap sheet. Testing area was cleaned for next experiment session.Observation: Once again, most of the mucus immediately ran down the testing board. Since the mucus was runny, it could not capture the dust. From these two experiments, I concluded that there is no way that a runny nose provides much protection for the respiratory system.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 11: Let the Snot Run..."}, {"step": 12, "steps_text": "April 29th, 2014                                                                                                                   Time: 5 hours 20 minutes    12:25 p.m.- 5:15 p.m.     8:30 p.m.- 9:00 p.m. I started the session by re-checking the information from my first group of experiments. After that, I started to brainstorm on ways to pour my slime out of my nose prop during my presentation. I decided to use plastic tubing for a storage area. I injected the slime mixture into my plastic tubing to determine how much tubing I would need to use. I then coiled the tubing and hot glued it together. I also made a stand using popsicle sticks and hot glue. It was made to hold my container of slime which would represent my snot during my presentation. After trial and error, I realized that this would not be feasible to use. So I used a short  piece of a 2\" pvc pipe for a chute. I mounted it on the stand that supported my nose model. During my presentation I would dump different canisters of slime that would slid down the chute and drain while I was talking.Later in the evening, I finished painting my nose prop.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 12: Prop Work...Again"}, {"step": 13, "steps_text": "May 6, 2014                                                                                                                           Time: 2 hours 30 minutes 2:30 p.m. - 5:00 p.m.Fifth Experiment-normal mucus with filter I started the session by mixing my normal mucus so it would have time to set and become the desired mixture. Then I prepared the testing area following the previous procedure listing. I applied  the normal mucus to the testing board and then stood it up against the backboard. My assistant held the filter in front of the testing board. I sprayed 37 grams of flour to the filter. From my measurements, I determined that the filter captured 18 grams of flour and 19 grams of dust was collected from the freezer wrap sheet. After the experiment, I cleaned the testing area and I washed and dried my testing board.Observation:  The result was the same as it was with all my other experiments with the filter.Sixth Experiment-normal mucus without filterI prepared the testing area. I applied the normal mucus to the testing board and I stood it up against the backboard. Then I sprayed the flour on my testing board with the normal mucus. From my measurements, I determined that the testing board captured 25 grams of flour and 12 grams of dust was collected from the freezer wrap sheet.Observation:  I only expected it to capture about half of the flour. The normal mucus laid flat on the testing board without having deep ridges. It was sticky and didn't run down the board, it captured most of the flour out of all my experiments. The mucus held a thin layer of flour all over its surface. Seventh Experiment- Thick mucus with filterI prepared my thick mucus for the experiment and I prepared the testing area.  I applied the thick mucus to the testing board and I stood it up against the backboard. My assistant held the filter in front of my testing board. I sprayed the flour onto the filter. From my measurements, I determined that the filter captured 13 grams of flour and 24 grams of dust was collected from the freezer wrap sheet. Observation:  Once again, the filter blocked the flour and the mucus appeared the same at the end of the experiment compared to how it was when I started the experiment. Eighth Experiment- Thick mucus without filter Testing area was prepared for the next experiment. I prepared my thick mucus for the experiment. I sprayed the flour on the mucus. From my measurements, I determined that the testing board captured 18 grams of flour and 19 grams of dust was collected from the freezer wrap sheet. Observation:  Since the mucus on the testing board had a lot of ridges in it, it held some of the flour in the mucus ridges rather than sticking to the thick mucus. The flour piled onto itself.

A most basic purpose of nose mucus is to protect the respiratory system from foreign objects from entering the respiratory system. Do the different kinds of nose mucus change the filtering capabilities of our nose mucus and what effect does protectant gear have. I hypothesized that different types of mucus\u2019s would capture just as much dust as protectant gear for a nose.To test my hypothesis, I determined that I wanted to use a solution to represent four types of mucus\u2019s and a filter to represent a mask worn over a person\u2019s nose in dusty situations. I established guidelines for all four tests to follow. The filter captured all visible recordable measurements of flour. That led to that set of data that never changed. Each of the four types of mucus\u2019s reacted differently. I concluded from my survey that many people do not understand the importance of mucus. People should use masks or other respiratory gear in any situation where airborne particles are present to help protect the respiratory system by providing another layer of protection.I proved my hypothesis to be wrong. Mucus alone does not protect as well in dusty situations as protectant gear for the nose.IntroductionI hypothesized that different types of mucus\u2019s would capture just as much dust as protectant gear for a nose.While researching a different science project, I came across some basic information concerning the nose and its functions. When it came time to do another project and I began researching various possibilities \u2013 I was still fascinated with the functions of the nose. So I began researching different topics about the nose and its functions.I never realized before how important the mucus in my nose was or what it really did. So I created a survey and distributed to 106 people of various ages. From the answers that were selected, I learned that many people do not understand how important it is to protect their respiratory systems. 52% of the people that were surveyed never use protection in dusty situations. Only 30% of the people used protection sometimes and the smallest group of only 18% protected their noses with protectant gear.I also learned and researched why doctors are always interested in the color of my mucus when I am sick with sinus problems. Various colors present with different possible sicknesses and symptoms so colors can help doctors to identify. With the presentation of my project to various individuals, I hoped to raise awareness about the importance of how their nose mucus works and how extremely important protectant gear is for their respiratory systems. I hope to show them that they cannot depend on their nose mucus to do all the filtering for their bodies in very dusty situations. I want to make people aware that often symptoms such as discoloration in the mucus appear when they do not use protection and it can lead to illness in their respiratory systems.ResultsFirst Experiment-no mucus with filterObservation: The filter blocked all visible flour!

The mucus held a thin layer of flour all over its surface.Seventh Experiment- Thick mucus with filter Observation:Once again, the filter blocked the flour and the mucus appeared the same at the end of the experiment compared to how it was when I started the experiment.Eighth Experiment- Thick mucus without filterObservation: Since the mucus on the testing board had a lot of ridges in it, it held some of the flour in the mucus ridges rather than sticking to the thick mucus. The flour piled onto itself. SummaryBased on my survey questionnaire and the findings from my experiments, I concluded that many people do not understand the importance of mucus. I also determined that people should use masks or other respiratory gear in any situation where airborne particles are present to help the body by providing another layer of protection.I also proved my hypothesis to be wrong. Mucus alone does not protect as well in dusty situations as protectant gear for the nose.In conclusion, mucus plays a big part in the health of our body. Mucus was designed by God to protect our respiratory system from harmful invaders. So just remember, mucus may be gross, but it\u2019s snot a bad thing. ReferencesBone Up on Boogers. (n.d.).

That\u2019s so gross!\u201d This is the most common remark people say concerning snot or what is known as mucus from the nose. Mucus plays a very important roll in the healthy function of our bodies. Its flushing protection is kind of a garbage removal. The color of our snot shows us just what kind of garbage it\u2019s helping remove.Most doctors and scientists agree that the basic purpose of nose mucus is to protect our respiratory system from foreign objects such as bacteria, viruses, grains of dust, pollen and other unwanted invaders from entering our respiratory system. Snot takes these invaders back out our noses or down into our stomachs.Does the kind of nose mucus really make a difference? Does using protectant gear really assist our nose mucus in protecting our bodies? I hypothesized that different types of mucus\u2019s would capture just as much dust as protectant gear for a nose.I prepared a survey before I did my experiments and distributed them to a large variety of people. I wanted to compare my survey results against my test results. I began exploring different ways to prove my hypothesis. I determined that I wanted to test four types of mucus:  runny, normal, thick and no mucus. I also wanted to use a filter to represent a mask that would be worn over a person\u2019s nose in dusty situations. I determined that in my experiments color would not be a factor.I established guidelines for all four tests to follow. Each test involved 2 experiments-one with a filter and one without a filter. Next, I designed a testing area that would be the same for all eight experiments. I set up my experiment area as shown in my photos. I used the same procedures when I collected, measured and recorded the dust that was not captured by the filter or the different kinds of mucus.It was very difficult to find slime recipes that represented the three kinds of mucus. Through trial and error I chose a recipe that consisted of tap water, unflavored gelatin and light corn syrup. In my experiments the mucus would be the only variable that would change.I began my testing with the control group that did not have a mucus solution. I realized two things with my test. In the first experiment the filter blocked all of the flour. In the second experiment the bristles that represented nose hair functioned like the real thing. In each of the following experiments the nose hair followed the same pattern with holding the mucus in place and helping to capture dust.After all my experiments were finished I compared my results and observations. I was surprised to find that the filter captured all recordable measurements of flour. That led to that set of data that never changed. The runny nose was not effective because the mucus was not in the nose long enough to capture any flour. The normal mucus had a layer of flour across all of its surface. Most of the flour in the thick snot was captured in the ridges rather than on its surface.In my research, I learned that clear or slightly yellow mucus indicates a healthy nose. Dr. Harry Malech from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases explains that green mucus receives its coloring from iron found in an enzyme that might indicate a bacterial infection. Rusty colored mucus can be a sign of bleeding from an airway.  And last, mucus that is dark colored can be dust and dirt that was captured in the mucus. Based on my survey questionnaire and the findings from my experiments, I concluded that many people do not understand the importance of mucus. I also determined that people should use masks or other respiratory gear in any situation where airborne particles are present to help the body by providing another layer of protection. I also proved my hypothesis to be wrong. Mucus alone does not protect as well in dusty situations as protectant gear for the nose.In conclusion, mucus plays a big part in the health of our body.

Our wearable device which measures pulses and facilitating technologies that takes different muscular activities as their input. But our system comprises use of all three systems through use of biomedical techniques such as electromyography, electroencephalography and pulse sensors. Electromyography (EMG) is a used for evaluating and recording the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles. The rhythm of heartbeat obtained due to artery dilation. Pulse can be used to determine the blood pressure and measured by feeling the arteries of the wrist or neck. Electroencephalography (EEG) is the recording of electrical activity along the scalp. EEG measures voltage fluctuations resulting from ionic current flows within the neurons of the brain.Person has to wear these instruments in an unnoticeable way through which they can be monitored. For example brain wave sensors can be introduced in hair bands and pulse sensors at wearable band that makes them feel comfortable to use. Brain waves are considered as a secondary factor to ensure whether the person is in danger or not.  If it reaches a saturation limit measurement values will be identified by Intel Edison development Board, under such situation current location will be tracked by GSM/GPS device will transmit the panic situation information to their concerned persons (relatives or police station).

Dissolve 1 tablespoon of soft soap in one litre (\u00bc gallon) of approximately 50 \u00b0C (122 \u00b0F) water.When felting, it's best to work with your entire hand as much as possible. Felt the basic shape with your flat hand and no pressure at all \u2013 no more than a gentle vibrating over the surface of the wool. The shape of the animal is not hugely important at this stage.Felting is complete when the entire surface is connected evenly together and to the wool below.

Slowly work from the outside-middle of the plug outward, creating a deep trench in a ring around the middle of the plug. Once you have a fairly deep ring around the middle, smooth out the sides so that the plug flares out from the middle to the edges seamlessly. Use your Dremel to make nice, rounded edges on the ends of each plug. Work the tool around inside the tunnel if you have room--if not, roll up a little piece of sandpaper and rotate that around inside the tunnel of your plug to make sure everything is uniform in color.

Each fiber of wool has scales along it that catch on the scales of other wool strands causing them to become permanently tangled.  In this tutorial I am using 2 different needles, I'm going to explain why I select and use each of them. The crown point needle is one of my favorites. It has 3 barbs that are right at the tip of the needle. It's triangular in shape, so each barb is placed along one edge of the needle. I prefer doing most of my work with this needle because it only felt a few fiber as a time. It does felt slower than other needles with more barbs but it gives you greater control when shaping a 3d felted piece. The reason that it give you more control is that it essentially felts the inside of a ball of wool while leaving the surface mostly un-felted. This allows you more chances to move or reshape wool than using other needles and it also gives you a firmly felted piece.The star point needle, which in this tutorial is a finer gauged needle has multiple barbs along it's four sided star shaped needle. These extend from the tip up a good distance as you can see in the photo. The barbs are also staggered. This needle felts wool very quickly. This can be a good thing, but it can also cause problems if you want a firmly felted piece in the end. Because it grabs many layers of fiber it tends to felt the surface of a piece while missing the center of piece, which can result in a squish-able animal, or caricature. It's star shape however tends to not leave a noticeable hole in a finished piece which is why I use it for finishing the surface and use the crown point needle for felting the structure. Tips on shaping:When working with wool I basically always start with a ball of wool. Then I Roll it to elongate it into a coil, or flatten it to make a flat piece, or keep rolling it to make a sphere. It's important to remember not to felt one area more than another so always turn a piece and move your needle.Needle direction (or angling) is also important. Your needle is dragging wool in the direction you're stabbing the wool. It's much the same as pushing clay. So keep in mind where you want the fibers to go when you're felting them. If you want them to go in and to the center of a piece then you want you needle straight up and down. If your felting a curve then you want to follow the shape of that curve with your needle. If at any time you get lost, press into the wool with your finger and see how your finger alters the shape. If that's what you want then mimic that push of your finger with your felting needle. Right, so I can't think of anything else to tell you about needle felting, other than it's a very fun and relaxing hobby that I'd suggest everyone try at least once. Hopefully I've covered the important bits.

Then take the roving which is mostly straight and mix the fibers up so that they look like the second photo.

There is really only one step to this process, Roll the wool between your hands then stab your needle into it, over and over again, turning regularly and felting all sides.

To do that you simply felt the sides, pushing gently with your finger to help shape the wool more quickly. Then felt the flat bottom, then felt the top. Try to follow the curve with your needle so that the wool is being pushed towards the center. So by follow the curve I mean that your needle would be straight up and down at the top center, and then as you progress down the right side of the curve your needle end would tip to your right, where as the left side, your needle base (not tip) would tilt towards the left, Again you just repeat the 3 steps above. sides, turning regularly so that the entire area is covered, the flat base, and the top. Remember to keep using your crown point needle, this leaves the surface bubbly looking like in the last photo, but you'll feel the needle resisting as in enters the center of your wool shape. Never force the needle through a piece as that can cause the needle to break, and keep an eye on your fingers. Felting needles tear the skin so it'll be very painful if you stab yourself. Hold the needle gently between your fingers so that if it gets stuck it slips upward as your hand moves down.The sides:Now in the first photo you can see that I'm pushing down with my finger, and angling the needle to my left. the reason for this is that I'm trying to elongate the wool while still shrinking it down and in. If my needle was at a sharper angle I'd be moving the wool even more to the left side. The bottomIn the fourth photo you can see that I'm pushing straight down into the wool. This is the flat bottom side, going straight down and in means that you will just shrink it in the direction your needle is traveling. it's somewhat round, so you're needle will go round a circle, don't forget to get close to the edge on the bottom. You can round the edge up into the body as your shaping the sides of the body, I usually start at the center and felt down until it's mostly flat as it begins pretty rounded, then I felt outward to the edge. Always move your needle to a different spot though, don't just felt in one single location over and over again. The top:Here I'm rounding the top keeping it mostly spherical. In the fifth photo above you can see that I'm angling my needle to match the curve, At the very top my needle would be straight up and down, so as I move to the sides I want to angle the needle, following the curve, which is what you're seeing in the photo. Just to reiterate you felt the sides, rolling it across the sponge as you do,(felting all sides), then you felt the bottom, then the top, and repeat until your wool has shrunk to about 1 1/2 inches and is somewhat firm to the touch when you squeeze it while still springing back out when you stop squeezing it.

If you want to measure you can cut a length of roving 3 1/4 inch long, then split it in half. Then take one of the two strands you have now, and split it in half again. I actually used a bit of scrap wool that I had from another project, but normally I would measure it out like this. I'd keep the other 1/4 of the roving for the belly later on. In the first photo with the dark brown wool I'm demonstrating how you split the roving in half by just pulling it apart from the top down.Or you can guesstimate the amount of wool that you'll need, if you end up with too much you can always cut some of the wool away, or if you end up with too little you can always add a bit more. guessing generally results in something that is unique and one of a kind. For the face I used a pinch of wool fiber I had left over from another project. The second and third photo demonstrate the amount I used. If your guesstimating like I did then use the body piece as a guide, the loose ball of fiber is about half as tall as the body piece. Once I have my fibers rolled in a loose ball I flatten this ball onto the brush. I usually push it down so the brush grabs it then gentle roll it in circles against the palm of my other hand. I couldn't take a photo of this process because it would require I have three hands or a camera that would attach to my tripod. If you don't have a brush just flatten the ball between both hands and gently move them in a circle, it gives you the same flattened sphere at the end. Before removing it you'll want to stab your felting needle into a few times, not too many times, just enough to help the fibers stick together, so you can control them more easily. Take this flattened disc and carefully fold loose fibers from the top edge under just a bit, then lay it down onto the body piece and using your crown point needle felt it together. Stick close to the top as much as you can, you do not want to attach the bottom at all. make a notch at the top by using you needle to just grab the light brown wool and push it down. The sixth photo shows this, my needle is basically flat again the body, only grabbing the  light brown wool. Once you have a dip between the eyes that you are happy with, attach the top part. Make sure that you focus on the edge and then down to about the halfway point. In the photos above you can see I felted one side first and then the other. If you have loose fibers on the edges that you want to tame, use the tip of your needle to push them away from you, then insert the needle along the edge into the body, this makes the needle catch onto the fibers you've pushed away from you and drag them into the body of the felt. I usually tame the edge later on, as you can see in the final photo.Felt until both eyes are done and about half of the face is finished. The last photo has a note that describes the are of the face you want to felt. The body is laid sideways so the top of the body is on the right of the photo. The fibers at the bottom are still loose.

Felt each ball using your crown point needle. Roll it and stab it, every direction. The third photo shows how they look after being felted just a bit with the crown point needle. Don't felt them too much, you mostly just want to tack the fibers into a sphere so that they are easier to manage while still leaving some loose bits. Then you attach the arms and legs and felt them together, focusing on the edges where the leg meets the body and then the center of the spherical leg. Use your star needle for this as it will be easier than felting with the crown point into the body. The photos show you the areas you want to focus on but remember to felt the entire surface of each arm and leg, dragging your wool down and into the body so they are well attached. Repeat this until you have all four legs attached to the body, as you can see I have one arm on the top of the last photo that is higher than the others, this gives it character, you want them close to the same, but minor mistakes can add to the end design. One arm up makes it look like it's waving at you.Also note that the second to last photo you can see the needle going completely through the arm. you'll want to do this from all sides of each arm., Getting at the sides can be difficult when the other arms are attached to the body so keep that in mind.

I ended up having more fiber than I needed, which isn't a problem as you'll see.Once you've flattened you ball of wool into a disc like shape you want to attach it, starting right under the chine, make sure you leave a line of dark brown wool between the belly and the face. Work from the top down towards the bottom, using your needle to move the light brown wool where you want it to be attached. Again pay careful attention to your edged. Once I reached the bottom and could see that I had too much wool I decided to cut it off. Cutting it wasn't absolutely necessary I could have also made the character have a fat belly by doing the same thing I did with the snout (nose) part of the face. I didn't want him to have a really big belly though and I wanted to show you how you can remove excess wool. In the last two photo I swept the tip of the needle from the outside edges in towards the center. I'm using the needle to move the fibers, and the stabbing into the body to secure them. This technique is useful  to master as it give you wonderful control over even the tiniest bits of fiber.Continue felting the belly until it's firmly attached and there are no loose little bits of fiber sticking up on your edges. Also don't forget that you want to felt the dark brown a bit around the belly, if you ignore the dark wool you will find that you have a noticeable dip where one bit of wool meets another, but by felting both at the edges you avoid this happening.

Don't use too little wool, for something like a tail you can remove excess fiber using scissors easier than you can add it. I wanted the tail to be about the length of my thumb nail so I made a coil that was about three times that and about just more than half the width of my nail. If you go back to step 10 you can see the coil in relation to the body. Basically if you want a longer tail make a longer coil if you want a thicker tail add more wool to it.To make the coil or snake.This is exactly the same way you would work clay, start with a ball and then take the finger tips of both hands with the wool between them and drag the finger tips of one hand down towards your palm, rolling the wool between your fingers as you go. Then bring the other hand down the opposite direction. repeat this a few times using gentle pressure.Once you have your coil of wool you want to begin felting it in the middle using your crown point needle. Do NOT felt either edge, leave the fibers at both ends loose. as you can see in the photos this causes it to look u shaped because the fiber in the center is being forced into the coil but the ends aren't worked at all and are still fluffy. Roll this and work the center out to the ends for the length you want the tail to be. Then take the fiber from one end and use your needle to push the fiber away from you and then stab it into the center of your coil. This is a lot like the bottom of the body, just keep dragging your fibers into the center of your coil until you have a somewhat round edge as seen in the fifth photo. Then turn it and work on the sides of the coil again, working down to the very tip while still keeping the bottom fibers free and loose. Again turn the piece regularly and felt from the right (the tip) to the very base, then roll it on your surface and felt  from tip to base again. You want to keep felting When it becomes difficult to work with the crown point needle switch to your star needle. You want to felt the tail really well before attaching it to the body. If you notice the last photo I wanted to demonstrate the point at which the fibers become loose and un-felted, if you take your needle or your finger and push down you will find that it's firm up until you reach the loose fibers at which point the needle can completely compress them down. This photo is meant to demonstrate and remind you that you want to keep the base fibers loose. So focus on the tip and length of the tail more as you are felting the tail. This actually doesn't take very long to make because it is so small. If you are having difficulties holding something tiny and not stabbing into your fingers you can always use another felting needle to hold it in place, or even a pen or something similar. My fingers aren't very big so I find it easy to work small things but most people don't. Just take your time and move slowly when doing a smaller piece.

Then work out from the center felting the black wool onto the surface focus on the edge again, you want to insert the needle right where one color meets the other so that half the needles barbs are catching one color and half is catching the other. This is seen in the third photo. I usually stab the center into place and attach both eyes and then felt one and then the other. In the photos above I didn't take photos of the left eye, so if you look closely you can see that the edges of the wool on the left are not well defined. If you want larger eyes you can use more wool and attach it to a wider area, if you want smaller eyes use less wool to start with. If you have a stray bit of fiber that's sticking straight up away from the center of the eye, that's really long, you can trim it with your scissors. It's hard to tame long ends for such a small area, you can avoid having this happen by making sure your little balls of wool are tightly compressed and rolled until no fibers escape the ball before attaching them.

NOTE: You will be using the neck area a lot for inserting the needle...this will hide all the ugly knots (etc) from the base of the thread. 4. Push the needle through the exact area you just went through, then wrap the thread nearest the needle around the needle tip roughly 3 times in a counter-clockwise motion, then pull the needle the rest of the way through again. This will create a nice knot to hold it all in place. Important NOTE: the counter-clockwise technique of wrapping the thread around the needle to create a knot, I will be calling \"needle wrapping\" for the rest of the 'ible. Whenever you read \"needle wrapping\" or \"needle wrap\", do exactly what you just did in #4 to secure the spot you're in. Sometimes this will be accompanied with pushing the needle through a wrapped piece of thread to give it something to \"hold\" on to. 5. Pull the string from this position down along the designated backside of your baby (where a butt crack would be). From the middle of the seamed base, to the middle of the neck area. 6. Insert your needle somewhere along this line of string and go upwards to the middle area of the seam (where you already were). Needle wrap before you pull the needle all the way through to secure it. 7. As you pull the needle through, tug a little bit on the thread (pulling a little tighter than usual) to give it shape like a little bottom. 8. Go one more time in the spot in the middle of the seam, and back up toward the middle of the neck, and pull the thread taut.

The first thing to do is get moving to put that heart into high gear. As your body needs more oxygen to its muscles, the heart beats faster to circulate it. After 30 seconds of hopping around, it's time to check those arteries for a pulse. The circulatory system is one big loop with many branches. We describe the tracks as veins (blood going to heart) and arteries (blood going away). A way I help students remember is that the heart thinks it's the most important organ in the body, so everything going to it is a \"vein\" because it's \"vain.\" To feel our pulse, check one of the easy arteries and hold for 30 seconds. You can do the radial artery (inside the wrist), the carotid artery (on the neck), or simply feel your chest. What does your heart sound like? How fast is it beating? What's the pattern?A few students may be able to detect the WUMP-wump, WUMP-wump part of the beat (which they've probably heard in movies, too).

There is also an inferior vena cava (which is often chopped off) that brings blood from the lower half of your body. The aorta is an artery that takes blood from your heart and pumps it through back toward your body. You can see these are thick as they are dealing with a lot of force. See where they lead. Often in the front, you'll simply find two tubes without flaps which are the pulmonary veins and arteries. First, blood comes in from the vena cava on the right ventricle, then gets pumped out the pulmonary artery. After getting oxygen, it returns through the pulmonary vein, and then back out to the body.

Then, open up the System Preferences app on your Mac and go to Bluetooth. Wait until the Sphero shows up in the list and click the \"Pair\" button next to it.Now, find the port the Sphero is connected. Open up your Terminal app, and typels -a /dev | grep tty.Sphero. It should result in a line that looks like/dev/tty.Sphero-YRO-AMP-SPP(it will probably be slightly different for your particular Sphero). Copy that line to the clipboard.Open the eyerobot software. It should look like a browser window with a purple eye background. Click \"Configure\" on the main screen. Change the \"Sphero port\" field to match what you found in Terminal. \"Pupil surface\" is the name the Pupil tracker will use to represent your screen. We just decided to call it \"screen\".

Click \"Save\". Then, press Back.On the main screen again, press \"Start\". Change the video feed in the drop down list to the webcam you plugged in. It will usually be called something like \"USB Camera\". The webcam needs to have a good, clear, horizontal view of the floor. This can usually be accomplished by hanging it on an object like a tripod. You can verify the camera's view by looking at the video feed in eyerobot.Now, open the ball tracker program. In terminal, writepython BallTracker.py. It will ask for a video source ID. That determines which of the cameras the ball tracker will use to look for the Sphero. This is usually the same source ID used in the eyerobot program. If everything is working correctly, it will display a window with a blue-and-red dot at the center of the detected Sphero.The last step is to calibrate Pupil. Place the Pupil headset on your head and open the Pupil capture app. Two windows should open, one for the world camera and one for the eye camera. Make sure the eye camera has a good view of your eye; you can check by going to the eye camera window and making sure there is an outline around your pupil with a red dot in the center. If there are eyelashes blocking the camera, you might need to turn off the \"coarse detection\" in the Pupil window.Next, you will need to add the computer screen as a surface to Pupil. This will allow Pupil to report the position of your eye gaze on the screen. To do this, open eyerobot and make it full-screen so that the four QR-code-like markers on the corner of the screen are visible in the world camera. Then, in pupil, press the \"A\" (Add Surface) button to add it as a tracked surface. Finally, rename the surface to whatever you chose in the eyerobot configuration.The last step is to calibrate the eye tracker. This lets the program know which eye gaze position corresponds to which real-world location. Calibration is really simple. Just press the \"C\" (Calibration) button in the same column you clicked the Add Surface button, and look at the targets as they come up! There are a total of 9 targets.That's it! You're all done.

The thick wire is more durable, being protected by a thicker outer plastic core, but it cannot be bent as tightly and may not be suitable for designs with fine details or sharp bends.\rColors:\rThere are two standard phosphor colors for EL wire:  aqua blue (which is white with a clear sheath when off), and white (which is pink when off, due to the addition of a red phosphor in the mix).  The other colors (pink, red, orange, yellow, lime green, dark green, dark blue, and violet) are achieved by filtering the aqua light through a tinted outer sheath.  Aqua tends to be the brightest, although the brightness can be adjusted when you select your driver.\rEL Drivers:\rEL wire uses a high voltage and high frequency alternating current to activate the phosphor.  An EL driver, also known as an inverter, is required to convert your low voltage DC power from the battery into a high voltage AC source.

The polarity does not matter - either wire can be connected to the center core or the outer wires.  There are many methods for soldering EL wire, for any of these you should end up with a reinforced region with heat shrink tubing covering the junction.I strongly recommend that you test the wire at this stage, joining the two conductors to an inverter,  before it is attached to the garment.  This is also a good time to join the pieces together to test the overall brightness, and decide whether you'd like to use a stronger inverter.  You can achieve a higher level of brightness by overdriving the wire (e.g., attaching a short length of wire to one that is designed for a longer piece).  It will burn out the phosphor on the wire faster, but that might not be important for some applications.

Look for the basic clear kind, in one of the lower weights. I typically use the 6lb type, but 4lb and 8lb will also work reasonably well.  You can also use standard thread, if you don't mind that it will block light from the EL wherever you make a stitch.\rMake a hole in the fabric where you want to have an entry point.  with the connector wires on the inside, pull the EL wire through the hole.  When you get to the solder junction and shrink tubing, leave that part inside the garment and position it in a way that can be reinforced.  For example, you may want to sew it to the inside of a seam, or add glue.  It is most important that the area inside the shrink tubing is not going to bend repeatedly - this is the most fragile part of the wire.\rIf you are doing the type of installation where you are running one long piece along an arm or leg, or another line that is going to extend when you flex, then it is better to mount the EL wire in a way that allows the end to slide slightly in and out of the hole.\rTo sew the wire in place:  use a needle that is appropriate for the garment fabric (leather needles have a special piercing point at the end).  Thread the needle.  As a rule of thumb, a good amount of thread to use is the distance between your hands when your arms are spread out.  Shorter pieces will require frequent re-threading, longer pieces tend to get tangled and caught on things.  I like to sew with a double strand of thread - meaning the needle is positioned at the halfway point on the piece of fishing line, and the two ends are tied together.  A double knot is a good idea.\rWhen you start sewing, run the needle between the two threads after the first stitch, to make a better anchor to the knot.  This ensures the the knot will not pull through the hole in the fabric.\rSew along the length of the EL wire with a diagonal whip stitch, using whatvever spacing is needed to hold the wire in the proper shape.  If the fabric is especially thick or difficult to sew through, you can use a line of topstitching as your anchor.  \rTie an extra knot in the fishing line periodically (every 5-6 inches), so that if part of it breaks it will not undo the rest of the stitching.\rFor some materials, a strong flexible glue may be a better choice.  For example, EL wire can be mounted to a plastic surface (such as a helmet) by hot glue, E6000, or 3M Super Strength Adhesive.\rAnother method for attaching EL wire to clothing is to make a casing or channel with sheer fabric, and slide the wire through there.  \rOr, if you're looking for an extremely easy short cut, or a quick temporary attachment, you could weave it back and forth through holes in the fabric, or hold it on temporarily with safety pins, zip ties, or clear tape.\rWhen you get to the other end, make an entry hole, if needed.  Leave about 2-3\" excess wire at the end.  Seal the end with heat-shrink tubing and/or glue, and mount it on the inside of the garment, as you did with the leading end.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2Z/35S4/FHOHI6CJ/F2Z35S4FHOHI6CJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FT3/NFE8/FHOHI6CI/FT3NFE8FHOHI6CI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVU/8SJ0/FHOHI6CH/FVU8SJ0FHOHI6CH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVU/UTB2/FHOHI6CG/FVUUTB2FHOHI6CG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Attach the EL Wire"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "First, you will need to deal with wire management inside the garment. There should be enough slack for the non-glowing connector wires to reach back to the inverter and battery without being pulled tightly when you move.  But, you also don't want so much excess wire that it will get snagged when you put it on.  I recommend using a big stitch to sew these wires to the seams on the inside of the garment.  If your jacket is unlined, this is especially helpful.  If your jacket has a lining, it may be sufficient to make some anchor points at key locations where the wire bends, like the armpits.\rAfter all the wires running back to the inverter and battery pocket are stabilized, reconnect them as needed.  They can be hard-wired to the driver, or joined to a plug if you want it to be easy to change it later.  Use heat-shrink tubing or other insulators to ensure that you do not short out the two conductors to each other.\rAdvice for the battery pocket:\rUse an existing pocket in the garment or add one, if necessary.  The pocket should be close to the size of the battery pack.  If you will be dancing or moving a lot in the coat, you don't want the battery pack to bounce around too much, or fall out.  Closing the pocket with a zipper or velcro can be helpful.\rClip a small part of the pocket seam, pass the wire through, and re-sew the seam closed so that the parts don't fall back into the lining.  If you do not plan to change the inverter, that part can be hidden in an inaccessible part inside the lining, or sewn into a separate closed section of a pocket.  Run the wire for the battery connector to that pocket.  There should be enough excess wire to easily access the end and change batteries.\rMany EL drivers run on 9V or 12V.  A standard 9V battery is good for many applications.  If you want longer battery life with a 9V system, you can also use a 6-pack of AA cells.  \r", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FT3/NFE8/FHOHI6CI/FT3NFE8FHOHI6CI.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Finishing Steps"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "In addition to lighting up the seams of a garment, EL wire can also be bent into shape to create logos and other designs, and sewn or glued to fabric.

The top and bottom sheets are alike. So choose one as the bottom and start assembling the 3d printed parts one by one as shown in the pictures. Assemble both sheets side by side so that later we can just sandwich the mirrors and lens in between. As all parts are symmetrical it's easy to assembly them. Look at the optics box assembly file on meshmixer before assembling to get the overview.Start with fixing the lens holder on the bottom sheet. The cut portion of the holder should come towards the central groove as shown in the pictures. Place the sheet on a flat surface and place the lens holder in the front groove. Apply a thin layer of glue with a glue gun on the edges as shown in the picture. Do this on the top sheet as well. For the mirrors they all are similar so fix them into their grooves and apply glue on edges. If you notice the optics box assembly it consists of temporary joints so that we can tweak into the box whenever we face some focusing issue with the camera and also holds the setup very intact. Handling the Optics Wear disposable plastic gloves while handling the optics. Hold them in between the thumb finger and the index finger at their edges. On the bottom sheet holders place the lens in the lens holder such that the tapered surfaces mate one another. Remove the protective layer from the mirrors before installation. Orient the front reflective surfaces of one mirror towards the lens and other mirror's reflective surface facing this. Place them carefully in their holders. Now sandwich the lens and mirrors with the top sheet. Secure the setup by gently pressing at top and bottom. Take the the two side holders and fix them at the sides. Take the back cover and fix it. The whole box will stay in place because of the fittings. See that the hole at the back plate comes at the empty space. The whole assembly can be best visualized in the 3D cad model. Fixing the LED'sTake the back sheet. Orient the LED holder with the holes on the back sheet then pass M2x16mm bolts through each hole. Hold it there like that. There would be extra 4 holes that are for the wires to pass. Take a 2 pin female connector. On the top holes pass the red and black wires through each one.

Take your pick... Some people like to make their Halloween decorations from papier mache. We used raw, bleeding pig's hearts! Last year, we tried to decellularize some chicken hearts and gizzards at BioCurious for Halloween. This year, we tackled a full-size pig heart, with members of Counter Culture Labs, our new DIYbio group in the SF East Bay, with some help from friends at BioCurious. Decellularization is a tissue engineering technique designed to strip out all the cells from a donor organ, leaving nothing but the connective tissue that used to hold the cells in place. This scaffold of connective tissue - called a \"ghost organ\" for its pale and almost translucent appearance - can then be reseeded with a patient's own cells, with the goal of regenerating an organ that can be transplanted into the patient without fear of tissue rejection. A decellularized mouse heart regenerated with human heart precursor cells will actually start beating autonomously! Here's some amazing videos on this work by Doris Taylor at U. Minnesota:Creating a beating heart in the labSurprising Beauty, Holding A Pig's Heart Getting all the cells to coordinate correctly in a large heart is still a big challenge. That part is still years away from clinical use. We're just doing the first part though: decellularization of a pig heart. Why? Well, what self-respecting mad scientist wouldn't want to have a Ghost Heart in a Jar! If any of this seems way too challenging to you - note that none of us had ever done anything like this before! We just read up on what it took to do this, figured out where to get a pig heart, got a few pieces of equipment, ordered some chemicals, and got to it! The results look absolutely spectacular, and we learned tons along the way. Yes, this project is a bit complex, and there's lots of long words in the steps below - but don't let that scare you away! The whole thing can be accomplished in a single day, and we'll tell you about DIY alternatives for all the equipment and chemicals used here. The decellularization is achieved using enzymes and detergents to break open the cells and flush out the cellular content. The solutions need to be perfused throughout the heart muscle using a pump. Not just through the chambers of the heart, mind you, but actually through the coronary arteries that provide blood supply to the muscle of the heart itself. The published protocol takes approximately 10 hours, but since we are planning this as a show piece and not to reseed them with cells, we have taken some shortcuts. Please use appropriate safety equipment and measures. One of the nice aspects of this experiment is that all the chemicals you're working with are fairly non-toxic. But you're also working with lots of fluids under pressure, and you really, really don't want assorted pig heart juices squirting into your eyes - trust me on that! So make sure to wear some goggles at least. A lab coat to protect your clothes from giant blood stains wouldn't hurt either (unless you're into that kinda thing). If you use something like an aquarium pump please note the problems the solutions used could cause the pump, as well as contamination issues. A fountain pump from the hardware store might be another interesting alternative for high volume and relative high pressure. But most fountain pumps are immersion pumps, and are *not* designed to handle salty, conductive water - try at your own risk!

However, hearts that have been butchered for food typically have the arteries at the top of the heart cut off, and a slash through the chambers of the heart to let the blood drain out. Unfortunately, that makes them entirely unsuited for what we need. What you need is a pig heart that has been butchered specifically for biological experiments - what's called a \"bio-heart\" in the trade. The good folks at the California Academy of Sciences recommended C&M Meat Company, a meat wholesaler in Berkeley that should be able to get us a bio-heart fairly cheap. Unfortunately, when you're trying to get a single heart from a wholesaler... you're not exactly a high priority for them. They agreed to get us some bio-hearts, but only if we ordered at least five at a time. So after getting the runaround and wasting a couple more weeks of our time, we finally received a surprisingly neat cardboard box, containing five very raw, and very bloody pig hearts! Our bio-hearts came with about a foot or more of extra arteries attached. You'll need no more than about an inch of the aorta to attach a hose for the perfusion, so you may want to chop off some of the obviously extraneous bits at this point. While you're at it, rinse the heart under tap water to get rid of blood that might be left in the chambers, check that the aorta is intact, and that there aren't any nicks on the surface of the heart muscle. The first step in almost all decellularization protocols is to freeze the organ. That's partly for convenience, but the formation of ice crystals will also start breaking open the cells, starting the decellularization. So wrap your bio-hearts in separate plastic bags, chuck them in the freezer, and above all - don't tell your vegetarian wife!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FGT/DH7A/HNM4GE03/FGTDH7AHNM4GE03.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F42/Y70N/HNM4GE02/F42Y70NHNM4GE02.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Obtain a Pig \"bio-heart\""}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "\n          Lots of technical details here - feel free to skip ahead! This paper has a good overview of the various methods used for tissue decellularization:An overview of tissue and whole organ decellularization processes We actually have two different variations of the pig heart protocol: the one originally published by Wainwright et al in their 2010 paper, and the modified protocol from the 2012 video in the Journal of Visualized Experiments, by the same group. Both versions start with freezing at -80C and then thawing the heart, to help break up cells. Wainwright et al paper:    Perfuse 3L Type 1 reagent grade water for 15min at 1L/min, then 2xPBS (phosphate buffered saline) for 15min at 1L/min     Perfuse 0.02% trypsin / 0.05% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid / 0.05% NaN3 at 37C for 2h at 1 L/min     Perfuse Type 1 water for 5min, then 2xPBS for 15min     Perfuse 3% Triton X-100 / 0.05% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid / 0.05% NaN3 for 2h at 1.3L/min     Perfuse Type 1 water for 5min, then 2xPBS for 15min     Perfuse 4% deoxycholic acid solution for 2h at 1.3L/min     Perfuse Type 1 water for 5min, then 2xPBS for 15min     Perfuse 0.1% peracetic acid / 4% ethanol for 1h at 1.7L/min     Perfuse with PBS twice, and Type 1 water three times, 15min each at 1.7L/min  If you add everything together, this protocol takes about 10 hours from start to finish for all the perfusion steps. The modified version from the Jove video goes through much the same steps, lengthening the trypsin and deoxycholic acid treatment to 3h, and the detergent treatment to 2.5h, for a total time of around 13 hours perfusion! They also ramp the perfusion speed from 400ml/min for the initial water perfusion, to 2.2L/min for the deoxycholic and subsequent steps. In our case, we only had about 10 hours total to accomplish this, and we wound up spending a good amount of that time testing out the pump, fixing leaks in the connections, dissecting down the heart etc. So we wound up adjusting the durations to fit into the time remaining. On the other hand, since we were making a showpiece rather than a ghost heart that could be successfully reseeded with stem cells, we knew we could easily cheat on some of the ingredients. In particular, we used plain tap water instead of gallons and gallons of expensive \"Type 1\" reagent grade water. Likewise, we just used plain kitchen salt in tap water instead of phosphate buffered saline. We used OxyClean (sodium percarbonate) instead of peracetic acid, and 151-proof Everclear instead of reagent grade ethanol for the final disinfection step. We also wanted to use SDS rather than Triton X-100 as the detergent, since SDS tends to whiten the tissue better (at the expense of being somewha harsher on the extracellular matrix). We didn't have quite enough SDS, so we wound up going with 2% SDS / 1% Triton X-100. We also left out the sodium azide (NaN3), which is there to inhibit bacterial growth, but is also very toxic - something we'd rather not mess with in a DIY setting. Oh, and we didn't have access to a high-volume peristaltic pump, but we did have a Bio-Rad Buffer Recirculation Pump (see http://www.bio-rad.com/webroot/web/pdf/lsr/literature/M1702929C.pdf\u200e) that can theoretically do up to 1.5L/min. Not intended to supply the kind of pressures we need, but meh - let's just see what happens... So here's what we wound up with in the end:    Perfuse 3L tapwater for 15min, then high saline (50g kitchen salt in 3L tapwater) for 15min     Perfuse 0.02% trypsin / 0.05% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid at 37C for 1.5h     Perfuse tapwater for 10min, then high saline for 10min     Perfuse 2% SDS / 1% Triton X-100 for 50min     Perfuse tapwater for 5min, then high saline for 5min     Perfuse 2.5% deoxycholic acid (25g in 1L) for 20min     Perfuse tapwater for 5min, then high saline for 5min     Perfuse 0.5% OxyClean / 4% ethanol for 1h at 1.7L/min     Perfuse saline (25g in 3L), then tap water for 5min     Let drain, then stuff into Ikea jar with 151 proof Everclear!

The \"bio-hearts\" didn't merely have an intact aorta - they had about a foot of arteries and other gristly stuff attached. So our first task was to dissect all that down. Luckily, at least one of us had some experience doing dissections... the vegan! The technique we're using here to push fluids through the heart muscle is called retrograde coronary perfusion. Interestingly, this same technique can also be used in what's called a Langendorff preparation to keep a beating heart alive, by pumping nutrient-rich oxygenated fluids through it. The reason it's called \"retrograde\" is because you push fluids into the aorta, whereas in normal operation, blood comes out of the aorta. Essentially, we're hacking the cardiac system, taking advantage of a peculiarity of the heart's plumbing! Normally, oxygen rich blood comes from the lungs into the left atrium, from which it is pumped through the aortic valve, into the aorta, and then from there to feed the rest of the body. But the very first thing that gets fed by this freshly oxygenated blood is the heart muscle itself, through two coronary arteries located just above the aortic valve (see the schematic above). Now, when we push fluids retrograde into the aorta, that pressure will cause the aortic valve to close, and the only place for that fluid to go is through the coronary arteries into the heart muscle - cool, no? After separating the aorta cleanly from the pulmonary artery and trimming it down a bit (to just below the brachiocephalic artery, the smaller artery connecting to the aorta closest to the heart), we inserted a brass barbed hose connector into the aorta (5/8\" into the aorta, to 1/2\" for the tubing) and tightened it securely with a wide hose clamp. But apparently not tightly enough, since we accidentally pulled it out a couple steps later... After connecting the 1/2\" vinyl tubing to the heart and the pump and tightening all the connectors with hose clamps, we lowered the heart into 3 liters of tap water in a giant 4 liter beaker, turned on the pump - and discovered we had sprung a leak! Apparently our butcher wasn't too careful and put a tiny nick in one of the small arteries on the surface of the heart, through which a lot of our pressurized water was now escaping... Remembering that superglue (cyanoacrylate) has been used to replace stitches in surgery, we decide to give it a try on our little leak. Worked perfectly!

Trypsin is most active at body temperature, so warm the solution to 37C in advance. EDTA acts synergistically with trypsin: it is a calcium chelator, which integrins needs to interact with other proteins for cell adhesion, so EDTA by itself will loosen the bonds between cells. But it also acts to mop up divalent cations that would otherwise inhibit trypsin activity. This step is one of the workhorses in terms of breaking open cells, and degrading and flushing out their content. You'll still see a lot of blood coming out, but it's definitely not just blood alone, and by the end of this step you'll notice the heart getting significantly paler. Trypsin can be purchased online but If you can\u2019t get your hands on trypsin or want to do a DIY version, you could use other proteases that are much easier to find.

Contamination from chemicals or bacteria can destroy weeks of work and waste all the money put into the project. Ethanol is your new best friend; people might think you've become an alcoholic when they smell your new friend on you all the time, but it's the best thing ever. Also don't be overly concerned when you spill it pretty much all of the lab; it evaporates super quickly.- Once sterile open the incubator you've been storing your osteoblasts in.- We want to now check for confluence. Confluence is tissue talk for cell population density.- You want to have >85% (approximately) confluence before passaging cells. Which means that 85% of the viewing field you see through your microscope has cells. This is important to stay on top of because confluent cells will not continue reproducing. It also good to grow as many cells as possible because they're a valuable resource which you might need.- If NOT confluent, you need to give your cells more time to grow. So sterilize the flask, bring it to the biohood/clean bench, and aspirate the media out of it while being mindful of not scrape the bottom of the flask where the cells live. Discard your pipette.

Our project's goal was to connect art from the ancient world to modern technology and fabrication. So we 3D printed a celtic knot ouroboros design that we made. We've attached an STL of that file which you can use to 3D print or if you're in the know then you can also laser cut a similar scaffold using the top view.- You can make your scaffold out of many things as long as it is not toxic. We recommend clear PLA or acrylic. Clear is best because it is easiest to see cells on with a light microscope. Our scaffolds were made of VeroWhite, a type of acrylic. However, it is NOT clear which caused us some issues later on with imaging.- Our scaffold has pores to create more surface area for the cells to adhere to, and encourage the ingrowth of cells. To do this I made a linear array of pores in solidworks and performed an extrude cut. We found that 1200 and 1300 micron diameter pores worked best (probably because it allowed the protein coating to attach better, but that's ahead.) We realize most 3D printers will struggle with something like this. My advice to you is to use a tiny drill bit, or a laser cutter. Or don't do pores at all.*- Keep it small and thin. Petri dishes are small and shallow. If your scaffold is too big it will either not fit, or take up enough space such that you can't fill the dish with a sufficient amount of media. Additionally, petri dishes spill easily, so don't overfill them.- Make it fairly flat, or cells will wash off. This build doesn't utilize a bioreactor which can hold media or cells in place.*These results are supported by two experiments we did with arrays of cells and cell adhesion.

The amount of media is a little iffy because you want to cover your scaffold completely, but not put so much in that you will deprive your cells of media. This problem is part scaffold design, and experience.ProTip: After passaging cells are very easily moved around by fluid shear forces.

I hope it inspirers both beginning and experienced makers to keep on building.According to Wikipedia the definition of  EKG is:\"Electrocardiography (ECG or EKG *) is the process of recording the electrical activity of the heart over a period of time using electrodes placed on a patient's body. These electrodes detect the tiny electrical changes on the skin that arise from the heart muscle depolarizing during each heartbeat.\"In this instructable, I will show you how to build a portable EKG, that fits the above description, using COTS (Common  Of The Shelf) parts.But before we start the build, and because this is a device that you attach to your body:DISCLAMER: This project is not intended to be used as a medical device, it was conceived for educational purposes, use of this device for  purposes other than those intended,  is at your own risk.That said, practical uses of this monitor are biofeedback - meditation aid,  lie detector   heart rate monitor , etc...The main purpose of this instructable is to show you how you can use the Arduino to monitor your heart rate, and learn  a little about  how  modern medicine can diagnose heart related health issues.Most of the projects I make are for my own edification, but I also love to share my findings with others and hope that some of you enjoy learning by making as much as I do.

This shield is the most expensive part of the project, but in my opinion, totally worth it's cost.Once you have your parts in hand, just align the male pins on the OLIMEX shield with the female sockets on the Arduino and push with enough pressure to allow the pins to slide into the Arduino sockets. Do the same with the TFT LCD Shield and stack it on top of the OLIMEX Shield.  You Are done with the Build..!! HARDWARE DESCRIPTIONSBefore we go to the Software configuration, I want to briefly describe the hardware components, how they interact and what resources they use to perform the functions we desire.- for those who are interested. If not, feel free to go and configure the software in the next step. Below are summary descriptions  of the three boards used, summarized from information found in the internet.THE ARDUINO UNOThe first component is the Arduino Micro controller. I like to think of the Arduino as a set of pins that I can control and configure (through software instructions) to do my bidding. The pins are divided into three categories: Digital pins, Analog pins, and Support pins.The Digital pins:Each of the 14 digital pins on the Arduino Uno can be used as an input or output, using pinMode(),digitalWrite(), and digitalRead() functions. They operate at 5 volts. Each pin can provide or receive a maximum of 40 mA and have an internal pull-up resistor (disconnected by default) of 20-50 KOhms.  In addition, some pins have specialized functions:Serial: pins 0 (RX) and 1 (TX) are used to receive (RX) and transmit (TX) TTL serial data. These pins are also connected to the corresponding pins of the ATmega8U2 USB-to-TTL Serial chip( if you use these pins to interface with a sensor or output device, you will need to disconnect the device before downloading a program or it will probably interfere with the download). External Interrupts: pins 2 and 3. These pins can also be configured to trigger an interrupt on a low value, a leading or falling edge, or a change in value. See the attachInterrupt() function for details. PWM pins: 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11. can also Provide 8-bit PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) output with the analogWrite() function (usually used to control motor speed). SPI: 10 (SS), 11 (MOSI), 12 (MISO), 13 (SCK). These pins support SPI communication using the SPI library. LED: 13. There is a built-in LED connected to digital pin 13. When the pin is HIGH value, the LED is on, when the pin is LOW, it\u2019s off.The analog pins The Uno has 6 analog inputs, labeled A0 through A5, each of which can provide 10 bits of  analog to digital conversion resolution (i.e. 1024 different values). By default they measure from ground to 5 volts, though it is possible to change the upper end of the range using the AREF pin and the analogReference() function.in addition, some of the Analog pins also have specialized functionality: TWI(Two Wire Interface): A4 or SDA pin and A5 or SCL pin. Support TWI communication using the Wire library. (Note: you can also use the analog pins as digital pins)There are a couple of other Support pins on the board: Reset; Bring this line LOW to reset the microcontroller. Typically used to add a reset button to shields which block the one on the board.. Last but not least are the Power pins that can provide Ground and 5 volt as well as 3.3 volt power to your project.OLIMEX SHIELD-EKG-EMGThe Olimex EKG Shield is basically an instrumentation amplifier followed by an operational amplifier and a low pass filter. The shield has pass through pin sockets so you can piggy back another shield on top of it. the output is  jumper configurable to any of the Arduino analog pins (A0 to A5). Below is a summarized but  more detailed explanation from the Olimex web site:The EKG/EMG shield allows the  Arduino to  capture Electrocardiography and /or Electromyography signals. The shield opens new possibilities to experiment with biofeedback. With this shield, you can monitor your heartbeat,  log your pulse, and /or recognize gestures by monitoring and analyzing muscle activity. The EKG-EMG SHIELD converts an analog differential signal (the ECG/EMG bio potentials generated by muscles), attached to its CH1_IN+/CH1_IN- inputs, into a single stream of amplified and filtered analog signal at the output. Since the output signal is analog, it has to be fed to one of the five Arduino analog inputs to be discretized (analog to digital conversion) further with aim to give the option of digital processing. Typically, this is done via dedicated ADC embedded in the MCU of the base board (like: OLIMEXINO-328, OLIMEXINO-32U4, OLIMEXINO-STM32, etc). In the demo example we have provided, \"ShieldEkgEmgDemo.ino\", we have used 10-bit ADC with 256Hz sampling rate. SHIELD-EKG-EMG\u2019s total gain is the product of the gains of each  stage: Instrumental Amplifier(G1=10), OPamp with adjustable gain (G2=6..101) and 3rd order \"Butterworth\" filter (G3=3.56). Then, the Gtotal = G1*G2*G3 = 10*(6..101)*3.56. By default,  the G2 gain is set to approximately 80. So, Gtotal = 10*(~80)*3.56 ~ 2848. Vmaxanalog = 3.0V/2848 ~ 1mV Note that the 3rd order \"Butterworth\" filter's cutoff frequency is set to fc = 40Hz.UNO R3 2.8 TFT Touch ScreenDescription:   2.8\" TFT LCD Display is an LCD touch screen module. It has a  40 pin interface and SD card / Flash reader built in.  It is a powerful, multifunctional module .The Screen includes a  ILI9325 controller, that supports 8/16bit data interfacing ,it is  easy to drive by micro controllers like Arduino, STM32 ,AVR and 8051. It contains an integrated  touch controller. The touch IC is XPT2046 , and touch interface pins are included in the 40 pin breakout. Features:       \u2022240374PQ      \u2022262K color     \u2022240*320     \u20222.8 inch     \u2022Wide viewing angle     \u2022ILI9325:240 RGB x 320 TFT Driver     \u2022Integrated Power, Gate and Source Driver With RAM     \u2022XPT2046-WIRE TOUCH,WIRE TOUCH, UP TO 125kHz CONVERSION RATE, SERIAL INTERFACE     \u2022Voltage type: 5v or 3v voltage input voltage, input is selectable. but Because TFT can only work under 3.3 Volts  when the input voltage VIN is 5 Volts, it  needs to be converted to  3.3 Volts  by the onboard voltage regulator IC that  steps down the 5V to 3.3V. When the input voltage is  3.3 Volts, you need to use a jumper to short J2 , to bypass the voltage regulator IC and power the screen directly     Note: the factory default for the TFT module is 5 Volts power supply.  The on board SD holder is set to work on SPI mode.Component interaction and resources.Now that we are familiar with the  basic parts, lets describe how they interact with each other :The OLIMEX shield uses only one  Arduino resource, the Analog 5 input (A5).The amplified and filtered  signal from your heart is fed to this input to be digitized by the Arduino Analog to digital converter. You can select what  Arduino analog input you want to feed the signal to with a jumper, but the analog 5  (A5) is the only input not used by the TFT LCD display.The TFT Touch screen display uses  digital pins (D2 to D13) plus the analog pins (A0 to A4) to manage  the display output, the touch screen functions, and the SD card. this leaves only 3  free I/O pins on the Arduino; the  A5  analog input (which we will use to feed the signal that comes from the OLIMEX shield) and the TX (D1) and RX(D0) digital I/O pins that are used for communication.As you can see, all the pins in our Arduino are used up!!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F0J/7OT7/J3OPR4B5/F0J7OT7J3OPR4B5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBA/FAD6/J3OPR4CX/FBAFAD6J3OPR4CX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3M/RHZ9/J3OPR4II/F3MRHZ9J3OPR4II.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2N/HNTS/J3OPR4OR/F2NHNTSJ3OPR4OR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKH/PP46/J3OPR3Z0/FKHPP46J3OPR3Z0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPY/4TW1/J3OPR44U/FPY4TW1J3OPR44U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDX/2L45/J5CQ87Q4/FDX2L45J5CQ87Q4.LARGE.jpg", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png"], "step_title": "Step 1: Parts Needed /Construction"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Before you can run the sketch, you need to make sure you have the required libraries installed.

However, unlike the \"Stock\" PiCamera, a different focal length lens must be used to create the kinds of vision that we humans have.The human eye is about an inch long.  Most of the focusing power occurs at the cornea (the clear tissue that covers the front of the eye, through which you see the colored iris).  There is also a lens inside the eye that can become cloudy.  A cloudy lens is called a cataract, and cataract surgery replaces the cloudy natural lens with a clear man-made lens.The total optical power of the eye is about 60 diopters, or a lens of 16.6 mm focal length.In addition to the usual bits needed for a Pi, you will need a modified camera board that supports interchangeable lenses. I used the Arducam as it comes with a CS mount. The Arducam (www.arducam.com) has the same sensor as the stock PiCam 3, but allows the use of \"CS\" mount lenses, a common format used in security cameras.  I purcased a generic CS mount 16.7 mm focal length f 1.2 lens for this purpose.When you first turn on your Raspberry Pi and boot into \"Pixel\", the desktop environment configured for the Rasberry, be sure to enable the Pi Camera module in the configuration setup.As soon as you have your camera hooked up, I know you want to see if it works:  Type these three lines of python into an IDLE Python3 terminal window, and you will get a live display of what the camera is seeing.

I took the easy route and used a Lego Pi Case, and then used Lego blocks to create a right angle surface that the PiCamera could be mated to.One tip:  Once I had things the way I wanted them, I used a plastic adhesive to hold the blocks together.  I wouldn't do it that way again - there is a tendancy to melt the plastic and dimensions can shift.  I would use a piece of clear packing tape on one side of the blocks to hold groups of blocks together.  It is removable and the melting doesn't occur.Power tools were not required - a drill bit in a tap mount was just fine for slowly drilling through the Legos.I also made a simple levelling plate and spacer block so that the camera was at the same height of our optical demonstration lab screens and lens holders, so the camera could be used for further teaching purposes.One small problem was the weight of the HDMI cable - a water bottle was cut down to support the weight of the cable and to keep the lens from tipping over unexpectedly.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FLD/T2UB/J3UFOWWR/FLDT2UBJ3UFOWWR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOR/HU38/J3UFOWYY/FORHU38J3UFOWYY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F99/KJJH/J3OPP1PE/F99KJJHJ3OPP1PE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3K/GRAH/J3UFOWUC/F3KGRAHJ3UFOWUC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXK/PD3Z/J3OPP1N8/FXKPD3ZJ3OPP1N8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPW/750M/J3UFOWQ7/FPW750MJ3UFOWQ7.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Mate the Camera Module to the Pi"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "A simple demonstration of blur is possible at this point, but the problem is that the extremely \"fast\" f 1.2 security camera lens has a very shallow depth of field - things are either in focus, or completely out of focus, in an unrealistic way.This project was undertaken while visiting the Aravind Eye Hospitals in Madurai and Pondicherry, Tamil Nadu India in June of 2017.

I used PVC pipe and a PVC Coupler. A standard size of PVC plumbing pipe is the same diameter as the trial lens (1.5\"); small segments were cut to hold lenses in position either adjacent to the artificial pupil to \"create\" refractive error, or trial lenses a typical spectacle distance away from the artifiical pupil to simulate the correction of refractive error.

Thiselectrical impulse causes the chambers to \u201cdepolarize\u201d. Thisforces it to contract and drain deoxygenated blood from boththe Superior and Inferior vena cava into the right ventricle. Asthe electrical impulse travels across the top of the heart it thentriggers the left atrium to contract. The left atrium isresponsible for receiving newly oxygenated blood from thelungs into the left ventricle via the left and right pulmonaryveins. The pulmonary veins are red in the diagram becausethey are carrying oxygenated blood. They are still called veinsbecause veins carry blood towards the heart. Science!iii. QT IntervalThe QT Interval is where things get really interesting. The QRSis a complex process that generates the signature \u201cbeep\u201d incardiac monitors. During QRS both ventricles begin to pump.The right ventricle begins to pump deoxygenated blood intothe lungs through the left and right pulmonary arteries. Thepulmonary arteries are blue in the diagram because they arecarrying deoxygenated blood. They are still called arteriesbecause arteries carry blood away the heart. Science, Again!The left ventricle is also beginning to pump freshly oxygenatedblood through the aorta and into the rest of the body. Afterthe initial contraction comes the ST segment. The ST segmentis fairly quiet electrically as it is the time where the ventricleswaiting to be \u201cre-polarized\u201d. Finally the T wave becomespresent to actively \u201cre-polarize\u201d, or relax the ventricles. Thisrelaxation phase resets the ventricles to be filled again by theatriums.5- Temperature sensorAstronauts are exposed to a wide variety of temperature during theirmissions which can range from -250F to 250F so a temperature sensor isused to monitor the temperature and gives a warning message whennecessary.6- Pressure sensor , one of important concerns of the factors which impactsthe health of the astronaut is that the increased pressure in the eye maycause what is called \u201cOcular hypertension\u201d which causes problems in thevision and may lead to blindness so a pressure sensor is used to keep trackof the pressure and gives a warning message if the pressure exceeds acertain limit.7- IMU (Inertial measurement unit) \u2013 9DOF \u2013 Accelerometer,gyroscope, Magnetometer.in our plan of future work we added IMU in order to develop a gameslike Smart phones apps which depends on gyroscope , Accelerometersensors .8- HD-Web-Camera 720p (Microsoft 3000 HD)Which has the ability to stream a real-time video with delay 40 ms with 30frame per second through Wi-Fi dongle that connected to raspberry pimicro-computer and works as a webcam server over localhost (raspberry piip port 8080 ) .", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FIW/2V51/IQRJ9ZG3/FIW2V51IQRJ9ZG3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNM/RHA5/IQRJ9ZGS/FNMRHA5IQRJ9ZGS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY9/JKO5/IQRJ9ZGR/FY9JKO5IQRJ9ZGR.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Our System"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "1- Space Station Software.The main aim of our GUI is to provide the space station with a live feedof the current astronaut status in order to ensure a total supervisionover the astronaut and monitor his currentHealth condition in addition to providing an easy and simple means ofcommunication with the astronaut.GUI Features:o Health monitoring:\uf0a7 Monitoring the heart statues via a live cardiogram.\uf0a7 Live feed for the current temperature.\uf0a7 Live feed for the current pressure.o GUI provides warning messages if the temperature or the pressureexceeds certain limits.o Ease of communication support:o Providing a high quality live streaming for the camera fixed on theastronaut suit.o Chat facility between the space station and the astronaut via the GUIon the astronaut wearable.o All the received data, received and sent chat messages are loggedand displayed in a user friendly way accompanied by thecorresponding date and time.o Saving all data as txt log files.2- Wearable Device SoftwareA GUI programmed by Python that allow Astronauts to show theirhealth status, sensors reads with options of Chat, on-screen keyboard,keystroke software that save all astronauts keyboard inputs on thescreen, option to start live streaming.- Saving all data as excel log files .- This application also contains bash script to run the required packagesin boot.3- Arduino CodeInterfacing code with the sensors and ZigBee module to send a the datain a way of serial communication with Raspberry pi \u201cwearable softwarethrough usb cable \u201c and Space station software by ZigBee Ad-hocknetwork .c.

In both countries, the children draw their dream machine and after that we translated the winning drawing into a full working and realistich concept, together with the Slovenian students in Nova Gorica en Ljubljana. If you are interested in the fantastich My Machine project or want to know something more about our zombiemachine, you can go to following links:My Machine GlobalWordpress blog the zombiemachineBut what does the zombiemachine actually?When the kids go to bed, they can't fall asleep because they're afraid of the burglars, scarys noises and monsters under their bed.This zombie is the solution for their problem. The machine catches all monsters and burglars in a few steps to calm you down and go to sleep. It works like a pull-string-toy, attached to the ceiling. The zombie goes from the ground to the ceiling in a few steps. When the zombie hangs on the ground, it scans under the bed for zombies and burglars. Then it goes up to eyeheight, so the child can look into the zombie's mouth to see all the catched monsters. After that  it rises a little bit again and the child can choose a music of a bedtime story to calm down. In the last step the zombie rises again and becomes a nightlight. Next to this individual protecting part, the zombie also is an interactive groupgame. The zombie can be disconnected from the ceiling-system and transforms into the circle game. <The music starts and the children pass the zombie, when the music stops the child looks into the zombie and sees an image he/she needs to personate for the group.

It work on the principal of Electrodermal activity (EDA), sounds bizarre. Electrodermal activity refers to the variation of the electrical properties of the skin in response to sweat secretion. Our exposed skin always contain small amount of sweat, no matter what is the temperature outside. (see above pics)Human body contain lots of nerves, which conduct signal from our brain to periphery and vice versa. These are divided into sympathetic nerves and parasympathetic nerves. These nerves are involuntary i.e. we can\u2019t consciously control them. Our main focus area is on sympathetic nerves, because these are the nerves which control our sweat glands.So, if you are alive (you must be, otherwise there is no way you can, read this), then your brain is continuously commanding your sweat glands via sympathetic nerves to produce sweat. Sweat (good electrolyte) this means we can use our body to conduct electricity.What happens if a person is dead ?If a person is dead, that means his/her brain is not working, the signal to turn ON the sweat glands will be off. If we attach our little device on this person, our device will not register any current (as there is no sweat for the flow of current) , and there would be not output.

Right most leg of the transistor is collector, middle one is base, left most is emitter. Battery output is connected to the skin via input probe, this initiates flow of current throughout the body. The base of the transistor is one which measures the feeble current which is flowing throughout the body. If base of the transistor detects a current, it then allow a larger current to flow from collector to emitter. The LED and buzzer are connected in the path of current which flow between collector and emitter. If base detects any current it will turn ON the LED and buzzer.c) Probes (Input & Output):In the device, both input and output probes are the extension of wires, which are electrically conductive. Input probe allow current to flow from 9V battery to human skin via sweat. Output probe detects the feeble current which is flowing in the human body and then directs the current to the base of the transistor.d) Output (LED & Buzzer):LED and buzzer are the output component of the device. As already described,  LED and buzzer are connected in between 9V battery and the emitter of the transistor.

First current flows from battery to the red probe  and in the skin. Then current starts flowing from one end of the skin to the other end. When the current reached the other side of the skin, it is picked up by the black probe  The black probe samples the current from the skin and into the base of the transistor. Here in this configuration, transistor is used as a switch. As soon as current starts flowing in the base of the transistor, it allows a larger amount of current  to flow from battery to the ground  , thus turning both LED and buzzer ON.

The tick will crawl out on it's own and you won't have to deal with 'did I get it all out?'. This sounds like a magic trick and you might even think it is, I did. My sister inlaw had been telling me how to do it for quite a while and I just never tried it, because I didn't think it would work. One day when I was at the vet getting my dogs their yearly shots, my vet found a tick and removed it using this method and I was sold.\nI easily remove about 20 ticks a year from my two dogs. When I used the old way, which was get your tweezers as close to the head of the tick and pull straight out, it would often leave parts of the tick behind. Ticks seem to like areas near the eyes and ears, which would leave marks and scars that wouldn't ever go away.So how do you do it?\nRub the tick in a circular motion and pretend you're trying to make the tick dizzy. I generally stick with one direction, clockwise. It usually takes less than a minute, so if it's not working, make sure the body of the tick is moving around. Remember you can't get dizzy unless you're actually moving in a circle, quickly. I doubt the tick actually gets dizzy, but they sure don't like something about the movement and they crawl out on their own.This was too difficult to document with photos, so here's the video.", "title": "How to Remove a Tick From a Dog", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-remove-a-tick/", "section": "home", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The only troubles I have had with this technique, is when you catch the tick early in it's attaching process.

If it won't come off, I will usually wait another day instead of risking leaving part of the tick behind in my dog.This method should work on people as well, but I haven't had the chance to try it out. I don't think it will work as well, because you generally catch the tick early on and there's no body to move around. It's also easier to get parts of the tick out as you can use tweezers and then just like removing a splinter, get the rest out. Once you have the tick out, wrap the tick in a piece of tape to kill it.

It has SO MANY uses (both topically and internally) that it's a wonder more people don't use this little gem! So I want to share our experiences with coconut oil in hopes to shed a little more light on it. Note: I am NOT debating about the ingestion of coconut oil. There's a constant debate about the fat content of coconut oil versus it's healing properties when ingested, and of course I have my views based off my research and own personal testimony, but we are NOT going there. :) Let's just stick to the reality that we can attest to...TOPICAL SKIN CAREFOR ECZEMA (and other skin conditions like psoriasis): At a very tender age, my son was diagnosed with eczema. Immediately the doctor, naturally, prescribed him some steroid cream to use for his rash/dry skin. After only a few applications, I noticed the skin was getting worse, not better. When I took him back to the doctor, the doctor (as any doctor would) advised to continue using the cream a little while longer as the skin must be reacting due to a new thing being used on it. Of course, since he's a DOCTOR, I believed him. Thankfully, before using the cream on my son again, I discovered the many benefits of coconut oil (through some friends). Hallelujah! After only applying this on his skin (I did it over his ENTIRE body just to be sure!) for a matter of a week or less, his skin started clearing up and the rash discontinued. Within a couple weeks, it was gone completely! I continued to rub coconut oil on the areas of his body that would be most sustainable to eczema breakouts (ie: his knees and behind his knees, his elbows and behind them, the base of his hairline, and on his bum)...and after doing this for only about a month straight, he has not had any more issues in the past EIGHT YEARS with eczema! Here is one mom's horror-story with the use of steroid creams and how she cured it with natural remedies (for your consideration): http://dailyhealthpost.com/mom-solves-the-mystery-...FOR A STY & PINK EYE:Have you ever had a sty in your eye? Or pink eye/conjunctivitis? Whip out the coconut oil! We've experienced both. At the first signs put coconut oil on the eyelid, water line, and inner eyes (or even in the eye as a salve) and it will prevent or kill that sty/bacteria within a day or two. Awesome stuff! Safe for toddlers and babies, too. (Note: if you apply it inside the actual eye, not just on the lid, it will make a little blur over your eyesight--hello, you just put oil in your eyeball! lol--but it does NOT make it so you cannot see or do anything bad to you or your eyes. We did this once for my husband when he had a huge sty swelling up his eye from underneath his eyelid. We put it up under his lid directly onto the sty middle with a Q-tip before he went to bed so when he woke up in the morning everything was perfect and the sty nearly gone! It completely left his eye within another day.)FOR SWELLING, PUNCTURE WOUNDS, & POSSIBLE STAPH:My youngest daughter has always seemed to have some sort of crazy skin condition. In the beginning of the madness, she was getting these little wounds on her skin that would ooze and spread. Our doctor friend thought this may just be poison ivy and she was treated as such. But over time, the skin issues would start to develop a red circle around them (that was hot to the touch), and then they would begin to rapidly swell to well over twice her normal size arm, leg, etc. It got so bad, and so frequent, that with even the slightest puncture to her skin (where some small point went under her top skin layer), she would develop the red, hot circle and then swell. Once the circle came, we knew there was nothing we could do but watch her swell and race her to the emergency room to intervene. A doctor friend of ours told us that was indicating it had already gone into the bloodstream, as it would usually show up a day or so after the initial puncture. The first occasion this happened, my husband thought she got stung by a bee on her hand. So we did what you normally do (since she had been stung before and never had a reaction), scrape it with a credit card to make sure there's no stinger and clean it out to disinfect it. But within a day, the red circle came, and her hand swelled so rapidly  that by the following day it was black and the skin was pulled extremely tight, being over double to triple her normal hand size. We rushed her to the Emergency Room and watched as they seemed helpless to stop it! They first gave her the usual...an IV drip with an anti-inflammatory and an antihistamine (because they thought it was an allergic reaction to a bee sting). The kicker was, to insert the IV, they needed to find a vein. They pricked her SEVEN TIMES in the non-swollen arm trying to find a vein, but couldn't. Then they decided, as a last resort, to try pricking the swollen side. So they put a tourniquet on both the top and bottom of her arm, and just before they went to prick her, the part of the arm they draw blood from started oozing blood out of the pores! Man, I made them get those tourniquets off so fast!!! Long story short, they finally got an IV in using her original pin-cushioned arm and gave her the meds, none of which helped reduce the swelling in any sooner-then-later amount of time (it took over a week to reduce to any normalcy of size!), and she just was a trooper through it all! They sent her home with antibiotics (\"just in case\"), only after we sat there another 8 hours because the doctor thought she might be dying from the \"bleed out\" that happened when they tried to insert her IV in her swollen arm.  My what a frightening day! (We even thought after awhile that it must be a type of staph infection that keeps reoccurring as the top of the skin staph is forced into the under layers by the means of a puncture wound. But that was never confirmed, so the mystery remains.)When this swelling after any kind of puncture wound happened repeatedly and more frequently, we decided enough was enough! There had to be something out there that could naturally cure this! Especially because a person isn't allowed to have (and shouldn't take) the same antibiotics over and over and over again as this causes one's body to have immunity against the antibiotic's help in the future (or other, worse things like the body's complete rejection of these after awhile). And if the medicine was not an option because of the frequency, then we would be have no other options! So off to find that natural remedy I did! And I re-encountered coconut oil. Duh...the light went on again...how quick to forget. At the first sign of a puncture wound (or if it was too late to find one, but there was a red circle already beginning) we would put coconut oil directly on the wound, and it never manifested past the red circle stage! In fact, it's been 2-3 years that she's had any swelling caused from puncture wounds (except ONE time, that we will get to, that was a whole other type of wound and home remedy to fix it). NOTES: I've also used coconut oil on my hands when they are super raw from lots of washing or the winter. I've used it on myself and my kids when we get any kind of rash or skin irritation. In fact, there's over 1,001 different uses for coconut oil. Check out this site for more info: http://coconutresearchcenter.org/hwnl_9-4.htmINTERNAL USEFOR BOWEL & INTESTINAL BLOCKAGE: My husband has had a lot of fun (well, \"fun\") health things happen to him. From his gall bladder failing, to his appendix being removed, to a weird benign growth developing on his back, to his right eye suddenly losing (and then regaining over a week later) his vision completely...he's had his fair share of crazies. So when his stomach started hurting a lot and it was accompanied for over a week or two with vomiting, diarrhea, and even blood in the vomit and diarrhea...he knew he had to get it checked out. (Normal people go quite a bit earlier then a week or two, but my hubby is a stubborn man, lol). At the hospital, the doctors discovered there was a blockage of some sort in his intestines/bowel area and it would probably have to be surgically removed. He had an appointment scheduled the following week to find out a little more and plan the next best option. In this time, I suggested he ingest coconut oil (as it has healing properties for IBS, etc). Over the week, his vomiting and diarrhea ceased, and at his doctor appointment, the blockage was now completely gone! What a miracle!! So do some research on this amazing natural remedy, and keep a jar on hand at all times :)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FC4/NHUP/ILWLAFGW/FC4NHUPILWLAFGW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Coconut Oil"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "No, we aren't making a St. Patty's Day stew (lol)...we're sharing our testimonies regarding these (somewhat well-known) natural remedies.TOPICAL GARLIC & CABBAGEFOR MYSTERIOUS PUNCTURE WOUND INFECTIONS: Remember my daughter's crazy swelling and that one time in 2-3 years she's had another episode of it? Well here's what went down with that. So, we have recently come to Canada from the States (our native country). No, everyone doesn't live in igloos. And no, it's not freezing cold everywhere, all the time (our winter here was quite mild actually). But they do have some \"weird\" things (maybe that's just because I wasn't raised with them)...like: eating pickles at every meal and/or perogies, poutine (it was so weird hearing the waitress at our first meal in Canada ask us if we wanted gravy with our fries, lol), and calling brussel sprouts the side of choice at all major holidays (like Christmas and Thanksgiving). Welp, add psychotic mosquitoes to your list, Canada ;) Our first apartment in Canada was by a little lake. In the summer, the mosquitoes weren't just bad...they were so thick you couldn't breathe in without sucking one up your nose or mouth! Even more so down by this--gorgeous!--lake. Well, our little girl got bit by them (I swear they could bite you through a layer of steel on!) and for the first time in years she swelled. Looking pretty typical to what we had seen before, we did our usual coconut oil. When this didn't work, we tried activated charcoal (more on that in the next step), to try and draw out the toxins from the bite. This still wouldn't work! So we asked around, and finally one of our friends said to use one or more of these ingredients: garlic, onion, potato, and/or cabbage (see * below for more info on each of these). So we decided to go with the cabbage and garlic approach. First, we needed to reduce her swelling. BOTH of her legs were swollen, making it not only painful, but also entirely difficult to walk or play. We took some raw cabbage leaves, beat them up with a rolling pin or meat pounder, and then applied the oozing, juicy cabbage leaves to the bites on her legs (in a staggering fashion to allow all the juices from each leaf to reach her skin), securing them with plastic wrap. When we were done she looked like a salad bar! With a few days, the swelling was totally gone! Now our problem became getting the swelling to STAY down. Every time we took off the cabbage, within a day the swelling would come back, but then stop again with the cabbage on. Therefore, I figured it must be the infection inside still that is re-causing it to swell again.  I took some minced garlic directly out of the jar on a little plastic knife, and applied the garlic directly to each wound. Then I covered it in cabbage and plastic wrap again and let it sit for a couple days. Eureka! That's all it took! We finally solved the \"Case of the Psycho Mosquito Bites\" mystery! MEDICINAL ONION WATER AND TOPICAL GARLIC PASTEFOR INTESTINAL PARASITE REMOVAL: Yes, this one is a yucky topic. But, it's needed to be discussed...Intestinal parasites (aka pinworms). Pinworms are the most common type of intestinal parasite and are easily contracted from eating contaminated food (ie: at a restaurant or from the deli) or from not washing your hands after (probably unknowingly) touching a contaminated surface (of someone with pinworms) and putting your hands then in your mouth. Either way, as disgusting as they are, they aren't unheard of or only found in vacationing to other countries. And quite frankly, as a vegetarian who eats mostly at home, I never thought that 1 in a million chance would hit me. Either way, it did and this is how I cured it. Most doctors will instantly, after verifying you have pinworms (you can Google symptoms to check if you think you have them), give you a very toxic medicine that you have to get your liver checked first to make sure it can handle it. This toxic medicine (though damaging to the rest of your body) only kills the actual pinworms, and isn't guaranteed to kill their eggs (which can stay alive for about 20 days after being \"laid\" meaning you could get a recurring infestation after the initial pinworms are dead..then you have to start all over). Natural remedies to the rescue once again! I used two things to rid myself of pinworms AND their eggs...and I did it quicker then the 2-4 weeks the doctors medicines take (along with having to wash EVERYTHING down to an extreme amount EVERYDAY for those 2-4 weeks and do laundry EVERYDAY as pinworms are easily spread around your household). The two miracle cures: Onion water and garlic paste...ONION WATER: To make onion water, chop up 2 onions and and soak them in a full pint of water overnight (or for 12 hours). Strain the onions out and take the leftover onion water and drink ONE CUP of this three times per day. All the pinworms will be gone in 2 days! GARLIC PASTE: This sounds nasty but it WORKS, and FAST! Garlic paste is applied directly to the rear-end hole where pinworms (after traveling through your intestines) like to congregate and lay their eggs. This KILLS the eggs and helps kill any pinworms there. To make it simply mix petroleum jelly (or you could use coconut oil) and jarred minced or freshly minced garlic to it. This also instantly relieves the itching caused by pinworms in this area.

After the kids started throwing up (they seem to always get sick like this suddenly in the middle of the night), we knew we were not only next, but that we would have to do something to keep this in check REAL quick. Activated charcoal comes in two forms: pill form (with a gluten capsule) or powder form. I like the pill form and here's why...it's properly measured out to the proper amounts you should be ingesting (not that too much charcoal will hurt you) and it's cleaner and easier to swallow when your throwing up (as the powder must be in liquid and when you're stomach is upset, a big glass of liquid is the LAST thing you want to take). Also, it can be opened up to use as a powder form in drinks should you need to (like what we have to do for our kids as they can't swallow the pills). So having the pills makes it a win-win for the adults AND the kids with their versatility. No, activated charcoal is not like sucking on a charcoal piece out of the bottom of a grill. Hahaha. It's actually designed for internal use (and topical!) and isn't toxic. It helps clean out your intestines and bowels and aids in stomach pains etc. It also helps to \"absorb\" all the toxic or viral/bacterial things in your body and trap them, pushing them out the other end...so it makes a perfect healer when you are throwing up!Well, we all took it and (after--forceably--keeping it down by laying flat on the bed) the stomach pain lessened to almost non-existent. The throwing up completely stopped and we now could function and get some much needed rest to finish combating this horrible stomach virus (without throwing up every two minutes)! This is truly a lifesaver! It may cause more to come out the other end, but I found that it's easier to get up and use the restroom when not throwing up all over the place. And it's easier to keep liquids down and replenish your lost electrolytes when you're throwing up has ceased. (Note: it WILL turn your diarrhea black, but that's a good indicator that it's getting all the bad stuff out!)TOPICAL ACTIVATED CHARCOALFOR WOUNDS, INJURIES, & INFECTIONS:We have used activated charcoal paste (simply powder charcoal from a pill put into a little bowl and adding water until it makes a paste) for many an injury as it draws out infectious bacteria, viruses, and fungus. It also aids in the healing process, much in the same way coconut oil does. One time we used it was for our youngest daughter's puncture injuries (applied right after they happened--before coconut oil) to ensure the toxins are removed and her swelling wouldn't occur. You can basically use it anytime you get a cut, puncture, etc that you don't want to get infected. It's been used all throughout history, and you can find out more about that below...LEARN MORE ABOUT ACTIVATED CHARCOAL HERE:http://www.natural-holistic-health.com/the-benefit...That's all y'all!

Preventative measures-When the pain is first noticed, begin taking a dosage of 6,000 to 8,000 mg of Vitamin C along with 800 to 1,000 I.U.s of Vitamin E three times a day. The pain is usually gone within 24 hours. Repeat this dosage the second day after which the hemorrhoids should start to decrease in size. Repeat the dosage the third day after which they are usually gone entirely. If not, repeat the dosage one more day. Once the hemorrhoids are gone, a maintenance dosage of 1,000 mg Vitamin C and 400 I.U.s of Vitamin E taken daily will help strengthen the blood vessels.

Humans have 12 pairs of cranial nerves:  1). olfactory nerve  2). optic nerve  3). oculomotor nerve  4). trochlear nerve  5). trigeminal nerve  6). abducens nerve  7). facial nerve  8). vestibulocochlear nerve  9). glossopharyngeal nerve  10). vagus nerve  11). spinal accessory nerve  12). hypoglossal nerve  The functions of these nerves include carrying sensory information to the brain, controlling muscles, and regulating glands and internal organs. The first picture above depicts each cranial nerve's point of departure from the brain.  This particular Instructable focuses on cranial nerve 5, the trigeminal nerve. This nerve originates in the pons, a part of the brainstem, and has both sensory and motor functions. The trigeminal nerve controls muscles of mastication (biting and chewing) and carries sensory information about touch and pain from the face. The second picture above shows the three areas of the face that the trigeminal nerve innervates. This Instructable will demonstrate 3 useful exercises for checking a patient's trigeminal nerve function. By testing the sense of touch and the muscle contractions of the face, these exercises will demonstrate the trigeminal nerve's ability to carry sensory information from the face to the brain, and its ability to control the temporalis, masseter, and pterygoid muscles that manipulate the jaw.  Requirements:  1). basic understanding of anatomy  2). patient who is comfortable with his/her face being touched  3). Q-tip  4). scissors (for cutting the Q-tip in half)  Time: 10 minutes  \u00a0Safety Concerns: The one performing the examination should be careful not to unnecessarily poke the patient with the Q-tip.

The size difference from 20-14 is fairly small. After a fresh piercing, you need to wait until it is fully healed, which takes 1-2 months. Now it's critical to consider what your stopping size might be for your ear lobes.

If the pain level is more than a slight discomfort, stop the stretch and continue at\u00a0the earliest,\u00a01 week after the previous stretch. The taper should be all the way into your lobe now. Grab a single flare tunnel of the corresponding size, line the back of the single flare tunnel to the front of the taper, and push the tunnel into the taper, replacing it with your new, larger tunnel.\u00a0 It is highly recommended that you wait at least a month for healing time in between stretches.\u00a0This method works flawlessly up to 0g.

Stretching causes minimal microscopic tears to your lobe. Stretching too fast or too hard can cause severe tears, and possibly, even the infamous blowout. A blow out is where the inside of your piercing, the fistula, is forced to the back of the piercing from inserting a larger sized object in your ear to quickly, or before your ears are fully healed and ready for the next step. A blowout can appear as a flap of skin on the backside of the plug and tends to be unsightly. If your ears ever bleed, downsize your earrings ATLEAST one size, and clean twice a day with bactine, then rub on vitamin E oil.

I was constantly missing my comfort over the counter USA medicines when I was there. You can't find Alka Seltzer or Pepto Bismo in most Asian countries, and that drove me nuts. Their equivalent did not compare, so I started to make a bag with me to bring on all my trips and on the plane.My kit like most of the ones I see on Instructables, has evolved, and gotten bigger. It's at the point now where I can still throw it in the bottom of my backpack I bring on the plane, which is fine for me. What I like most about my latest version of my Travel Med Kit is the bags I use. I found that heavy mill ziplocs on Amazon with the Eagle Creek shoe bag makes it very easy for me to get to any item in the bag. If I'm traveling and I need something from the bag, I just dump the whole thing out on the hotel bed. I can easily find what I need and throw it all back in the shoe bag, zip it up, and be done with it. I suggest the heavy mil ziplocs, the sizes are perfect and they won't degrade. All the items I have in the Travel Med Kit are TSA approved sizes, even the scissors. I have been checked a few times, and one time they opened the kit up. I told them it's 4in and approved. They agreed and let me pass. I know when they see this kit, they MUST know I'm not a terrorist lol, what terrorist is going to carry meds that could possibly save a life on a plane! About some of the drugs I carry: I have a prescription for Ambien, although I'm not a regular user of it, it does have it uses.  I also have Celebrex and a couple Z Paks just in case I feel the need to self diagnose and start the meds early. At the very least if you want to be prepared on a plane carry Sudafed and a Zyrtec Antacid.  If someone is having a anaphylactic reaction, you could offer those two pills and possibly save a life. Most of the Airlines I fly on won't even have Aspirin, and if there is an emergency they go around asking if there are doctors, and unfortunately the doctors won't have meds on them. So you could really make a difference if you have a med kit on a plane. I'll list out what the items are in each bag, some of them double up a bit.I would love to hear suggestions on what to add!", "title": "Ultimate Carry on Approved Travel Medicine Chest", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Ultimate-Carry-On-Approved-Travel-Medicine-Chest/", "section": "home", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The hardest thing about assembling these med kits are trying to find the travel sizes at a good price.

Old ideas that don't work must be abandoned and replaced with new ideas and actions that better fit reality. To do this well, requires a certain objectivity and a willingness to give up any of our cherished ideas that do not work. It is when we give up our own dogmatism and bad habits that we begin to become more creative and healthier.Let It Go, Let It Flow\nForget the deadline, forget the goal, let it flow. Begin where you can and see where it takes you. Try a few ideas and see what the results suggest. Don't just sit and endlessly chew on ideas like bubblegum, see if they can be expanded or will just pop in your face. It is in the attempt that you will discover new things. Maybe not what you expected, but something new to you. As someone has put it: \"Things are better done than said\"\nThe step 1 pic shows some of the shapes I have experimented with in order to create functional curved circuit boards.

But simpler doesn't necessarily mean easier. In most designs, It is easiest to just keep adding things until something works. Much harder is to reduce things down to their essence and eliminate everything that is unnecessary. In all my designs whether it be electronics, robots, art or lifestyle, I strive to find a beautiful simplicity. The smaller the better.Small Is Beautiful\nIf you look at a brain cell you will see the ultimate microcomputer. It not only does complex calculations on a molecular scale, it does this in concert with billions of other cells. And it is self replicating. While it has been studied for decades, no one has yet figured out the exact circuit that makes up a neuron. No one knows exactly how it does what it does. We have approximations but no certainty. Yet our microcontroller designs which are pale imitations of a neuron continue to do more with less. All of our electronics are becoming smaller and more efficient with each new generation and it is on an intersecting path with the ultimate circuit, the brain cell.\nIn electronics you can see a magnificent simplicity in the design of even mechanical components such as a touch switch. In an ipod and other devices, a touch switch has been reduced to an invisible conductive coating only a few molecules thick.Kismet\nI believe it is our fate to continually strive to make things more efficient and when possible--smaller. It is an inescapable human inclination. We have barely scratched the surface when it comes to reducing things down to the bare essentials. We still tend toward ornament and frills which are costly and often unnecessary.Reducing Excess\nLikewise, when we eliminate the excess from our actions, our lives become simpler and less stressful. When we drop the frills, we can learn portion control and moderation and that always turns out to be healthy. Even in diet, smaller can be better: How Eating Less Might Make You Live Longer\nThe step 2 pic shows some of my attempts to create ever smaller and simpler forms of robots that can pick up an object and manipulate it. I am currently trying to develop a microscopic robot with a gripper.\nFor details on the smaller robots see: https://www.instructables.com/id/Building-Small-Robots-Making-One-Cubic-Inch-Micro/\nAndhttps://www.instructables.com/id/Build-a-Very-Small-Robot-Make-The-Worlds-Smalles/", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F1D/Q9M8/GHI9CQG4/F1DQ9M8GHI9CQG4.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: KISMET-Keep It Simple, Make Everything Tinier"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Fear Not Your Friend: Failure\nFear of failure is one of the biggest obstacles that can limit creativity. It can immobilize the creative spirit. When you give up on artificial deadlines, arbitrary goals, and a foolish perfectionism, real progress becomes possible. If you are afraid of trying new things because you are afraid of looking foolish, you could end up looking foolish. As Einstein put it: \u201cif we knew what we were doing, it wouldn\u2019t be called research, would it?\u201dTry Things\nTry and make your idea a reality. Try the original idea and then try variations on the idea. Pay close attention to the results especially if they are not what you expected.Self Honesty\nBeing able to admit when you are wrong or traveling in the wrong direction is the beginning of learning and that requires honesty. Before you can admit your mistakes or failures to others you must be able to admit them to yourself. Many people have in the back of their minds the idea that if they were just smart enough they would already know how to do it. Do not assume that you should already know how to do it. Instead, assume that you do not know enough and be willing to do whatever is necessary to find out the rest.Persistence Pays\nFor every creative project that I do that is at least somewhat successful, I have one or two that are total failures. I tend to follow the Thomas Edison method of invention. To make his light bulb, he tried a couple of hundred different materials for the filament until he found one that worked. He even tried unlikely things, leaving himself open to discover beyond his best ideas or limiting preconceptions.\nLikewise, you know what your unhealthy bad habits are. No one has to tell you. Deep down, you have seen how some of your habits--no matter how fun-- are in the end, nothing but debilitating. If you are paying attention, you can see them taking their toll. They are aging you and reducing your lifespan. Perhaps you've tried to diet or give up smoking and failed. Keep at it. Never give up. Those who are honest and sincere in doing better, will eventually find a way to make it happen.\nThe step 3 pic shows some of the hundreds of mixes I tried, in an attempt to create my own flexible conductive glue. It isn't pretty, but it works. Most of them were too brittle, too high a resistance, too expensive, or they dissolved into dust. I kept at it for a couple of years and the results are here: https://www.instructables.com/id/Make-Conductive-Glue-and-Glue-a-Circuit/", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FVJ/073G/GHI9CQGH/FVJ073GGHI9CQGH.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Succeeding by Failing"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "We tend to see only what we bother to look at. To go beyond our tunnel vision requires going outside of our head. If we are lost in a mind swimming in ideas, we can often lose sight of what is happening right in front of us.Ignore Your Critics\nAs someone once said: \"Never underestimate yourself, leave that to the experts\"\nNo matter what you do, there will be people anxious to put down your best efforts. Some people are just angry and looking for someone to lash out at. Others are so arrogant they feel they are superior to everyone and will automatically reject creativity that didn't originate from them. It is much easier to criticize than to create.\nIgnore those who are simply venting their hostility and keep working. Ignore those who are trying to nitpick your projects apart and keep on course.Learn From Your Critics\nOn the other hand, do not reject good ideas just because they come from a overly critical person or someone you do not like. If you are paying attention, you can learn from anyone--even the devil himself. Sometimes even mean spirited, vindictive people who are only trying to put you down, contain in their vitriol some truth that should be heeded.\nBe ready to learn from anyone. Be willing to learn from everything. Creativity comes from taking the best you see in everything around you and improving or building on it.\nThe step 4 pic shows how the two high intensity LEDs were wired with 22 gauge wire in a spiral.

There is no time to wait until you have ideal conditions. Start the project even though you don't have the perfect tools or materials. Improvise.

Show your sincerity and determination not by talking about it but by prompt action. Anything less is insincerity of the worst kind.Fast And Dirty Wins The Day\nMake it now with what you have and then see what you are missing. Maybe you need different materials or maybe you need more research to find information you don't have. Initially, don't try to make it perfect, just try to get it so it works. You can refine the details later once you have proof of concept. It is quite rare that the first prototype is anything but ugly. Refine the form. Improve the function. Don't expect to get it right on the first try.\nThe step 5 pic is a robot walker that I have started which uses circuit boards as the structure.

It's called serendipity:http://www.impactlab.net/2010/02/21/19-accidental-discoveries-that-changed-the-world/\nIdeas are just tools to aid the creative process. They are not the ultimate goal. The real goal is something that works, something that is useful in the real world. Any design idea or notion that stands in the way must be abandoned.

You will often find web sites about it.\nMost of our ideas are not entirely original. We are building on what has gone before. It is in the refinement and new applications of old ideas that much of our creativity comes from. Many of the best ideas are from nature. Most of our so called original ideas have all been tried and refined in Nature. That is where I go first for inspiration.Learning By Subtraction\nReal creativity begins with the right attitude. Sometimes before you can add you have to subtract whatever is in the way. You cannot take hold of something new if your hands are already full. Sometimes this requires the painful parting from cherished ideas or partial projects that do not work.\nThe step 8 pic shows the circuit board pieces that were used in the glow lamp.

Because Selenium makes your body recycle its own natural really powerful anti-oxidant called glutathione... When you have enough Selenium in your blood, your body recycles glutathione, and uses it to its maximum efficiency. Which is why Selenium is such a powerful anti-cancer drug. 200mg of Selenium reduces the occurrence of breast cancer by 82 percent, colon cancer by 69 percent, prostate cancer by 64 percent, and lung cancer by 39 percent.

And when you rectify the imbalance, they fall off. I've had lots of testimonials, myself included, with people getting on board with a solid medical nutrition program and skin tags just fall off.

Scalp Flap Transfer \u2013 A elongated, slender flap of scalp is detached and positioned across a bald part to make a strip of normal hair development. Areas of the bald scalp can be eliminated. The donor spot is sealed by extending the reverse side of the scalp. 2. Scalp Reduction \u2013 This is the elimination of as much of the bald segment as likely and done in the initial operation. The nearby hair bearing areas of scalp are drawn in near to the bald segment. This method is done at a future date to ultimately recreate the bald region. 3. Tissue Expansion \u2013 A device called a tissue expander is positioned below a hair development region set next to to a bald part. Following numerous weeks, the tissue expander causes skin to produce new skin cells. A different operation is essential to position the freshly extended skin over the attached bald part. 4. To attain anticipated fullness, several surgical sessions are required. There is a healing period of numerous months advised between every meeting. The ending outcome with a complete transplant sequence can take up to 2 years. 5. A month or two following surgery, the grafted hair comes out. It takes an additional month or more before hair development begins. To produce more natural-looking outcomes, a surgical touch-up process might be essential. This might involve using a blend of diminutive grafts or slit grafts to fill and blend into the hairline. Pros: \u2022 No lined scar in donor part \u2022 No limits on arduous exercise following the process Cons: \u2022 If the donor part contracts, the scarring can become noticeable Reloxe Reloxe are natural hair regrowth supplements that were made to help counterbalance the inequity produced by poor diet selections and the ecological influence. How to Use Reloxe 1. Take two capsules each day for two months. 2. Take care of your hair by eating protein and plenty of fruits and vegetables. 3. Avoid hair extensions. 4. Avoid alcohol. 5. Use a gentle brush. 6. Use hair loss vitamins. Pros: \u2022 Makes skin and hair healthy \u2022 Hair growth is noticeable \u2022 Hair thickness in 2 or 3 months Cons: \u2022 Costly and takes a long 2 months to see results There aren\u2019t any promises that you can avoid loss of hair that is hereditarily programmed or loss of hair produced by issues that you cannot regulate.

An estimated 67% of people globally are effected by the virus.Why does the sore only appear sometimes?Though those exposed to the virus have it laying dormant in their system at all times, the cold sores only flare up occasionally.  This causes a physical blister formed by the virus when the body is under stress. You might be one of the lucky people who do not have flare ups turning into a physical blister, but msot people do.

The teenage years are always the most awkward years of one's life. You're in that in-between world where you're not exactly a child anymore but you're not an adult yet, either. More often than not, you feel that you don't fit inside your body, your body itself feels strange to you, and you feel this pressure to fit in and have the respect of your friends and peers. Add to that the fact that the teenage years come with teenage acne.Teenage acne is one of the most common types of acne. It's among the many consequences of having the hormone surges that come with going through puberty and entering the teenage years. The rising hormone levels in the body lead to the secretion of excess sebum or skin oil, which can trap dirt and dead skin cells in the skin's pores. These dead skin cells and dirt serve as food for bacteria. The growing bacteria colony can irritate the skin and cause the bumps we call pimples.Thankfully, there is a way to keep your skin acne-free, even if your body is surging with hormones. Here are five steps you should consider if you want your teenage skin to be relatively free of teenage acne.Image source: Flickr", "title": "Teenage Acne \u2013 Five Steps to Acne-Free Skin", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Teenage-Acne-Five-Steps-to-Acne-Free-Skin/", "section": "home", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Do you know what your skin type is? Knowing your skin type is very important. That's because you have to consider your skin type when you're purchasing skin care products, as well as when you're building a personal beauty and skin care routine.Basically, there are five skin types. Normal skin is clear, does not show any sensitivity to most skin care products, and doesn't have blemishes. Dry skin is skin that is flaky and rough. Oily skin is skin that tends to be greasy and have big pores. Combination skin is skin that is oily on the forehead and nose areas but dry on the cheeks, chin and other areas of the face. Sensitive skin is skin that gets red, swollen and irritated if exposed to chemical products like soaps and perfumes.You've got to know your skin type first before you buy a skin care product or makeup or formulate a beauty and skin care routine.Image source: Flickr", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FRG/0G0H/IATHLUMW/FRG0G0HIATHLUMW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Step 1: Know Your Skin Type"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Teenage acne is caused by dirt and dead skin cells trapped by excess skin oil in the pores. It goes without saying that to keep your skin pimple-free, you have to keep your skin clean.You only need to wash your face twice daily to make your skin dirt-free. Excessive washing is also bad for the skin; doing so strips away the skin's natural oils and makes your skin dry. So, just wash your face once in the morning and once at night before going to bed. Use a mild soap or a gentle cleanser to get the dirt off your skin. Moisturize your skin after washing it. Never sleep with makeup on. Your makeup can clog your pores and contribute to your skin irritation.Wash your face too after engaging in a strenuous activity that got you sweating or exposed to dirt, such as working out, doing chores or playing sports. Your sweat can trap dirt inside your pores and clog them, leading to infection and the formation of pimples.Image source: Flickr", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSX/BA3B/IATHLUMV/FSXBA3BIATHLUMV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Step 2: Keep Your Face Clean"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Water is not just good for relieving thirst.

We will use mortar instead of concrete, because it is easier to obtain a smooth surface using mortar (concrete contains gravels). You will need a big bowl of about 24 cm side length (or diameter) as a mold (its size and shape may vary depending your taste and supplies). As you are going to pierce a hole in it (for the threaded rod), the best choice is a cheap plastic basin. I found a square one with rounded edges, which gave a nice shape to my scratching post foot.The foot must contain a captive nut on which the threaded rod will be screwed on. This threaded rod is the backbone of the post, and gives its sturdiness to the cardboard tower. So once you have found the proper basin, you will have to drill a 8mm hole in its center. Pouring the mortar in the basin with the whole rod inserted is not going to be convenient, so you will have to cut a small part of the rod (about 4cm long) as temporary guide. It is better to lube this rod to help extracting it once the mortar is set (I did not lubricate it, but was nevertheless able to extract it). Screw a first nut at one of its extremity, then another one 1 cm farther. Insert this rod into the hole, so that the nuts are inside the basin, then fix the rod by adding a washer and a third nut on the other side. Make sure there is enough space to add a fourth nut on top of this last one, as these two nuts will be necessary to extract this temporary guide. It is also important for the guide to stay straight, so ensure you have some supports on which to place the basin so that the guide is not pushed away.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FMU/YLD2/JI4UIF1P/FMUYLD2JI4UIF1P.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FK9/XZRW/JI4UIFNU/FK9XZRWJI4UIFNU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH8/1PD7/JI4UIF3H/FH81PD7JI4UIF3H.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: First Step : Preparing the Mold for the Foot"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "It is now time to mix the concrete with water.

Use  rubber gloves, dust mask and eye protections for your safety. Pour the  water slowly, step by step, and mix thoroughly before adding more water.  Again, the concrete class gives a good visual reference of what a good concrete should look like. Once satisfied with the look, you will have to remove the bubbles that got  trapped in the mix. This is done by vibrating the basin, the best way  being the use of a sanding machine : remove the sanding paper, place  the machine against the basin and move it on all sides. Do not forget  the corners, they are sturdier than the walls, so as a result the bubbles  are more difficult to remove.If you do not have a sanding machine,  you can tap on the basin using anything somewhat heavy, like a small  hammer, a screwdriver handle, etc...  You should see bubbles popping  on the top of the mortar. Keep in mind that, if you choose the same  white look as my post, the last bubbles holes will be filled with wall  putty, so do not worry!

The following instructions are hard to explain, so dot hesitate to refer at the picture! Crumple the paper and put it in the box so that there is a space in the center, to act as the mold for the mortar. The paper folds will give the 'broken' look to the mortar brick. Once satisfied with the look, use some glue to fix the paper, and cover it by a plastic wrap to make it waterproof. Make sure the plastic wrap follows the folds.As you did for the foot, add a piece of threaded rod in the center of the box.Then prepare some more mortar, and pour it into the mold. Use a small stick to ensure the mortar goes everywhere in the folds, but take care to not piercing the plastic layer. Remove the bubbles like we you did for the foot. Again, wrap the mold with plastic to contain the moisture, and let it set for one day only, because we are going to work on it while it is still not to hard.The next day, unmold the brick, and extract the threaded rod. Use the drill to enlarge the hole, so that the brick can slide along the rod. Do this gently to avoid breaking the mortar. There is little chance the brick looks right at this step.

There are two problems to solve : the first one is to to get your cat to like the post, the second one is to get your cat to stop scratching the previous scratching area. In order to maximise the chances your cat uses the post, you will have to place it near the place he likes to be. Furthermore, the post must not be hidden; remember the cat is scratching to mark its territory, so the post must be seen by anyone passing by! As noted in the introduction, you should not have used materials with strong smell, as it could deter the cat from using the post. Let him take some time to get accustomed to this new thing in its living space, and do not force him to use it. It could be useful to show him the post and pet him near it. Try not to grab his pawn in order to mimic a scratching, because this will likely get him stressed, thus make him look at the post with suspicion. I read somewhere that thyme is liked by cats and tends to excite them, so I added some between the cardboards. My cat used the scratching post pretty quickly, but I can not be sure the reason was the thyme!The second problem is to disaccustom your cat from his previous scratching area. Luckily, once the cat starts scratching the post, there are chances he will stop scratching nearby objects. There are some solutions if your cat continues : Apply some perfume on the scratching area, preferably vanilla or lavander, to cover the pheromones it left before.

This is what I did and what helped me after medication was no help at all. You do this on your own risk, even if there seems to be no risk. If you think this might have an impact on your health discuss this with your general practitioner or a specialist. For a long time I suffered asthma, when I was in trouble I had 46% of my lung volume, when everything was alright the volume didn't exceed 69% for almost 20 years. Very demotivating when your doc tells you your lungs are those of an 80 year old at the age of 30. I had to take a lot of medication, much was more harmful to me than to my illness. One time I had to take a lot of cortisone which turned a skinny hunk of 68 kilos into an obese ass of 84 kilos in less than a month. This was a watershed for me, and I tried to find other ways. After some reading I developed a knowledge of dangerous half-truths. I changed my diet and my habits -  I gained to live without cortisone. The next year I managed to live without any medication. This year when I asked my doc to prescribe me a new emergency inhaler because mine had expired (just in case), he asked me to test my lung volume. I was back at 99% (only 2 digits on the measurement device), just my peak flow was at 450 (l/min).This was resoundingly successful for me, and after friends gave me so much positive feedback about my ideas, I want to share them with everybody. But I cannot guarantee that you will have the same success, each anamnesis is individual. Therefor I cannot tell you which one of these steps is vital and which one is superfluously. I can only provide information and hints what you should avoid, change or look after. It took me 3 years to become a healthy person throughout a whole year, be patient and don't go back to old habits because of human tendency to inertia.

Coincidentally they found olfactory receptors, cells to smell. These cells stimulate other cells in our gut to release digestive enzymes. This way the bowel finds the right enzymes for the right food. If it fails, serotonine and histamine will be released. Histamine is involved in processes of our immune system, your medication to lessen your allergic reactions contains antihistamine. Now let's say you eat a yogurt with strawberry flavour, the size of a common cup would allow only 2 strawberry fruits, but that would be too weak for the taste, so flavours had to be added. There are 3 different types of flavourings. Natural, identical and artificial. Natural flavour is extracted from real fruits (expensive), identical strawberry flavour can be made of fir cones for example (cheap), artificial flavours are produced in a chemical process or by genetically modified bacteria and fungi (cheap). Now comes my dangerous knowledge of half-truths, these flavourings might confuse our olfactory receptors, therefor the wrong digestive enzymes will be released, this will cause stress and therefor histamine will be released. As 70% of your body's immune system reside in your bowel, it might be a bad idea to cause stress and confusion there. The other 30%, which include your bronchia and mucosa in eyes and nose, might be affected and therefor confused too. Maybe you should avoid any food with identical or artificial flavours like in ready meals, instant soups, soft-drinks or flavoured yogurt and you might avoid allergies.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FXJ/AR4J/GOE33R9B/FXJAR4JGOE33R9B.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Avoid Flavourings"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": " Most people with asthma have a fungal infection in their lungs, the weakening of the immune system by medication or the vicious circle of a chronic illness makes it easy for bacteria or fungi which are everywhere around us to become a threat to our health. But then you will get cortisone from your doc to widen your airways so you can cough the squatters out. How about you deaden them so your airways widen naturally? Essential oils are known to kill bacteria and fungi, but if you inhale them they will not reach every alveoli in your lungs because many are blocked because of your asthma. When consumed, some essential oils will be processed in your liver or excreted by your kidneys, some oils will make you burp, some will make you fart, but some special essential oils will leave your body only via your lungs. Again, my knowledge of dangerous half-truths, if you eat these essentials oils regularly they will kill the fungi and bacteria in your lungs when leaving your body exiting through your alveoli. Anise, fennel and garlic have lots of those special essential oils. Buy Anise seeds and take a tablespoon for a tea. Save the seeds, put them the next day into a mortar and crush them with a pestle. Add your favorite liquor, stir and then drink the liquid, the most important oils which you can only breathe out are only soluble in alcohol. Save the seeds again and use them for your lunch the next day, they are perfect for gnocchi or pasta. This way you can use them for 3 days and get the best out of it.

Great. Taking a walk in the woods? Fabulous. Having your warts cured by taking a walk in the woods? Priceless.\" - Pefty Ever heard the statistic that \"25% of our medicines come directly from plants\"? Ever wondered which medicines? Ever wondered which plants? Would you be surprised to hear that a very expensive topical medicine for an everyday disease is made from a very common, very recognizable, and very easily processed plant native to forests throughout the eastern USA? Yeah, I was surprised too. The Mayapple plant was already one of my favorite native plants when I found out its medicinal use. It turns out that one of the only known drugs for treatment of genital warts is podophyllotoxin, an alkaloid that the pharma-industrial complex harvests from the only place it can be found in any quantity: the roots of the local native Mayapple plant. Standard pharmaceutical doses range from 0.15% to 0.5% strength, quite similar to the concentrations at which the chemical naturally occurs in Mayapple roots. I decided to try skipping the pharma-industrial complex and prepare a topical ointment of my own. Since similar preparation instructions do not seem to be available anywhere on the web, and since my preparation worked so well (warts were gone in a week, with no detectable side effects), and since it was such a world-changing experience to make use of my natural surroundings in medicinal healing, I decided I owed it to the community to post how I went about it :) \u2650 \u279a \u2197  If you like the intent, execution, and unique subject matter :) please VOTE at upper right \u2197 \u279a \u2650DISCLAIMER:  In the medicinal arena, I can vouch only for my own experience and cannot count myself Hippocratically qualified to recommend treatment to others. This instructable is to be used as a narrative of my experience ONLY, not as how-to cure instructions. In the case I treated, a qualified doctor had identified the case as genital warts caused by HPV and had recommended topical treatment.WARNING FOR MAKERS: Podophyllotoxin is a mitosis disruptor and should be handled with great care. DO NOT EVER INGEST Mayapple plants, and probably don't even handle the roots with your bare hands. Wash immediately with soap and water if you do. Probably don't use the same equipment for PREPARING FOOD that you use for handling Mayapple material. DO NOT BREATHE any dust that you create from Mayapple material, and DO NOT GET ANY IN YOUR EYES.

This treatment is not recommended if you are experiencing any of the following: \u2022 diabetes \u2022 circulation problems \u2022 Raynaud's syndrome \u2022 use of steroid medications such as prednisone, fluticasone (Advair), mometasone (Asmanex, Nasonex), dexamethasone (Decadron, Hexadrol) and others \u2022 pregnancy or breast-feedingWARNING FOR SEXY PEOPLE: Genital warts are contagious. Avoid unprotected* intimate contact if you have genital warts. Surprisingly, even successful wart treatment can't guarantee you won't pass genital warts to others. Talk with your doctor about safe methods of preventing transmission during intimate contact, and then look at the informed consent conversations you'll want to start enjoying with intimate partners.EXHORTATION FOR FORAGERS: Foraging wild plants means leaving plenty for wildlife and other thrifty foragers, being mindful of the natural habitat, asking permission before you pick on private land, and other common courtesies.

That said, if you don't have access to a forest to harvest from, you can usually find Mayapple roots (or \"bulbs\") selling on eBay. This is especially useful during the winter! In fact, Mayapple plants are unusual in that they senesce and go dormant by August, even in areas where the growing season lasts much longer. So if you want to harvest them yourself, it's imperative to get out there between ~April and ~August, depending on your local climate. Mayapple grows in forests throughout eastern North America (for Canada map see here), often in dense patches that contain only Mayapple plants. When they first appear in April their umbrella-like leaves are folded up, but by May the unfurling of their single leaf (or sometimes two leaves) is complete, and a single white flower blooms under the leafy canopy. If fertilized, this flower produces a green ball-shaped fruit known as, you guessed it, the May Apple. Mayapples are common enough that you're likely to encounter them on any hike through the woods in your area, as long as you're in the geographic range marked on this map. When you find a patch of Mayapple plants, take just one or maybe two plants -- this will be plenty, and will leave plenty for sustaining the local population (as well as for other readers of this instructable).

But first let\u2019s look at the 2 types of Acne:1) Non-inflammatory acne Within this type there are;Whitehead \u2013 the trapped sebum (oil) and bacteria stay below the skin surface.Blackhead \u2013 occur when the pore opens to the surface and the sebum (oil), which contains the skin pigment melanin, oxidizes and turns color. It is not dirt and cannot be washed away.2) Inflammatory acne Within this type there are;Papule \u2013 occur when there is a break in the follicular wall. White blood cells rush in and the pore becomes inflamed.Pustule \u2013 forms several days later when white blood cells make their way to the surface of the skin. This is what we refer to as a \"zit\" or a \"pimple\".Cyst \u2013 occur when a severe inflammatory reaction results in very large pus filled lesion.Nodule \u2013 follicle breaks along the bottom, total collapse can occur, causing a large, inflamed bump that can be sore to the touch. Let\u2019s look at it in a simple way - skin cells, sebum (oil), dirt, cosmetics and hair clump together into a plug, this plug becomes infected with bacteria, resulting in a swelling.The Story 5 years ago the company I was working for offered health seminars.\u00a0 One of those seminars was about Acne.\u00a0 I was XX years old and constantly bothered with Nodules.\u00a0 They lasted weeks and they were painful and embarrassing. The instructor brought a PowerPoint presentation and described what was happening with Acne.\u00a0 I listen very closely and learned that science shows that bacteria thrives in the oil and they reproduce like \"Tribbles\".\u00a0 The pores become clogged and your Acne issues begin.\u00a0 Since that seminar, I have not had any Nodules, but because I forget to wash with Antibacterial soap then I see and feel a red spot develop.\u00a0 After a day or 2 of washing with Antibacterial soap it is gone.Antibacterial Time (keep in beat with the song \u201cSugartime\u201d) Acne in the morning Acne in the evening Acne at suppertime Rid me of Acne And everything\u2019ll be fine Home remedy in the morning Home remedy in the evening Home remedy at suppertime Rid me of Acne And everything\u2019ll be fine Antibacterial soap is the answer to your problems, If you do not use it, you may look kind of gruesome, Acne in the morning Acne in the evening Acne at suppertime Rid me of Acne And everything\u2019ll be fine Home remedy in the morning Home remedy in the evening Home remedy at suppertime Rid me of Acne And everything\u2019ll be fine Wash your face, your forehead, Your neck and forget not your shoulders.

After searching high and low for his owner with no luck we decided to take him in as our own.  Since then he has been a constant companion to the both of use, tagging along on evening walks, on cross country car rides, and on our weekend hiking excursions in the warmer months of spring and summer.   As we like to be outdoors and active, we typically keep a small well packed first aid kit with us to deal with minor injuries and occasional emergencies, and although this kit is well equipped for our needs, it occurred to us a while back that it might not be equipped to meet the needs of our little four legged friend.  So we hit the internet, did some research, ordered a book or two, and copied what we thought was useful from commercially produced pet first aid kits to create a kit that we thought would serve the needs of our pet without incorporating a lot of the useless excess that you might find in one of the commercial kits.In this Instructable I will walk you through the process of creating a pet first aid kit for your own furry companion. The kit I describe will mostly be aimed at dog owners, but the concepts and general rationale can be adapted to suit almost any pet.  Throughout the steps I will discuss some of the considerations and philosophies that I utilized when putting my kit together and will of course go over the contents of my Pet first aid kit and there intended uses so that you can use the knowledge to put together a kit of your own.All and all, this is a fairly inexpensive project to put together,  besides a few specialty items like a nice pouch or container to hold the items in the kit, most everything else should be stuff that you already have or things that you can pick up inexpensively at your local convenience/dollar store. Fun Fact: April is pet first aid month, so make sure to keep an eye out around where you live for classes or freebies related to keeping your pets happy and healthy!", "title": "Pet First Aid Kit - Simple, Inexpensive, and Effective", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Pet-First-Aid-Kit-Simple-Inexpensive-and-Effective/", "section": "home", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Picking and choosing what to include in your pet first aid kit can be challenging. you want to try your best to strike a balance between having the things you will need in an emergency, and not having so much that you need a small cart to tote your kit around on. There are a lot of factors that will contribute to what and how much you keep in your first aid kit, things like the size and type of pet you have, how many pets you have, what your intended use for the first aid kit is, (is it a boo-boo kit to take with you to the dog park, or is it a serious first aid kit for hikes/camping or extended vacations.) I cover my bases by having two separate first aid kits, a small kit with essential items for daily use, and a large more comprehensive kit that I bring along when we go on trips or out into the woods.Here are some rules to follow as you put your first aid kit together: Keep it simple: Someone is going to post in the comments that I forgot to include ridiculous things like a suture kit, scalpel, or a pet defibrillator (I don't even know if that's a real thing), but the point here is that 99% of the time you won't need severe medical equipment. Just pack the basics and the things that you think you'll actually need/use and leave the other stuff behind. The extra weight and hassle of going overboard on supplies usually means that you'll end up leaving your kit at home and therefore won't have anything on hand to help you out in an emergency situation. I'll be covering what things I think are worth adding to your pet first aid kit in the next few steps, so don't worry if you're drawing a blank about what to include right now. I'm also hoping to get some great suggestions of actual useful things that I may have forgotten to mention via the comments section, so if you're reading through this instructable and you find yourself thinking, \"He should have included X\", please make sure to mention X and it's uses in the comments. Don't Duplicate Unnecessarily: in order to keep your kit trim and effective it is important that you don't over load it with items that serve the same function. For example, if you have a Swiss arm knife with scissors in your pet first aid kit, you might not need to pack an additional dedicated pair of shears. Likewise, if you have gauze and tape, then you can probably forego incorporating large bandages as the gauze and tape will serve the same function. Pick Items with Multiple Uses: Using one item or tool for two or three jobs can be a great way to keep your pet first aid kit simple and effective. For example, Swiss Army Knives pack an absurd amount of tools into a small space; towels can be used to dry, for warmth, or can be cut into strips for rags and bandaging; and cling tape can be used to hold bandages in place or can be combined with other materials to make an impromptu splint. Keep in mind the size of your pet: If you have a tea cup Chihuahua, you probably won't need gigantic bandages or leashes strong enough to hold back a charging rhinoceros. Although for the sake of being a good Samaritan and all around responsible pet person, you might want to pack a few extra items for various types/sizes of pets so that you can help other pets besides your own. This will be a trade off between how much you want to carry verses how prepared you want to be. Depending on your situation/intended use, it might be okay to combine your human and pet first aid kits:  If you're a prepared person who always like to keep a normal first aid kit on hand for those unexpected situations, you might be able to upgrade your kit to include pets by adding a few simple items or by stocking extra of some items you already carry. This could be useful if you're into ultralight hiking or if you simple don't have a ton of room to carry a fully decked out pet first aid kit.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F50/72XI/I8BGR69E/F5072XII8BGR69E.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Philosophy - What Should Be in a Pet First Aid Kit?"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The type of container/bag you choose for your pet first aid kit can greatly affect the function of your kit in an emergency situation. Here are some considerations that should help you to pick the right container for the job:At Home or On The Go:  Where will your kit be used?  if it's a stationary at home kit a hard plastic container with an easy to remove lid might be all you need.  If it's an on the go kit (like the one presented in this Instructable,) I would lean towards a durable pouch or bag that will be able to protect it's contents and hold up well against the wear and tear of daily carry.Size and Weight : If you pick a container that is too big or too heavy you WILL end up leaving your pet first aid kit at home as it will be a burden to bring along.  Pick containers that are lightweight but strong, and that are just big enough to fit everything you need.Dumpability : This is something that i find to be very important.  In an emergency situation I want the ability to dump everything in my first aid kit out so that I don't have to waste time rummaging through the contents of the kit in a small enclosed space.  For my first aid kit I used a simple but effective single pocket zipper bag.  it's big enough to fit everything I need and in an emergency I can unzip it and dump it to have quick access to what I need in just a few moments.Durability : Pick a container/bag that will stand up to daily use.  Something like a Ziploc bag will be to flimsy for the job and will quickly wear out after just a few outings.  In my opinion Canvas/Nylon tool pouches are the way to go, they're strong, light weight, and built to last.  The one I picked for this project is a Klein Codura Tool Bag which can be found on Amazon.com for about 10 dollars.Visibility:  Having your pet first aid kit clearly and visibly labelled can be vitally important.  Something like an indiscreet black nylon pouch will not be immediately recognizable as a pet first aid kit in the event that you have to send some one to retrieve your kit while your are attending to your injured animal. To this end it is very important to label your kit in some way,  it could be as simple as an iron on first aid patch which you can pick up for a few bucks on Amazon, or you could create your own if your handy with a sewing machine. This will be discussed in more detail in the next step.Water Resistance:  Finding ways to water proof your kit or the items inside of it is one of the most important things you can do to keep your pet first aid kit effective and ready to go when you need it.  The easiest solution is to pick a container or pouch that is already water proof.  For home or car kits,  a great solution is to use a locking, sealing food storage contain, think \"Tuperware.\"  For on the go kits I suggest picking pouch or bag that has some built in water resistance, and then doubling your defenses by storing items that might be damaged by moisture in plastic bags.  One other tip I can give is to check your old shoe boxes for \"Silica Descant Packs\", (the little white packages with small beads in them that say \"Do Not Eat\".  You can tuck a few of these packages inside your Pet First Aid Kit to absorb any water or humidity that might be harmful to the items within.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FX0/JYT4/I84BG1QA/FX0JYT4I84BG1QA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F26/TKWC/I84BG1RY/F26TKWCI84BG1RY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPF/X2VG/I84BG0IN/FPFX2VGI84BG0IN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2K/TCFF/I84BG1U4/F2KTCFFI84BG1U4.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Containers and Bags"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "One of the most important things about a first aid kit whether it be for humans or for animals is that it is easy to identify in an emergency.  If the scenario plays out that your are tending to your injured pet and you need to send someone to retrieve your Pet First Aid Kit, you don't want that person wasting valuable time trying to find an nondescript bag or box of medical supplies.  To that end I created a custom, highly visible, pet first aid patch for the front of my kit. This kit will all anyone to recognize the kit at a moments notice, saving valuable time in the event of an emergency.To make the patch I source images from Google of pet silhouettes and the first aid symbol.  Then, in Photoshop, I merged and fine tuned the images to create the look of the patch.  Once I had the patch looking good I used a special program called, \"SewArt\" to turn a JPEG image file of the patch into a PES file which can be read by Brother embroidery machines.  with the PES file ready to go I put my embroidery machine to work and about an hour later had a custom patch ready to adorn my kit.  This, of course, was a lot of extra work and I really only did it because I was interested to learn how to make PES files, and because I was writing this instructable and wanted to produce the highest quality end result possible.  In-loo of designing a custom patch, you could also purchase a standard first aid patch and combine it with another pet related patch, sewing both to the outside of your kit.  this would accomplish the same goal and would be just a little simpler, plus there are tons of awesome pouches out there on sites like Amazon and Ebay.If you're interested in making your own patch, or if you'd like to learn how to change JPEG images to PES so that they can be used with an embroidery machine, there is a really fantastic video on Youtube that explains the whole process very well.

Some of these items can be used as expected and others have unique uses specific to pet medical needs.  Also, some things like self adhesive band aids have been omitted or are included in reduced numbers in my pet first aid kit as I find that the adhesive can pull hair upon removal and I find that a combination of Tefla pads (nonstick) and Self Adhesive Cling Tape can accomplish the same task better.Rubbing Alcohol or Alcohol Pads:  Quite possibly the most useful thing you can keep in your pet first aid kit!  Alcohol pads are going to serve to main functions, the first is pretty obvious, they are a great way to clean and sterilize wounds and tools.  The other use is a little unexpected but may just save your pet's life.  On hot days heat stroke can strike dogs quickly in severely.  As dogs can't perspire through their skin, they have difficulty shedding excess body heat and can quickly succumb to heat on hot days.  Wiping the paw pads of a dog or cat who is suffering from heat stroke with rubbing alcohol can save their life.  as the alcohol evaporates the transition from liquid to gas pulls heat cooling the overheated animal and potentially saving it's life.Tefla Pads: These are basically upgraded gauze pads that resist sticking to wounds (anybody who has had to remove a gauze pad from a dried wound will know how important the \"non stick\" feature is.  These come individually packaged and sterile so they are ready to use at a moments notice.Self Adhesive Cling Tape:  an upgrade from standard medical tape, this tape only adheres to itself and therefore is idea of wrapping wounds on pets where standard tape might rip or pull at fur.Band Aids: As mentioned above, I don't keep a lot of these in the pet first aid kit as I simply don't find a lot of uses for them where Tefla Pads and Cling tape aren't better suited. That being said, I do keep a few if for no other reason that they're nice to have if I get injured tending to my pet, (otherwise I have to break out the human first aid kit and that can be a bother for something as simple as a band aid.)Triple Antibiotic Ointment:  Most people refer to this as Neosporin, it's highly effective at diminishing the chance of infection in open wounds.Saline Solution: great for washing out wounds or eyes prior to applying antibiotic ointment.Medications:  This can be a tricky area to advise upon.  Any medication that is prescribed by veterinarians is most likely safe to pack, but be very cautious of using human medication to treat your pets. Certain human medications can be used in smaller doses for pets without issue, but certain medications that are harmless to humans can be fatal if administered to a pet.  For example, Tylenol headache medication is poisonous to cats, even in small doses. About the only medication that I keep in my kit is a few tablets of Benadryl which is useful fro stings, bites, and minor allergies or skin irritations.  Collapsible Water Bowl: I picked up the one that I keep in my kit for around 6 dollars on amazon. it's a simple, lightweight, and inexpensive  tool that helps to keep my little buddy well hydrated.Syringe: Combined with purified water or a saline solution, a small syringe can be an invaluable tool for rinsing wounds or eyes. Plus they are very inexpensive, running about .35 cents at your local pet store.Rubber Gloves: For keeping your hands clean while tending to your pet, or they fingers can be cut off and placed over a dressed paw wound to keep it waterproof.Styptic Pencil: Stopping bleeding from a broken nail/claw.Cotton Balls or Swabs: Cleaning ears or around wounds.3% Hydrogen Peroxide: For cleaning wounds or inducing vomiting (consult your vet).Ice pack/Hot pack: Reducing swelling and relaxing inflamed muscles.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSW/T42D/I84BFX9Z/FSWT42DI84BFX9Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0K/PR9M/I84BFXA1/F0KPR9MI84BFXA1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUJ/QZD4/I84BFWHA/FUJQZD4I84BFWHA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB4/S6YQ/I84BFXAD/FB4S6YQI84BFXAD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD6/7WG1/I84BFXC4/FD67WG1I84BFXC4.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Medical Related"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Tools and medical supplies go hand in hand, but for the sake of keeping things organized I've broken them into their own individual categories.  Tweezers: Pulling thorns or removing ticks.  Note, if you're going to use tweezers to pull ticks, I suggest that you purchase and use ultra fine tip tweezers as these will allow you to grip and pull the head of the tick as opposed to gripping and potentially ripping the body of the tick which would be more likely to happen with blunt nosed tweezers. What ever way you decide to go (Pointy Nosed or Blunt Nosed), make sure you pack a GOOD pair of tweezers as their is nothing more frustrating than trying to deal with a cheap pair of tweezers that barely grab anything while your pet is thrashing about or in pain.Safety Pins: Removing Splinters.Swiss Army Knife: In terms of the amount of awesome that can be fit in the smallest possible space, you can't do much better than a Swiss Army Knife:  If you're putting together an ultra light weight pet first aid kit, a good Swiss Army Knife (SAK) can cover most of your tool needs.  a model like the Victorinox Explorer, can be picked up for right around 20 dollars on Amazon or Ebay and will include multiple first aid related tools like a knife, scissors, tweezers, a saw, a magnifying an awl, a pin, and even some Phillips and flat head drivers.  The knife and saw can be utilized to free leashes that are hopelessly entangled in brush, the scissors can be used to process first aid materials like gauze, or can be used to remove painful matted hair, the magnifying glass can provide a close look at wounds or irritations, the tweezers and pin can remove splinters, shards, and ticks, the awl can punch a new hole in a broken collar.Pet Nail Trimmers:  I don't know if I would include these in a light duty kit, but they would definitely come along for long trips or hikes.  There are all types of nail trimmers but the best in my opinion are Miller's Forge style trimmers, (these trimmers resemble scissors except that the cutting edge is short and semicircular.)Flashlight:  Flashlights can really save the day during a pet emergency.  They're great for getting a better look at a wound and can help you to find a lost pet in failing light.Whistle: For signaling your pet or calling for help.Shears: Although I really like the small scissors on the Swiss Army Knife, a dedicated pair of shears is also very useful.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2L/1X5M/I84BFXVA/F2L1X5MI84BFXVA.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Tools"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Beyond carrying the tools and materials needed for first aid, it's also a good idea to incorperate important information into your kit.

I don't like to depend on my phone in an emergency situation as it could be dead or broken, so the things I keep on it are generally supplemental to what is in the kit, i.e. if my dog were to run away while on an outing, I might keep several hard copy pictures to give to park personnel and I might use a picture on my phone when questioning if anyone had seen him.Here are some simple pieces of information that you should keep in your kit to help you in an emergency situation.Pictures of my Pets (Both hard copy and digital)Vet Contact InformationPoison Control InformationA Pocket Pet First Aid Reference ManualMicrochip InformationCopies of Vaccination RecordsInformation and location information regarding nearest emergency animal hospital", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FUI/3ZAW/I8BGR65Z/FUI3ZAWI8BGR65Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL1/BPCO/I8BGR662/FL1BPCOI8BGR662.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1C/MA7O/I8BGR65W/F1CMA7OI8BGR65W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAN/AK89/I8BGR66L/FANAK89I8BGR66L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZY/POSJ/I8BGR66M/FZYPOSJI8BGR66M.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Paperwork and Digital Resources"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "Besides having the necessary first aid equipment, it's also a good idea to add a few just in case items to your Pet first aid kit.

(useful for handling lost dogs or for replacing your own broken leash.)Small/Medium Sized Towel: Very handy for drying off wet pets after romps through the water.  Can also be used for warms. Additionally, if you need to dump your kit to find something asap, you can spread the towel out so that the kits contents are on the towel and not on the ground which would help to keep things clean and accounted for.Treats: Injured animals can be scared and therefore unwilling to allow your approach to tend to their needs.  Teats are a great way to coax in a frightened animal or just a great way to get your pets attention in the event that they should escape their leash and start high tailing it through the park.Muzzle: Injured pets can snap and bite while being treated.  a muzzle can keep them under control while you apply first aid.  Note, do not use a muzzle if there is any type of airway restriction associated with the injury.Small Bottle of Detergent or Bar of Soap: when were away from home on hiking trips, Tucker sometimes ends up dirty, either from playing in a creek or from finding something unpleasant to roll in. a little bit of soap can be very useful, especially if you happen to have a bit of running water near by.Lotion: Can be useful for dried or cracked paws and skin.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FBH/D2U0/I84BFY0I/FBHD2U0I84BFY0I.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Just in Case Items"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Thank you for taking the time to check out my instructable on how to assemble a Pet First Aid Kit.

With this code, we aim to use the appearance of blood vessel leak spots as an indicator of background diabetic retinopathy, though further diagnosis techniques would be required in the real world. The goal of this code is to automate image processing and diagnosing of retinal images to identify signs of diabetic retinopathy shown through dark spots in the retinal images.10 normal retinal images and 10 diagnosed retinal images were processed through a code that first reads and filters the images and then quantifies the dark spots to determine if diabetic retinopathy symptoms are present, based on a given threshold.

Foreign Materials- Sewing your sub-dermal skin layer shut while foreign materials are inside is a big NO NO. If you close a piece of foreign material in the sub-dermal layer of skin (Under your layers of skin) you will be visiting hospital in the near future whether you like it or not. The human body is able to expel foreign material via abscesses and pustules in the uppermost layers of your skin eg. Zits.

Though I am by no means an expert, here are some of the things I learned along the way.Lessons Learned Part 1:\n-I found it's cheaper to buy fiberglass resin and cloth it in the automotive section than the boat section of a hardware store. This might be a regional phenomenon, but keep it in mind when shopping for materials.\n-Thin cloth works better than thick cloth for this project. You will have to use two layers of the thinner stuff, but it picks up detail much better than the thicker cloths.\n-Do it outside.\u00a0\n-On that note, weather does affect the curing time of fiberglass. So if you're doing this over a span of a few days and the resin is behaving differently, know that not only temperature but humidity as well will change things.\n-Try not to touch wet resin with the gloves. The resin from the cloth will stick to it, and soon you'll be covered in little white hairs which are surprisingly strong.\n-Fiberglass gets hot as it's curing.

When I say \"mold\" I'm using the term to mean a basic form from which you can make more masks of the same form.\u00a0Calling it a sculpt may be more accurate, but as I did little sculpting the term feels inappropriate.\u00a0\nIt doesn't matter what you make this out of since you'll be using this as a base for the fiberglass, and removing it after. Work with whatever you are most comfortable with. It may help to build over one of those cheap blank masks you can get at craft stores. For those curious about my exact technique, I used Google Sketch to draft a basic head shape, then printed it using Pepakura and put it together (tutorials for this can be found here too!). From there, I used paper mache to smooth out the sharp angles, and then covered it all with plaster cloth for detailing and refining the shape. Regardless of whether or not you are making the jaw movable you should sculpt the whole head; chin, jaws, and all.\nThe only part that really needs to be aligned with your face is the eyes. Make sure that the bottom part of the eyes are where your eyes will be when wearing the mask. The mask's eyes will fall to either side of your own, resulting in sight holes in the tear duct area of the mask. This is known as tear-duct vision.\nKeep in mind that the finished piece will be larger than this mold, due to both the fiberglass and the fur that will be glued on top of it. Basically, you are constructing the skull of the animal.

Poke it through the eye holes, and wrap it around the edges. Tape may help it lie flatter in curvy areas. Make sure everything is covered to prevent the mask from sticking to the mold. Then, draw a line down the center of the mask with a marker, running between the eyes, down the nose, and up the chin. This will result in two halves of the mask which will be joined later.\nPrepare the fiberglass as instructed. If you haven't worked with fiberglass before, check out step 2. First, brush a layer of resin over the surface of one side of the mask, right up to where you marked the line. Then begin adding small squares of fiberglass cloth about 1 1/2 to 2 inches wide to the surface of the mold, applying resin as you go. Try not to leave the edge of the cloth on a convex curve, because it may result in a sharp edge. A sharp edge can be fixed easily with sanding, but it's easier just to avoid.\nOnly place one layer of the fiberglass cloth on top of the mask at this stage. Later a second layer will be added. When the resin has fully cured, gently pull the half free from the mold. Most of the tinfoil will come free in the mask half itself...but the mask should not stick to the mold.

It is possible, but they get in the way and can be attached just as easily at the end (and this will prevent you from nearly breaking them multiple times).\nI used a tinfoil base to form the basic shape, then covered that in plaster.\u00a0I used\u00a0e-pandemic's idea here: https://www.instructables.com/id/ram-horns/step3/making-ridges/ \u00a0 to create raised ridges on my otherwise smooth horns. I painted them black, then dry brushed grey over the raised areas for some added dimension. Finally, they were coated in fiberglass resin for strength.\nAttaching the horns is easy, but should really be done just before you start to add fur to the mask. Start out by laying them against the mask the way you want them to lay. It may help to glue down tinfoil wedges to make the horns stick out even further. Once you have them how you want them, glue them securely in place. Then, paint a layer of fiberglass resin directly over the glue. Place a layer of fiberglass cloth over that, overlapping it onto both the horns and the base of the mask. Apply fiberglass resin over the cloth.

I was having fun and was excited to get done, and neglected my picture taking capabilities.\nThe idea here is that the jaw of the mask fits under your own chin. After a hinge is added, opening your mouth should push down on the jaw and result in the mask's mouth opening. Adding elastics will make it close. This is the most difficult step, because the more exact the jaw comes out, the more sensitive the jaw movement will be.\nBegin by constructing the hinge itself. Cut four pieces of your chosen hinge material, metal or plastic, into thin strips 2''-3'' long. The width of the strips will depend on the strength of the chosen material. For a smoother look, cut curves into the pieces to mimic the creature's jaw line. Overlap the two pieces close to the end, and drill a hole slightly larger than the bolts. The bolts are basically\u00a0 going to be used as rivets, and need to be able to spin freely in the hole (without falling through). Put a washer on the end of the bolt, slide it through the first layer, then add another washer and the last layer of material (see picture).

You won't make that mistake.\nThe hinges have to be attached to a flat surface. Unless your creature has interesting bone structure, odds are there are no good flat areas to mount a hinge on. Remedy this by gluing a large piece of tinfoil at the edge of the mask by the mouth. Press it into a desired shape, then flatten the surface with a flat object. This should result in a smooth surface. Do it on both sides of the mask, making sure that the two sides are as parallel with each other as possible. The closer they are to parallel, the better range of motion you'll end up with. Once you have it lined up satisfactorily, brush fiberglass resin over the top of the tinfoil. This will give the hinges a strong base to mount on.\nBut you're not quite ready to mount the hinges yet. Draw a line along the mask where you want the mouth to open. Using the dremel cut along this line, through the tinfoil mounts, and an inch or two past them. This way you don't have to worry about damaging the hinges (unlike those horns).\nFinally, lay the hinges over their mounts and drill holes on both the top and the bottom piece all the way through the mask. It may help to glue it down first to prevent it from wiggling out of the way. This is where those spare bolts and nuts come into play. Drill at least two holes on both the top and bottom, and drill diagonally from each other for added strength. Slide the bolts through heads out- these ones should not pivot- and screw on the nuts, tightly. Just to be safe, I fiberglassed over the ends of the nuts to prevent them from unscrewing.\u00a0\nYour mask should look smooth from the outside, but resemble Frankenstein's monster on the inside. Cut the end of the bolt off as close to the base as possible using the dremel. Some sanding may be needed to keep it smooth, as well as padding.\nAlso, try it on now before you cut the jaw all the way off. The hinges should fall somewhere around your ears, where your real jaw is hinged. This will result in the most natural looking movement. If the placement is good, use the dremel and follow the line you drew to cut the jaw all the way off. If it falls open when you're done, you did it right. If it doesn't quite open, or seems to grind a bit as opening, loosen the lock nuts on the hinges. If the jaw wiggles back and forth and doesn't line back up, tighten the lock nuts. Play around with it and you should be able to find the perfect balance of being loose enough to open, yet tight enough to line back up.\nLoop a rubber band over the nose and put the mask on.

At this point, a little bit of planning ahead is necessary. The elastics can't be placed too far back towards the hinge, or else they won't be strong enough to close the jaw. Using stronger elastics results in a mouth that's too hard to open. However, you don't want the elastic too far forward towards the mouth, or else it will be visible when you open your creation's mouth.\u00a0Unless the snout of your creature is really long, I found the best spot to place the elastic is right in front of your natural jaw. The mouth of your creature will probably end around there when furred, and it makes the elastics easy to access if they ever need to be changed. \u00a0\nMark where you want the elastics to go directly on the mask. Then, get the drill and switch the bit to match the bolt. It's best if the bit is slightly small, just wide enough to let the bolt through. Drill two holes on each side of the mask- one on the jaw and one immediately above it on the main part of the mask. Take the bolts and slide them all the way through so they stick into the mask, about a centimeter or so. I used barrel bolts (also called Chicago bolts in other regions) because they have a smoother surface and a tab on the end to keep the elastic from rolling off.\nYou should now have four bolts projecting into the mask, two on each side.

Start out by wrapping a very thin layer of your molding material (clay, moldable plastic, etc.) \u00a0around the edges of the mouth, only as far up as you plan to have exposed (about up to where the elastics are). Texture/shape it as needed, but don't worry about strength because fiberglass resin will later be applied. For the roof and bottom of the mouth, just press your molding material into shape, blending it in with the edges of the lips. Texture will be added later with a glue gun. For the roof of the mouth, it's easier to blend the edges with the lips first, then slowly stretch up and out into the desired form.\nFor teeth, press pieces of the molding material into desired shape gently push them into place around the edges of the mouth. Don't push down too hard, or else you might deform the tooth or mouth itself. Resin or glue can be added later as needed to keep the teeth in. When everything is aligned to your satisfaction (and your material has dried), ridges can be created by \"drawing\" with the hot glue gun. Using constant pressure, draw lines horizontally across the mouth between the teeth.Lessons Learned Part 6:\n- If you make a mistake with the glue gun while creating the ridges, don't try to go back and smooth it over with the gun.\u00a0\nIt's nearly impossible to create a finished edge this way. Instead, wait for it to cool and peel it off, then try again.\nThe ridges may look messy now, but with a coat of paint they will look fine. Once everything is cooled and dried, paint it the desired colors. Paint the lips and mouth interior before the teeth, so you don't have to touch the teeth up later. Once the paint is dry, brush a layer of resin over everything. Make sure that the coat of resin is thinner on the teeth to preserve detail, but thicker around the base of the teeth to hold them in place.\nIf desired, create a tongue out of the modeling material or fabric (I used vinyl which is not pictured) and glue it in place.\nThe nose was sculpted in a similar manner. First, draw some guidelines directly on the mask to get an idea of dimensions. It's also a good idea to use the dremel to drill holes in the mask for added air circulation and\u00a0realism. Then, either press the modeling material into desired shape, or make it separate and glue it on afterwards. Keep in mind that once fur is added, the surface of the mask will be closer to the nose, so it is a good idea to make the nose project about a centimeter farther than you actually want it to appear.\u00a0\nFor added skin texture, I wrapped the nose up in pleather and glued it in place. There was a convenient wrinkle in the nose which I placed between the nostrils.\u00a0", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2F/LET5/H6S4GC05/F2FLET5H6S4GC05.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN5/2E9X/H6S4GC39/FN52E9XH6S4GC39.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF2/3YYP/H6S4GC3A/FF23YYPH6S4GC3A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU1/9CDX/H6S4GC3C/FU19CDXH6S4GC3C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVP/42MP/H6S4GC3B/FVP42MPH6S4GC3B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNX/0CF4/H6S4GC3D/FNX0CF4H6S4GC3D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUA/GUS2/H6S4GC3E/FUAGUS2H6S4GC3E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F31/RLCO/H6S4GC3F/F31RLCOH6S4GC3F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZS/0AF4/H6S4GC3H/FZS0AF4H6S4GC3H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM8/KPJX/H6S4GC3G/FM8KPJXH6S4GC3G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1A/TX9D/H6S4GC3K/F1ATX9DH6S4GC3K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXM/O0NB/H6S4GC3M/FXMO0NBH6S4GC3M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZJ/T9Q3/H6WG6QEV/FZJT9Q3H6WG6QEV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9Q/UL98/H6WG6QEU/F9QUL98H6WG6QEU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDQ/IYC0/H6WG6QF8/FDQIYC0H6WG6QF8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F14/690I/H6WG6QFL/F14690IH6WG6QFL.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 11: Details- Teeth, Lips, and Nose"}, {"step": 12, "steps_text": "Again, if you are looking for how to make the eyes, a link will be inserted here when that Instructable is up. This is how to apply eyes to the mask.\nAdding the eyes takes a lot of trial and error, because a few millimeters can be the difference between good vision and the inability to see anything. \u00a0Start out by trying on your mask and getting a feel for the range of vision. If your vision is obstructed anywhere, I highly\u00a0recommend\u00a0shaving down that area with a dremel now, before you even add the eyes. Some blind spots are unavoidable, such as the ones that may occur with the mask's nose and eye sockets, but trim it back as far as\u00a0aesthetically\u00a0possible. It's also a good idea to widen the eye holes, particularly closer to the nose since that's where your main vision will occur.\u00a0\nStart out by placing the eyes on the mask where you want them to be. Lightly glue them in place with the glue gun if necessary. Take a look at the space between the eye itself and the mask's nose. This is the area that you will be looking out of. Try the mask on. If you don't have much of a range of vision, consider moving the eyes further apart or shaving off more of the mask. Remember that the vision will be reduced even further with the addition of sculpted details.\nOnce the eyes are in a position that maximizes both vision range and appearance, mark where they were on the mask and pull them out. Wrap a thin layer of your modeling material around the edge (rim) of the eye. Place them back in the mask and press down, using glue if necessary to keep them securely in place. Then, wrap the edge of the eye hole up in the modeling material as well. Take a strip of the modeling material and connect the top of the eye with the outer corner of the eye hole (see pictures for clarification). Repeat on both sides and do the same on the bottom. This will create the basic structure of the mask's \"eyelid.\"\u00a0\nRepeat this process for the tear duct area, but flatten the strip against the side of the mask. Make it as smooth and flat as possible to minimize view obstruction. Detail and paint as desired and (you guessed it!) brush a layer of fiberglass resin over the sculpted parts, being careful to not allow any resin on the surface of the eye itself.\nIf desired, add further bone detail around the eye using tinfoil as a base and brushing resin over the top. Be aware that details like this may restrict vision even more. For reference, with the additions you see in the picture I can't see out of the side of the mask, thus eliminating my peripheral vision. However, the blind spot due to the nose is almost unnoticeable despite the nose's width, and I am able to see down and out of the mouth for climbing stairs or particularly rough footing.\nWhen you try the mask on, take a moment to adjust to the blind spots. Don't just put it on and assume that you won't be able to see at all. It's surprising how quickly you can adapt to the new vision restrictions, to the point of being able to walk around almost like normal. I wouldn't go for a jog in the woods wearing the mask, but walking around in a crowd on fairly even ground should be fine as long as you are careful.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F0F/IV9Z/H6S41C0Q/F0FIV9ZH6S41C0Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLH/W23D/H6S4GCPC/FLHW23DH6S4GCPC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOW/M12K/H6S4GCQ6/FOWM12KH6S4GCQ6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBR/ESW7/H6S4GCRS/FBRESW7H6S4GCRS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F17/LUS0/H6S4GCU4/F17LUS0H6S4GCU4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZI/4489/H6S4GCU7/FZI4489H6S4GCU7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRV/E7WC/H6WG6QB2/FRVE7WCH6WG6QB2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH9/EL0P/H6WG6QB3/FH9EL0PH6WG6QB3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 12: Details- Eyes"}, {"step": 13, "steps_text": "If you've never worked with fake fur before, a great way to get used to it is by making the ears of your mask first. This way, if any mistakes are made very little fabric is wasted.\nAlso, unless it is the only kind you have, don't use a high heat glue gun. The temperature can actually melt the fur (remember, fake fur is basically plastic) into an unusable mass of chunky hair. If you only own a high heat glue gun, test it out on a small piece of scrap fur first.\nStart out by creating the basic form for the ears. I used wire mesh so that I would be able to bend and pose the ears even after attaching them to the mask. Any modeling material would work as well. If you do use wire mesh make sure to fold the cut edges in, because the edges can be sharp and poke holes in the fabric...or you.\u00a0\nOnce you have the shape you want, I\u00a0recommend making a basic \"pattern\" for the ear so you don't end up wasting fabric. Take any piece of scrap paper or fabric and simply fold it around the ear (see the pictures). Cut off any excess paper, leaving a only a slight overlap. This will be the basic shape of the piece of fabric you cut- generally a square or rectangular piece depending on the dimensions of the ear.\nBefore you move on to cut the fabric, there is something else you need to consider. The fur of the fabric will all be pointing in one direction, called the grain. When you construct the mask, you want to make sure that the grain of the fur is in the same direction for all pieces, otherwise you'll end up with awkward gaps and ridges in the fur. Generally speaking, on an animal the fur starts at the nose and points towards the head, and from the head points to the back. If you do an image search for \"animal fur direction\" there are some excellent images that help illustrate this point.\u00a0\nBasically, what I'm saying is be careful what direction the fur is pointing, otherwise it might not lay properly.\u00a0\nWhen cutting the fur, make sure that the grain is pointing towards the tip of the ear. Not only is this a more natural look, but it makes it easier to blend in the base of the ear with the rest of the head. I drew arrows on the underside of the fabric to help keep me straight. Lay down your pattern with the top of the ear \"pointing\" in the direction of the grain and cut it out.Lessons Learned Part 5:\n- When cutting fur, cut on the backside of the fur with a box-cutting knife or other bladed implement,\u00a0not\u00a0scissors. Scissors cut the fur down short around the edges, which makes it nearly impossible to hide the seams. They also make a mess.\nMine came out in a diamond sort of shape. From there, I placed the wire mesh on the backside of the fabric and glued first the center, then the edges in place. I then carefully folded the rest of the fabric inwards, gluing and trimming overlapping edges as I went. In the end, you should end up with something with no loose fabric, no raw edges, and a desperate need for a haircut.\u00a0\nUnfortunately, I did not take progress pictures for trimming the fur for the ear, but see the \"Trimming the Fur\" steps for some tips on how to do it. Again, photo references can help to make the ear more realistic.\u00a0", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FKB/HFFA/H6WG6QIP/FKBHFFAH6WG6QIP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZP/SXJ9/H6WG6QIQ/FZPSXJ9H6WG6QIQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIS/I4KM/H6WG6QIR/FISI4KMH6WG6QIR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCP/TDO2/H6WG6QIS/FCPTDO2H6WG6QIS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZU/GBNR/H6WG6QIT/FZUGBNRH6WG6QIT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLZ/93BM/H6WG6QIU/FLZ93BMH6WG6QIU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQO/XFU4/H6WG6QIV/FQOXFU4H6WG6QIV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FT8/R230/H6WG6QIW/FT8R230H6WG6QIW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW5/X5UO/H6WG6QIX/FW5X5UOH6WG6QIX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB1/7OGC/H6WG6QIY/FB17OGCH6WG6QIY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOV/KFE4/H6WG6QJ1/FOVKFE4H6WG6QJ1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FT5/4XPK/H6WG6R4J/FT54XPKH6WG6R4J.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 13: Fur Part 1- Ears"}, {"step": 14, "steps_text": "Since this mask sits on your head more or less like a helmet, a hood helps both hide the wearer and keep the mask in place.\nI had a pattern from an old ninja costume for constructing a hood which covers all of the head except the eyes. Cutting larger eye holes resulted in a hood which fit around the edges of the mask and kept a nice shape in the back. For those of us without ninja mask, winter warmth mask, or balaclava patterns hanging around, Simplicity has a guide to making \"Ninja Costume Hoods\" here:\u00a0http://www.simplicity.com/t-how-to-make-ninja-hood.aspx. There are also a couple of Instructables here on making ninja masks, but out of stretchy material. Most Faux fur has no stretch whatsoever, so while these tutorials will\u00a0definitely\u00a0help with fitting, keep in mind that a zipper or some other fastener will be necessary.\u00a0\nSee my third and fourth pictures for help with clarification. Since the fur should be pointing back towards the body of the wearer, the fur grain should be parallel with the \"chin\" area of the mask. This means that once applied to the mask, the fur will be pointing backwards from the chin, cheeks, and forehead. When being worn, the fur around the shoulders will wrap around and drape down, following the lines drawn in the diagram. If your pattern has the little extra triangles for shoulder padding that mine did, the fur should point towards the bottom edge of the triangle.\u00a0\nOnce everything is cut out, it may be easier to sew by hand. Don't bother trying to finish the seams by rolling the edges, because fake\u00a0fur generally does not unravel. Place the two halves furry sides together and sew the entire chin seam, and only five inches or so on the top seam (from the edge of the face back). Brush the fur over the seam, to pull out any hair that got caught in it and effectively hide the seam. Then, wrap the face opening of the hood around the edges of your mask, trimming if necessary to make it fit. The hood should wrap snugly around the entire outer edge of the mask, with a 1/2 inch to 1 inch overlap for gluing. Begin to glue the fur down with the glue gun from the top of the head down. Don't glue over the hinges themselves, but make sure that the fur fits snugly around them.\nAfter you've glued the fur down to the surface of the mask, glue along the inside edge for extra security.\u00a0\nAt this point you may be tempted to give your mask a haircut, but you should really wait until the whole face has fur.\nTo close the two panels, sew in some sort of fastener. I used hook clasps (also called \"frog\" clasps) and sewed them in every couple of inches on the inside of the fabric. Use whatever fastener you're most familiar with. Don't worry about hiding the stitches either, because they should\u00a0disappear\u00a0under the length of the fur.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8K/0MGZ/H6WG6R5W/F8K0MGZH6WG6R5W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ4/IEPY/H6WG6R5X/FJ4IEPYH6WG6R5X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFA/U7PJ/H6WG6R5Y/FFAU7PJH6WG6R5Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3Z/274X/H6WG6R62/F3Z274XH6WG6R62.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1D/UMJR/H6WG6R64/F1DUMJRH6WG6R64.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUR/YKIS/H6WG6R66/FURYKISH6WG6R66.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUV/MACA/H6WG6R68/FUVMACAH6WG6R68.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRM/MAWZ/H6WG6R69/FRMMAWZH6WG6R69.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8A/NH37/H6WG6R6A/F8ANH37H6WG6R6A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFB/GOGY/H6WG6R65/FFBGOGYH6WG6R65.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 14: Fur Part 2- the Hood"}, {"step": 15, "steps_text": "The biggest thing I can say to you for this step is to take your time. It did take me one full afternoon just to lay down the fur right. If you rush this, the only way to fix any mistakes is to pull all the fur off and do it again. Take it slow and get it right the first time. There is also an exorbitant amount of pictures for this step to help you along the way.\nIt may help to roughly trim back the fur as you go to keep it out of your way, but be careful not to cut too deep.\nAgain, make a quick pattern to see how much fabric is needed by laying scrap material over the surface of the mask. Be sure to tuck the material in around all curves your mask might have, so the proper amount of fabric is cut. When in doubt, use more than you think you should, because it's easier to cut extra off than it is to patch areas over. Mark which end of the pattern is the nose/mouth end, and draw an arrow pointing towards the back of the head. This is the direction the grain of the fur should run.\nCut out the fabric and lay it down on the surface of the mask. It should cover the mouth and nose, and chin if you pinch it together. Make sure the fabric is centered and smooth. Begin by gluing down the center of the fabric along the center of the face (the bridge of the nose). Glue all the way up to the edge of the nose you sculpted. Cut a slit in the fabric along the tip of the nose, leaving about half a centimeter or so of overlap for finishing later. This slit should go along the entire length of the nose. Make another slit from the edge of the fabric to the center of the slit you just made (see the 6th picture). These two edges will form the cheeks. Slowly lay and smooth the fabric down around the nose and cheeks, gluing as you go. Glue right up to the edge of the upper lip, but leave the mouth for last.\nSlowly make your way towards the eyes. You should be using a lot of glue to make sure the fabric stays down and does not pucker. If your mask has extreme curves (like the cheekbones mine has), be sure to press down firmly while gluing and give the glue a moment to set. If you end up with a wrinkle, pull the fur around it off and smooth out the fabric again. Don't glue right up to the edges of the mask yet.\nWhen you get to the eyes cut a small slit right in the center, about where the pupil is, in the fabric. Slowly widen and glue down the area around the sculpted eyelids, taking particular care around the \"tear duct.\" Any\u00a0misalignment might result in further reduction of vision.\u00a0\nContinue back from the eyes across the forehead. Smooth out any wrinkles right up to the edge of the mask, where the fur of the hood meets the fur of the face. Trim the edge of the fabric so that it just meets the edge of the hood and glue it down, careful not to get any of the fur tips caught in the glue. Once the glue dries, brush the fur along its grain, across the seam. The result should be a virtually seamless transition between face and hood.\nThe mouth takes a little extra effort. Start out by cutting along the lip line of the top jaw, leaving a bit extra around the edges. Cut slowly and carefully and stop before you hit the elastics. Glue this down and worry about finishing the edges later. Open the mask's mouth as wide as you want it to be able to open and wedge something in there to keep it open. This will assure that while you are gluing down the fabric, you don't leave enough to prevent the mouth from moving. Wrap the fur around and down to the bottom jaw, pulling it out as smoothly as possible. It will probably be necessary to trim down the bottom fabric as well. Glue all along both sides of the jaw, saving the bottom for last. In the end, you should have two flaps which meet below the chin (see picture). Trim off the excess and glue the two tabs down so that their edges meet. If done correctly, this \"seam\" won't be noticeable. Finish all edges by trimming and gluing right up to the edge of the lip.\nThe edges of the mask's mouth might bow out a bit when the mouth is closed, but this can be fixed easily by pinching the fabric inwards and putting a little dot of glue on the inside to hold the pinch. This will create a little wrinkle that will bend towards the inside of the mask when the mouth is closed, rather than the outside.\nYou're almost done now! All that's left are some finishing touches.

All I used is a basic pair of scissors. Unless you really love vacuuming, it should probably be done outside.Trimming Tips:\n- To make a smooth transition from short fur to long (such as from the nose to the forehead), cut in the direction of the grain. Pull little portions of the fur out straight, and angle the scissors to make the cut.\n-To thin the fur out (such as in the ears), pull the fur out straight and cut\u00a0against the grain, keeping the scissors fairly straight. This will result in little portions of the hair to come out, resulting in thinner volume without decreasing the length.\n-Making a smooth, short, flat area (such as the nose) is difficult with the scissors, but doable. First, cut\u00a0perpendicularly\u00a0to the fur, as short as you want it. Multiple cuts next to each other will result in a shorter, yet somewhat ridged surface. Then, cut in the direction of the fur as before to smooth out the ridges.\n-If you want to have spikes or other \"styles\" in the fur, a mixture of hairspray and/or glue can be sprayed on the hair to hold it in place. I used a little glue for the tips of my ears, to keep them pointed\nThere are a few different ways to color the fur, from using dyes to airbrushing paints. I wanted to work with materials I either already had or could obtain cheaply. With some experimentation, I found the best (inexpensive) materials to be either basic\u00a0acrylic\u00a0paints or\u00a0permanent/paint\u00a0markers. You'll need either a fine toothed comb or wire brush to help you out (one that you don't mind getting paint in).\nBefore painting directly on your mask, I suggest experimenting on a scrap piece first.Tips for Coloring the Fur\n-If you decide to use acrylic paints, water them down a little first. This will make them blend easier, and decreases the possibility of the hair clumping together due to the paint. Dab a little of the paint on the area you want to color, close to the base of the fur. Then, brush the paint in, brushing in the direction of the fur.\n-For darker results, work layer by layer- putting a thicker layer of paint on gets messy fast.\n-For permanent marker, dab it on close to the base of the fur and brush it in.\nEven if you aren't putting any markings on your mask, you can use these techniques to make the transition between the eyes, lips, and nose (\"skin\" parts) \u00a0to the rest of the fut more natural. Just use paint the same color as the part, and dab it on both the base of the fur and the edge of the part, brushing the paint in afterwards.\u00a0", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5T/JTG9/H7A8Q5QB/F5TJTG9H7A8Q5QB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIV/6LAL/H7A8Q5QC/FIV6LALH7A8Q5QC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8C/48WI/H7A8Q5QD/F8C48WIH7A8Q5QD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8A/L8J8/H7A8Q5QE/F8AL8J8H7A8Q5QE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHQ/1JP8/H7A8Q5QF/FHQ1JP8H7A8Q5QF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZM/FYF5/H7A8Q5QG/FZMFYF5H7A8Q5QG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVD/F8SB/H7A8Q5QH/FVDF8SBH7A8Q5QH.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 16: Trimming/Coloring the Fur"}, {"step": 17, "steps_text": "All that's left is attaching the ears.

If the smell bothers you, I've heard that spraying in a lacquer can be used to seal in the scent (though I haven't tried it, and I'm not sure if at that point you are swapping the fiberglass smell for a lacquer smell).\nAt some point you will need to swap out the jaw elastics, but it was made so that the elastics are easy to access from the inside.\u00a0\nThank you for taking the time to look at my Instructable, and I hope it can help or inspire you to make your own projects!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FD9/ML03/H7A8Q6LQ/FD9ML03H7A8Q6LQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHF/JLSN/H7A8Q6LS/FHFJLSNH7A8Q6LS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4U/CM0E/H7A8Q6LT/F4UCM0EH7A8Q6LT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLT/XREK/H7A8Q6LV/FLTXREKH7A8Q6LV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 18: ...and You're Done!"}], "channel": "Masks"}, {"category": "costumes", "description": "Here we will be showing you how to create pointy ears on someone.

You can measure body temperature with an IR sensor, GSR and you can connect other devices with changing sinus tone output, for example the Thoughtstream USB. The total cost of this device is about 100\u20ac. It works either as a standalone or you can connect it to Brainbay, an Open Source Neurofeedback software. I developped three designs that allows video or audiofeedback. It simply means you can watch a movie or listen to music. As the temperature drops the movie/ music stops, if it raises the movie/ music plays again.\nAnother feedback option is that of visual feedback in the area of Peripheral Vision. Two LED lights are fixed to the right and left of the head at the fringe of the visual field. In order to perceive the feedback, one switches ones vision into peripheral vision. If the desired values go up, the lights will turn on, if they go down, the lights go off. As staying in peripheral vision is connected to the parasymphathic nerv system, the feedback enhances the level of relaxation. However, this feedback modality needs more testing. I would be happy if the viewer would share knowledge and ideas about peripheral vision with me. This feedback device can also be plugged to your computer serving as feedback modality for neurofeedback.\nFull presentation with downloads: www.draladesign.de/biodevice", "title": "Biofeedback Device Based on Arduino", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Biofeedback-Device-based-on-Arduino-1/", "section": "technology", "steps": [], "channel": "Arduino"}, {"category": "technology", "description": "This instructable is designed to help a science teacher build a sensor that can be used to teach the principles of the vestibular, which is located inside the cochlea.\u00a0 It includes step-by-step instructions on the construction of the sensor as well as information on the principles it can be used to teach. \u00a0This video demonstrates the working sensor:\u00a0http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqqp0mtA83o This sensor's design is based on the Stroke Sensor found at\u00a0http://www.kobakant.at/DIY/?p=792. \u00a0Please visit this site for more examples and information.", "title": "Motion Sensor: Teach Vestibular", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Stroke-Sensor-Teach-Vestibular/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "This following materials will be needed for construction of this sensor: -piece of Easy Felt (this felt is a bigger sheet & also a little stiffer than regular felt) -piece of regular felt -stretch conductive fabric -wonder under (iron on) -iron -neoprene (this need to be ironable and thicker, not the plastic sheet kind) -sewing needle -scissors -Elmer's Glue -conductive thread ($34.95-$39.95) -2 LED lights (any color you choose) (pack of 5 lights of one color, $4.95) -2 sewable coin cell battery holders ($4.95) -2 3V coin cell batteries *Needles, scissors, Elmer's Glue, Wonder Under, and felt can all be purchased at a local craft store such as Hobby Lobby, JoAnn's, Michaels or WalMart *LED lights, battery holders and conductive thread can be purchased from www.sparkfun.com *Coin cell batteries can be purchased anywhere batteries are sold.\u00a0 Radio Shack has a pack of 3 batteries that costs approx $13 *Stretch conductive fabric as well as the thread can be purchased from www.plugandwear.com", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: Materials Needed"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Take your piece of Neoprene and decide the size that you want your sensor to be. \u00a0In this example, the Neoprene piece used was approximately 4x6. \u00a0A rectangle is the best shape to choose.
