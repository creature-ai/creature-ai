Cases that were filed are gradually increasing which makes women feel insecure. Recent statistics says that about one-third of girls under the age of 18 and about one-tenth of children under age of 14 facing harassment problems in their day to day life. As it is difficult to monitor them after their doorstep, we are proposing a system to provide security to women when she feels that she is in panic situation. Our Brain will generate different waves at various situations like Sleeping, day dreaming, Meditation, in Active conversation and during Hypertension. In these situations brainwaves like Delta, Theta, Alpha, Low and High Beta waves are generated.", "title": "Wearable Womens Guard (Intel IOT)", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Wearable-Womens-Guard-Intel-IOT/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Objective of our project is to create a wearable system that converts the feelings expressed by the victim into a tool that saves their life. Major response from body includes increase of heart beat, sweating, muscle contractions and adrenalin secretion. Limited with technologies that determines only the external responses, we design a system that measures muscle contraction, pulse rate and brain waves and with thresholds met alerts are produced to nearby police or neighbours through modules.  Our wearable device which measures pulses and facilitating technologies that takes different muscular activities as their input. But our system comprises use of all three systems through use of biomedical techniques such as electromyography, electroencephalography and pulse sensors. Electromyography (EMG) is a used for evaluating and recording the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles. The rhythm of heartbeat obtained due to artery dilation. Pulse can be used to determine the blood pressure and measured by feeling the arteries of the wrist or neck. Electroencephalography (EEG) is the recording of electrical activity along the scalp. EEG measures voltage fluctuations resulting from ionic current flows within the neurons of the brain.Person has to wear these instruments in an unnoticeable way through which they can be monitored. For example brain wave sensors can be introduced in hair bands and pulse sensors at wearable band that makes them feel comfortable to use. Brain waves are considered as a secondary factor to ensure whether the person is in danger or not.  If it reaches a saturation limit measurement values will be identified by Intel Edison development Board, under such situation current location will be tracked by GSM/GPS device will transmit the panic situation information to their concerned persons (relatives or police station).

Mucus or phlegm are the proper terms when discussing snot.  2. I learned that mucus is a key part to my health.  3. Mucus membranes inside my nose protect me by secreting and stopping germs, pollen, and dust.  4. Mucus and nasal hairs combine as a barrier to protect my lungs.  5. A runny nose can show inflammation and irritation in a body.  6. The color of my mucus can help identify if I am sick.  7. When I have a cold, I secrete up to 60 milliliters of mucus an hour. To my surprise, that equals almost a fourth a can of pop! So in four hours, it would equal one can of pop.  8. Mucus is mostly water and contains proteins, carbohydrates, salt and some cells.  9. Mucus contains a specialized cell type known as a goblet cell. . Most of my mucus drains down my throat without me noticing.  10.Violent nose blowing could cause me to become sicker.  11.

In another bowl, I stirred together two teaspoons of glue gel and three teaspoons of water.I added a few drops of green food dye and stirred. I then poured both mixtures into a baggie. I then sealed and squished the mixtures together. The mixture stayed runny and never became a slime. So I poured the mixture back into the bowl and began adding the glue gel, hoping to have a chemical reaction to form thick slime. I used a whole bottle of gel which consisted of 118 ml and still did not have the expected result. Now I had a problem. The glue gel was too expensive to keep experimenting with to perfect my recipe. So I substituted wood glue for the glue gel and began again. I cut the water down to 236.59 ml and substituted the glue. The mixture was still too runny, so I kept adding glue until it thickened.

Once I had my board finished, I was ready to begin the experiments!  Before each experiment the testing area was prepared using the following steps:  1. I measured a piece of freezer wrap 36 inches long and cut it.  2. From one edge of the freezer wrap I measured and drew a line the length of the paper with a black permanent  sharpie. This would be the line for the placement of the filter in the future experiments.  3. The freezer wrap paper was placed on the testing area first.  4. Then the backboard was placed on the back edge of the freezer wrap.  5. The plunger was removed from the syringe and the syringe was filled with 37 grams of flour. After the syringe  was filled, I replaced the plunger.  6. The solution representing my mucus was prepared using tap water, light corn syrup and unflavored gelatine.  7. Depending on which test, I would applied the correct mucus solution to the testing board  8. The testing board was propped up against the backboard  9. If the test involved the filter, an assistant would stand the filter on the black sharpie line.  10. Then using the syringe I would spray the testing area with the flour.  11. If the test involved the filter, it would gently be removed from the area.  12. Using a metal knife I would collect the flour from the freezer wrap paper.  13. Then I poured the flour back into the syringe and recorded a measurement of how much flour was in the syringe and recorded it.  Then testing was done with the exception of the following steps. Steps 1 and 2 were only done for the first experiment and not repeated. All following experiments began on step 3. Step 6 was not done for the control group. Step 8 was done only with the experiments involving the filter.First Experiment-no mucus with filter  First, I prepared the testing area. The freezer wrap with the measured line was placed on the table. Then the backboard was placed on the freezer wrap paper lining up with the back edge of the freezer wrap paper. The plastic syringe was filled with 37 grams of flour. I applied no snot to the testing board and I stood it up against the backboard. Then my assistant held the filter on the black line which was drawn on the freezer wrap sheet. I sprayed 37 grams of flour to the filter. I then collected the flour from the freezer wrap sheet and measured it. From my measurements, I determined that the filter captured 11 grams of flour and 26 grams of dust was collected from the freezer wrap sheet. Testing area was cleaned for next experiment.Observation: The filter blocked all visible flour! Wow, wasn't expecting it to stop all of it like it did.Second Experiment-no mucus  I prepared the testing area. The freezer wrap with the measured line was placed on the table. Then the backboard was placed on the freezer wrap paper lining up with the back edge of the freezer wrap paper. The plastic syringe was filled with 37 grams of flour. I applied no snot to the testing board and I stood it up against the backboard.I applied no mucus to the testing board and I stood it up against the backboard. The bristles which represented nostril hairs captured some dust. The rest of the dust immediately fell to the freezer wrap sheet. I then collected the flour from the freezer wrap sheet and measured it. From my measurements, I determined that the bristles on my testing board captured 3 grams of flour and 34 grams of dust was collected from the freezer wrap sheet.Observation: I considered this to be an acceptable representation of nostril hairs.Third Experiment-runny mucus with filter  The testing area was prepared and the freezer wrap with the measured line was placed on the table. Then the backboard was placed on the freezer wrap. The dust syringe was prepared with 37 grams of flour. I applied runny mucus to the testing board and then I stood it up against the backboard. Then my assistant held my filter on the black line which was drawn on the freezer wrap sheet. I sprayed 37 grams of flour to the filter. I then collected the flour from the freezer wrap sheet and measured it. From my measurements, I determined that the filter captured 17 grams of flour and 20 grams of dust was collected from the freezer wrap sheet. The testing board was cleaned with water and then dried with a hair drier for the next experiment.Observation: The mucus immediately ran down the testing board with more than half the amount of snot on the sheet.Fourth Experiment-runny snot  The testing area was prepared and the freezer wrap with the measured line was placed on the table. Then the backboard was placed on the freezer wrap sheet. The dust syringe was prepared with 37 grams of flour. I mixed my runny snot solution and applied it to the top area of the testing board and then I stood it up against the backboard. Then dust was applied to the snot. I then collected the flour from the freezer wrap sheet and measured it. From my measurements, I determined that the testing board captured 8 grams of flour and 29 grams of dust was collected from the freezer wrap sheet. Testing area was cleaned for next experiment session.Observation: Once again, most of the mucus immediately ran down the testing board. Since the mucus was runny, it could not capture the dust. From these two experiments, I concluded that there is no way that a runny nose provides much protection for the respiratory system.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 11: Let the Snot Run..."}, {"step": 12, "steps_text": "April 29th, 2014                                                                                                                   Time: 5 hours 20 minutes    12:25 p.m.- 5:15 p.m.     8:30 p.m.- 9:00 p.m. I started the session by re-checking the information from my first group of experiments. After that, I started to brainstorm on ways to pour my slime out of my nose prop during my presentation. I decided to use plastic tubing for a storage area. I injected the slime mixture into my plastic tubing to determine how much tubing I would need to use. I then coiled the tubing and hot glued it together. I also made a stand using popsicle sticks and hot glue. It was made to hold my container of slime which would represent my snot during my presentation. After trial and error, I realized that this would not be feasible to use. So I used a short  piece of a 2\" pvc pipe for a chute. I mounted it on the stand that supported my nose model.

Then I prepared the testing area following the previous procedure listing. I applied  the normal mucus to the testing board and then stood it up against the backboard. My assistant held the filter in front of the testing board. I sprayed 37 grams of flour to the filter. From my measurements, I determined that the filter captured 18 grams of flour and 19 grams of dust was collected from the freezer wrap sheet.

From my measurements, I determined that the testing board captured 25 grams of flour and 12 grams of dust was collected from the freezer wrap sheet.Observation:  I only expected it to capture about half of the flour. The normal mucus laid flat on the testing board without having deep ridges. It was sticky and didn't run down the board, it captured most of the flour out of all my experiments. The mucus held a thin layer of flour all over its surface. Seventh Experiment- Thick mucus with filterI prepared my thick mucus for the experiment and I prepared the testing area.  I applied the thick mucus to the testing board and I stood it up against the backboard. My assistant held the filter in front of my testing board. I sprayed the flour onto the filter. From my measurements, I determined that the filter captured 13 grams of flour and 24 grams of dust was collected from the freezer wrap sheet. Observation:  Once again, the filter blocked the flour and the mucus appeared the same at the end of the experiment compared to how it was when I started the experiment. Eighth Experiment- Thick mucus without filter Testing area was prepared for the next experiment. I prepared my thick mucus for the experiment. I sprayed the flour on the mucus. From my measurements, I determined that the testing board captured 18 grams of flour and 19 grams of dust was collected from the freezer wrap sheet. Observation:  Since the mucus on the testing board had a lot of ridges in it, it held some of the flour in the mucus ridges rather than sticking to the thick mucus. The flour piled onto itself.

A most basic purpose of nose mucus is to protect the respiratory system from foreign objects from entering the respiratory system. Do the different kinds of nose mucus change the filtering capabilities of our nose mucus and what effect does protectant gear have. I hypothesized that different types of mucus\u2019s would capture just as much dust as protectant gear for a nose.To test my hypothesis, I determined that I wanted to use a solution to represent four types of mucus\u2019s and a filter to represent a mask worn over a person\u2019s nose in dusty situations. I established guidelines for all four tests to follow. The filter captured all visible recordable measurements of flour. That led to that set of data that never changed. Each of the four types of mucus\u2019s reacted differently. I concluded from my survey that many people do not understand the importance of mucus. People should use masks or other respiratory gear in any situation where airborne particles are present to help protect the respiratory system by providing another layer of protection.I proved my hypothesis to be wrong. Mucus alone does not protect as well in dusty situations as protectant gear for the nose.IntroductionI hypothesized that different types of mucus\u2019s would capture just as much dust as protectant gear for a nose.While researching a different science project, I came across some basic information concerning the nose and its functions. When it came time to do another project and I began researching various possibilities \u2013 I was still fascinated with the functions of the nose. So I began researching different topics about the nose and its functions.I never realized before how important the mucus in my nose was or what it really did. So I created a survey and distributed to 106 people of various ages. From the answers that were selected, I learned that many people do not understand how important it is to protect their respiratory systems. 52% of the people that were surveyed never use protection in dusty situations. Only 30% of the people used protection sometimes and the smallest group of only 18% protected their noses with protectant gear.I also learned and researched why doctors are always interested in the color of my mucus when I am sick with sinus problems. Various colors present with different possible sicknesses and symptoms so colors can help doctors to identify. With the presentation of my project to various individuals, I hoped to raise awareness about the importance of how their nose mucus works and how extremely important protectant gear is for their respiratory systems. I hope to show them that they cannot depend on their nose mucus to do all the filtering for their bodies in very dusty situations. I want to make people aware that often symptoms such as discoloration in the mucus appear when they do not use protection and it can lead to illness in their respiratory systems.ResultsFirst Experiment-no mucus with filterObservation: The filter blocked all visible flour! Wow, wasn't expecting it to stop all of it like it did.Second Experiment-no mucusObservation: I considered this to be an acceptable representation of nostril hairs.Third Experiment-runny mucus with filterObservation: The mucus immediately ran down the testing board with more than half the amount of snot on the sheet.Fourth Experiment-runny snotObservation: Once again, most of the mucus immediately ran down the testing board. Since the mucus was runny, it could not capture the dust. From these two experiments, I concluded that there is no way that a runny nose provides much protection for the respiratory system.Fifth Experiment-normal mucus with filterObservation: The result was the same as it was with all my other experiments with the filter.Sixth Experiment-normal mucus without filterObservation: I only expected it to capture about half of the flour.

I also determined that people should use masks or other respiratory gear in any situation where airborne particles are present to help the body by providing another layer of protection.I also proved my hypothesis to be wrong. Mucus alone does not protect as well in dusty situations as protectant gear for the nose.In conclusion, mucus plays a big part in the health of our body. Mucus was designed by God to protect our respiratory system from harmful invaders. So just remember, mucus may be gross, but it\u2019s snot a bad thing. ReferencesBone Up on Boogers. (n.d.).

That\u2019s so gross!\u201d This is the most common remark people say concerning snot or what is known as mucus from the nose. Mucus plays a very important roll in the healthy function of our bodies. Its flushing protection is kind of a garbage removal. The color of our snot shows us just what kind of garbage it\u2019s helping remove.Most doctors and scientists agree that the basic purpose of nose mucus is to protect our respiratory system from foreign objects such as bacteria, viruses, grains of dust, pollen and other unwanted invaders from entering our respiratory system. Snot takes these invaders back out our noses or down into our stomachs.Does the kind of nose mucus really make a difference? Does using protectant gear really assist our nose mucus in protecting our bodies? I hypothesized that different types of mucus\u2019s would capture just as much dust as protectant gear for a nose.I prepared a survey before I did my experiments and distributed them to a large variety of people. I wanted to compare my survey results against my test results. I began exploring different ways to prove my hypothesis. I determined that I wanted to test four types of mucus:  runny, normal, thick and no mucus. I also wanted to use a filter to represent a mask that would be worn over a person\u2019s nose in dusty situations. I determined that in my experiments color would not be a factor.I established guidelines for all four tests to follow. Each test involved 2 experiments-one with a filter and one without a filter. Next, I designed a testing area that would be the same for all eight experiments. I set up my experiment area as shown in my photos. I used the same procedures when I collected, measured and recorded the dust that was not captured by the filter or the different kinds of mucus.It was very difficult to find slime recipes that represented the three kinds of mucus. Through trial and error I chose a recipe that consisted of tap water, unflavored gelatin and light corn syrup. In my experiments the mucus would be the only variable that would change.I began my testing with the control group that did not have a mucus solution. I realized two things with my test. In the first experiment the filter blocked all of the flour. In the second experiment the bristles that represented nose hair functioned like the real thing. In each of the following experiments the nose hair followed the same pattern with holding the mucus in place and helping to capture dust.After all my experiments were finished I compared my results and observations. I was surprised to find that the filter captured all recordable measurements of flour. That led to that set of data that never changed. The runny nose was not effective because the mucus was not in the nose long enough to capture any flour. The normal mucus had a layer of flour across all of its surface. Most of the flour in the thick snot was captured in the ridges rather than on its surface.In my research, I learned that clear or slightly yellow mucus indicates a healthy nose. Dr. Harry Malech from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases explains that green mucus receives its coloring from iron found in an enzyme that might indicate a bacterial infection. Rusty colored mucus can be a sign of bleeding from an airway.  And last, mucus that is dark colored can be dust and dirt that was captured in the mucus. Based on my survey questionnaire and the findings from my experiments, I concluded that many people do not understand the importance of mucus. I also determined that people should use masks or other respiratory gear in any situation where airborne particles are present to help the body by providing another layer of protection. I also proved my hypothesis to be wrong. Mucus alone does not protect as well in dusty situations as protectant gear for the nose.In conclusion, mucus plays a big part in the health of our body.

Each fiber of wool has scales along it that catch on the scales of other wool strands causing them to become permanently tangled.  In this tutorial I am using 2 different needles, I'm going to explain why I select and use each of them. The crown point needle is one of my favorites. It has 3 barbs that are right at the tip of the needle. It's triangular in shape, so each barb is placed along one edge of the needle. I prefer doing most of my work with this needle because it only felt a few fiber as a time. It does felt slower than other needles with more barbs but it gives you greater control when shaping a 3d felted piece. The reason that it give you more control is that it essentially felts the inside of a ball of wool while leaving the surface mostly un-felted. This allows you more chances to move or reshape wool than using other needles and it also gives you a firmly felted piece.The star point needle, which in this tutorial is a finer gauged needle has multiple barbs along it's four sided star shaped needle. These extend from the tip up a good distance as you can see in the photo. The barbs are also staggered. This needle felts wool very quickly. This can be a good thing, but it can also cause problems if you want a firmly felted piece in the end. Because it grabs many layers of fiber it tends to felt the surface of a piece while missing the center of piece, which can result in a squish-able animal, or caricature. It's star shape however tends to not leave a noticeable hole in a finished piece which is why I use it for finishing the surface and use the crown point needle for felting the structure. Tips on shaping:When working with wool I basically always start with a ball of wool. Then I Roll it to elongate it into a coil, or flatten it to make a flat piece, or keep rolling it to make a sphere. It's important to remember not to felt one area more than another so always turn a piece and move your needle.Needle direction (or angling) is also important. Your needle is dragging wool in the direction you're stabbing the wool. It's much the same as pushing clay. So keep in mind where you want the fibers to go when you're felting them. If you want them to go in and to the center of a piece then you want you needle straight up and down. If your felting a curve then you want to follow the shape of that curve with your needle. If at any time you get lost, press into the wool with your finger and see how your finger alters the shape. If that's what you want then mimic that push of your finger with your felting needle. Right, so I can't think of anything else to tell you about needle felting, other than it's a very fun and relaxing hobby that I'd suggest everyone try at least once. Hopefully I've covered the important bits.

Then take the roving which is mostly straight and mix the fibers up so that they look like the second photo.

There is really only one step to this process, Roll the wool between your hands then stab your needle into it, over and over again, turning regularly and felting all sides.

To do that you simply felt the sides, pushing gently with your finger to help shape the wool more quickly. Then felt the flat bottom, then felt the top. Try to follow the curve with your needle so that the wool is being pushed towards the center. So by follow the curve I mean that your needle would be straight up and down at the top center, and then as you progress down the right side of the curve your needle end would tip to your right, where as the left side, your needle base (not tip) would tilt towards the left, Again you just repeat the 3 steps above. sides, turning regularly so that the entire area is covered, the flat base, and the top. Remember to keep using your crown point needle, this leaves the surface bubbly looking like in the last photo, but you'll feel the needle resisting as in enters the center of your wool shape. Never force the needle through a piece as that can cause the needle to break, and keep an eye on your fingers. Felting needles tear the skin so it'll be very painful if you stab yourself. Hold the needle gently between your fingers so that if it gets stuck it slips upward as your hand moves down.The sides:Now in the first photo you can see that I'm pushing down with my finger, and angling the needle to my left. the reason for this is that I'm trying to elongate the wool while still shrinking it down and in. If my needle was at a sharper angle I'd be moving the wool even more to the left side. The bottomIn the fourth photo you can see that I'm pushing straight down into the wool. This is the flat bottom side, going straight down and in means that you will just shrink it in the direction your needle is traveling. it's somewhat round, so you're needle will go round a circle, don't forget to get close to the edge on the bottom. You can round the edge up into the body as your shaping the sides of the body, I usually start at the center and felt down until it's mostly flat as it begins pretty rounded, then I felt outward to the edge. Always move your needle to a different spot though, don't just felt in one single location over and over again. The top:Here I'm rounding the top keeping it mostly spherical. In the fifth photo above you can see that I'm angling my needle to match the curve, At the very top my needle would be straight up and down, so as I move to the sides I want to angle the needle, following the curve, which is what you're seeing in the photo. Just to reiterate you felt the sides, rolling it across the sponge as you do,(felting all sides), then you felt the bottom, then the top, and repeat until your wool has shrunk to about 1 1/2 inches and is somewhat firm to the touch when you squeeze it while still springing back out when you stop squeezing it.

If you want to measure you can cut a length of roving 3 1/4 inch long, then split it in half. Then take one of the two strands you have now, and split it in half again. I actually used a bit of scrap wool that I had from another project, but normally I would measure it out like this. I'd keep the other 1/4 of the roving for the belly later on. In the first photo with the dark brown wool I'm demonstrating how you split the roving in half by just pulling it apart from the top down.Or you can guesstimate the amount of wool that you'll need, if you end up with too much you can always cut some of the wool away, or if you end up with too little you can always add a bit more. guessing generally results in something that is unique and one of a kind. For the face I used a pinch of wool fiber I had left over from another project. The second and third photo demonstrate the amount I used. If your guesstimating like I did then use the body piece as a guide, the loose ball of fiber is about half as tall as the body piece. Once I have my fibers rolled in a loose ball I flatten this ball onto the brush. I usually push it down so the brush grabs it then gentle roll it in circles against the palm of my other hand. I couldn't take a photo of this process because it would require I have three hands or a camera that would attach to my tripod. If you don't have a brush just flatten the ball between both hands and gently move them in a circle, it gives you the same flattened sphere at the end. Before removing it you'll want to stab your felting needle into a few times, not too many times, just enough to help the fibers stick together, so you can control them more easily. Take this flattened disc and carefully fold loose fibers from the top edge under just a bit, then lay it down onto the body piece and using your crown point needle felt it together. Stick close to the top as much as you can, you do not want to attach the bottom at all. make a notch at the top by using you needle to just grab the light brown wool and push it down. The sixth photo shows this, my needle is basically flat again the body, only grabbing the  light brown wool. Once you have a dip between the eyes that you are happy with, attach the top part. Make sure that you focus on the edge and then down to about the halfway point. In the photos above you can see I felted one side first and then the other. If you have loose fibers on the edges that you want to tame, use the tip of your needle to push them away from you, then insert the needle along the edge into the body, this makes the needle catch onto the fibers you've pushed away from you and drag them into the body of the felt. I usually tame the edge later on, as you can see in the final photo.Felt until both eyes are done and about half of the face is finished. The last photo has a note that describes the are of the face you want to felt. The body is laid sideways so the top of the body is on the right of the photo. The fibers at the bottom are still loose.

Felt each ball using your crown point needle. Roll it and stab it, every direction. The third photo shows how they look after being felted just a bit with the crown point needle.

Then you attach the arms and legs and felt them together, focusing on the edges where the leg meets the body and then the center of the spherical leg. Use your star needle for this as it will be easier than felting with the crown point into the body.

I ended up having more fiber than I needed, which isn't a problem as you'll see.Once you've flattened you ball of wool into a disc like shape you want to attach it, starting right under the chine, make sure you leave a line of dark brown wool between the belly and the face. Work from the top down towards the bottom, using your needle to move the light brown wool where you want it to be attached. Again pay careful attention to your edged. Once I reached the bottom and could see that I had too much wool I decided to cut it off. Cutting it wasn't absolutely necessary I could have also made the character have a fat belly by doing the same thing I did with the snout (nose) part of the face. I didn't want him to have a really big belly though and I wanted to show you how you can remove excess wool. In the last two photo I swept the tip of the needle from the outside edges in towards the center. I'm using the needle to move the fibers, and the stabbing into the body to secure them. This technique is useful  to master as it give you wonderful control over even the tiniest bits of fiber.Continue felting the belly until it's firmly attached and there are no loose little bits of fiber sticking up on your edges. Also don't forget that you want to felt the dark brown a bit around the belly, if you ignore the dark wool you will find that you have a noticeable dip where one bit of wool meets another, but by felting both at the edges you avoid this happening.

Don't use too little wool, for something like a tail you can remove excess fiber using scissors easier than you can add it. I wanted the tail to be about the length of my thumb nail so I made a coil that was about three times that and about just more than half the width of my nail. If you go back to step 10 you can see the coil in relation to the body. Basically if you want a longer tail make a longer coil if you want a thicker tail add more wool to it.To make the coil or snake.This is exactly the same way you would work clay, start with a ball and then take the finger tips of both hands with the wool between them and drag the finger tips of one hand down towards your palm, rolling the wool between your fingers as you go. Then bring the other hand down the opposite direction. repeat this a few times using gentle pressure.Once you have your coil of wool you want to begin felting it in the middle using your crown point needle. Do NOT felt either edge, leave the fibers at both ends loose. as you can see in the photos this causes it to look u shaped because the fiber in the center is being forced into the coil but the ends aren't worked at all and are still fluffy. Roll this and work the center out to the ends for the length you want the tail to be. Then take the fiber from one end and use your needle to push the fiber away from you and then stab it into the center of your coil. This is a lot like the bottom of the body, just keep dragging your fibers into the center of your coil until you have a somewhat round edge as seen in the fifth photo. Then turn it and work on the sides of the coil again, working down to the very tip while still keeping the bottom fibers free and loose. Again turn the piece regularly and felt from the right (the tip) to the very base, then roll it on your surface and felt  from tip to base again. You want to keep felting When it becomes difficult to work with the crown point needle switch to your star needle. You want to felt the tail really well before attaching it to the body. If you notice the last photo I wanted to demonstrate the point at which the fibers become loose and un-felted, if you take your needle or your finger and push down you will find that it's firm up until you reach the loose fibers at which point the needle can completely compress them down. This photo is meant to demonstrate and remind you that you want to keep the base fibers loose. So focus on the tip and length of the tail more as you are felting the tail. This actually doesn't take very long to make because it is so small. If you are having difficulties holding something tiny and not stabbing into your fingers you can always use another felting needle to hold it in place, or even a pen or something similar. My fingers aren't very big so I find it easy to work small things but most people don't. Just take your time and move slowly when doing a smaller piece.

This will give you mostly equal amounts of wool so that your ears are approximately the same size. Make a sphere by lightly rolling the fibers as you did before and then flatten this sphere into a flat coin shaped piece.Use your brush to felt this into a circle with one edge of fibers still unfelted. You want to insert your needle straight down from the top of the brush. If you look at photo seven you can see that I placed my Ring finger on the needle to mark the depth I could push the needle in with out hitting the bottom of the nail brush. You can use this same method any time you need to pay attention to the depth you are felting fibers.You also want to felt the top and sides of the circles edge. You can turn the brush on it's side as seen in the second to last photo and stab from the edge towards the center.Now you will felt the flat part, felt the edges and then you will flip it over, so what was on the top is now on the bristles of the brush.

You do not need as much wool as you had for the first step of the ears. Roll the fibers into two spheres and then squish them flat. You can felt them a bit before attaching them. Just like you felted the ears before, only focus on felting the center and leaving the edges kind of loose. Now when you attach these peices to the dark brown ears you made in the last step it seems rather tricky. You want to keep your needle at a sharp angle and then like in the last photo, you do not want the barbs of your needle to ever go completely through the dark brown wool. If you push your needle from the top all of the way through the ear you will end up with bits of Light brown wool poking through the other side of the ear. It's very important that you control the depth of your needle while felting this. As I showed you in the last step, you can put your right finger down along the needle at any point. This way when your ring finger makes contact with the felt you don't push further into the piece. If you control your depth with a finger further down the needle you don't have to move slowly or cautiously. Also, keeping the needle angled results in a sturdier felt as your Felting only the surface if it's not strongly felted this part will fall off.

Always use wool batting when creating three-dimensional objects. Use natural colours (white, beige, light brown, brown, grey, dark brown) for the basic shape, then add dyed batting on top to colour the animal.You can use any wool that felts well, whether coarse or fine, but I recommend merino for its tactile softness.Make a bowl of warm soapy water before felting. Dissolve 1 tablespoon of soft soap in one litre (\u00bc gallon) of approximately 50 \u00b0C (122 \u00b0F) water.When felting, it's best to work with your entire hand as much as possible. Felt the basic shape with your flat hand and no pressure at all \u2013 no more than a gentle vibrating over the surface of the wool. The shape of the animal is not hugely important at this stage.Felting is complete when the entire surface is connected evenly together and to the wool below. Once the surface is sufficiently felted, apply gentle pressure to felt into the depths too.Fulling means: rubbing with pressure and rolling between your hands, continuously pushing everything toward the centre. The animal will only take its accurate shape during this final process.", "title": "Felted Mouse in a Resting Position", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Felted-Mouse-in-a-Resting-Position/", "section": "craft", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Materials 8 g (\u00bc oz) in total  Landschaf wool: grey-brownMerino wool: pale pink, white Starting piecesBody: 6 \u00d7 12 cm (2 3/8 x 4\u00be in)Tail: 1 \u00d7 12 cm (3/8 x 4\u00be in)Ears: 2 \u00d7 6 cm (\u00be x 2 3/8 in)", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: You Will Need:"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "a.

We learned early on that moisture is the worst thing for the aids --  if they get too damp because of sweat or splashing water, they'll simply stop working. And then, if you don't have backups, you're out of luck!We like to swim at the beach in the summer, and the YMCA pool in the cooler weather. But what to do with his hearing aids when he wants to go in the water? Just toss them into the bottom of a purse (eek! no way!)? And when he gets sweaty from running around at camp, what do you do if the aids short out? Also, when we travel, my guy needs a place to keep his hearing aids overnight -- a place that will make them dry and fresh for the next day.There are commercial drying kits that cost a lot -- up to a couple hundred dollars! But I figured there had to be a more affordable solution, so here's what I came up with.

But to make it short: For example in Germany there are about 1200 accident victims needing help and there is no reported case in which a first aider got arrested because of doing something wrong.You don't have to do all right (you are no doctor) but you should do something at all. In most cases the forces that have been unleashed while the accidents were much bigger than the forces you can do to the victim.The pictures are all from Wikimedia Commons the authors are mentioned in the particular steps.

In my mind, that encompasses a table saw, a power drill, and small scraps/offcuts.  A belt sander helps, but isn't necessary.My primary offcuts are padauk (the red/orange wood) and spalted padauk (the gnarly/veiny looking wood) , which believe it or not, actually came from a shipping pallet.  I don't even believe it ... so I included a picture of the pallet.  Crazy right?  It was/is probably saturated in chemicals, but it's just so cool looking.  The third arm I've recently grown is actually beneficial, so I'm not even upset.Secondary offcuts were poplar - some light and some that are charcoal in color.  They'll be my test subjects for each action to ensure I don't totally destroy any of the padauk pens.Interesting tidbit:  I only needed to make one pen, but figured I'd make 2-3 in case one didn't survive.  It's also beneficial to make more than one item when filming video, because you can achieve multiple camera angles for individual tasks, which is more interesting to watch in my opinion.

I set the fence to 5/8\" and ripped away until I had a stack of 5/8\" x 5/8\" x various lengths.  Any remaining strips become filler strips, and were in the range of 3/16\" - 1/4\" thick.  For the few that needed to be ripped down, I used dual push sticks and focused attention.  I'd cut halfway through, flip the board on end, and then cut the other half.  Pushing it all the way through the blade would be too precarious and the strip would most likely just fall through the throat plate and cause unnecessary risk.

These spring clamps have some force and while it wasn't much of a problem with the padauk, they will, and did, leave indentations on the softer poplar.Clean up started by trimming the excess filler strip from the ends of the blanks, which I did with a small parts crosscut sled on the table saw.Test fitting the pen cuts into the center chamber revealed that the plastic tips have a flange which press fits into the plastic pen body - think of it like a tenon of sorts.

You could also use a router table with a 45 degree chamfer bit - definitely use push pads for that.  I chose to us the oscillating belt sander because I have a chamfering fixture I made several years ago, which I rarely have the need to use.  It was a variation of a design by Pocket83 on YouTube, which was built around a handheld belt sander.I used the chamfering fixture to sand down the corners and effectively turn the square blanks into octagonal blanks, which looked pretty good as is - add a taper to the tip and they'd make fine pens.  However, my vision was round pens, which meant more work ... aka punishment.I was able to round most of the padauk pens by reaming them onto the 1/8\" steel rod, which I then chucked into the cordless drill and spun against the oscillating belt.  I used a piece of 1/2\" plywood scrap to keep it pressed against the belt.  Just enough pressure for material removal - don't just jam it in there like you're fearfully feeding a hungry hippo.  Once the blank was round and bottomed out on the fixture, I finished sanded with 220 grit.  Just fire up the drill and run a piece of paper along the length by hand.The poplar pens (and a few padauk as well) put up more of a fight and instead of holding tight to the steel rod, they would spin.  The solution was to just chuck the pen blank up in the drill and sand it round with an 80 grit sanding disc, smooth it out with 150 grit, and then finish it with 220 grit.  Since most of the blanks were longer than actually necessary, the chucked portion would get cut off in the near future.  If you can't spare the length, just flip the blank around and be mindful not to over tighten the chuck and mar the wood.About the chamfering fixture:It fits over the existing aluminum deck of the Ridgid OSS and stays in place with a friction fit.  The two vertical posts on each side have a slot running up the middle, in which a T-bolt is able to slide.  This allows the top portion/fence to move up and down, which in turn dictates the width of the chamfer.  Star knobs on the back side pull the fence against the uprights and lock it in place.I don't have plans for the fixture, but it needs to be modified (or rebuilt if I used glue, which I don't remember) because it has two flaws.  I'll film it and make an Instructable when I actually do this.1. The oscillating belt doesn't run truly parallel to the front edge of the deck.  I didn't check that, assumed it did, and built the fixture square to that edge.  Because of this, I end up with deeper/wider chamfers on one end of  my pieces, which can be worked around by flipping your piece, but more noticeable on longer edges.2. I should've made the vertical posts taller so I could have wider chamfers.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FEA/F2R0/IYKFZQ34/FEAF2R0IYKFZQ34.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2P/4QBO/IYLZRT7T/F2P4QBOIYLZRT7T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEX/GNT1/IYLZRT94/FEXGNT1IYLZRT94.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ4/OWTY/IYOQGMVF/FQ4OWTYIYOQGMVF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSU/Z8KA/IYLZRT9G/FSUZ8KAIYLZRT9G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO1/EFGN/IYLZRSMD/FO1EFGNIYLZRSMD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPG/0KXR/IYLZRTCL/FPG0KXRIYLZRTCL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FER/9XRS/IYLZRTB3/FER9XRSIYLZRTB3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN8/564I/IYLZRTEA/FN8564IIYLZRTEA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8Q/W85F/IYLZRTF7/F8QW85FIYLZRTF7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS8/KEZA/IYLZRTFM/FS8KEZAIYLZRTFM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLV/XUYV/IYLZRTG5/FLVXUYVIYLZRTG5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVF/72N9/IYLZRTHK/FVF72N9IYLZRTHK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWC/V6AH/IYOQGNER/FWCV6AHIYOQGNER.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Rounding the Blanks"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "I wanted the wood to taper at the end, so that it transitioned smoothly into the plastic tip.

Epoxy was my adhesive of choice and trying to apply it with a toothpick while holding the nail head in my other hand was a messy nightmare.  The solution to that problem was to tape a piece of tape, adhesive side up, to the worktable.  That had enough grip to hold the nail heads in place while I applied a small amount of epoxy.  Turned out that I didn't even have to pick the nail head up off of the tape.  All I had to do was lower the pen down onto the nail head and they because instant friends.  It was just a matter of making sure it was centered and then leaving it alone while the epoxy cured.  Once cured, I did quickly sand the ends using the oscillating belt sander to remove any epoxy blobs and sightly round over the back edge.You can see in the last picture that I made a quick track to hold the pens while the epoxy cured.

Around a year ago I found myself not too happy with the stock ear pads of my earmuffs (my main set are some 3M Peltor Sport Tactical 100 Electronic Hearing Protection - around 50$). After looking around, I found that the upgrade replacement pads are the 3M Peltor Camelback Gel Sealing Rings HY80, which costs about 50$. I was definitely not happy about paying as much for gel pads as I was paying for the earmuffs, but oh well, I took a leap and I was happy with it for about a year. Extremely comfortable for long periods of time and not any warmer.Then I decided to look for some upgraded gel pads for my backup set of earmuffs, the 3M Peltor Sport RangeGuard Electronic Hearing Protector RG-OTH-4. Since they were simply a backup for me or a loaner for others, I was definitely not going to spend 50$ again. That's when I came across this: Silicone Gel Ear Seal Replacement for Pilot Aviation Headset. At around 15$ if it worked it would be a must have upgrade!And work it did. Since then I decided to get rid of my 3M Camelback Gel Pads and just use the aviation gel seals on both. As this is my second install, and I thought others might appreciate me documenting the process.I've updated this project over time.

I'll give my opinion here in case anyone's on the fence. If all you want to know is how to complete the project, feel free to jump straight to the next step.Which Hearing ProtectorsIn my case, music was a must have, and electronic hearing protection might as well be. I also wanted them to be collapsible, too. The 3M Peltor line of hearing protection seemed to be the best balance between price and function for me.By the way, I also tried the Howard Leight 1030110 Sync Noise-Blocking Stereo Earmuff for a few months, and those are garbage both audio and comfort wise (in my opinion), so I'd recommend skipping those.Which EarpadsSo far I've tried the stock foam pads, the OEM 3M Peltor Camelback Gel Sealing Rings, and generic aviation gel pads. In all honesty, I think for the price you just can't beat the generic aviation gel pads. But your case or needs may be different. My thoughts are:OEM Foam Pads- The original pads are fine for short periods of time, but I don't have much more positive to say about them. They aren't comfortable at all for long periods, and they do get sweaty in hot weather. They're pretty thin too, which can be an issue if you are wearing earphones underneath. For the price (essentially free) they're fine, but I wouldn't find any reason to go back to them once you've tried gel. Note: I don't think they are any more uncomfortable than any other original earmuff pads, and if anything better than average.3M Peltor Camelback Gel Sealing Rings- These are great, no denying that. If your job requires hearing protection just buy these and call it a day. They aren't supposed to fit the Peltor hearing protectors I listed above, but in my experience they worked. YMMV. They were a bit hard to put on but not impossible. I do find the lip in the middle of the pad a bit annoying to keep clean, but I suppose they seal off sound a bit better thanks to it. They are thinner than the aviation gel pads, which can be either good or bad. About half as thick, and just slightly larger than the original pads. If you occasionally wear earphones under the earmuffs, that might be bad. If you intend to use them shooting a rifle with your cheek against the stock, it's probably desirable.But the real deal-breaker is the price. It doesn't make sense to me to spend as much on the ear pads as you do on the earmuffs. Especially when they are technically a consumable. Whether it's worth it or not is your call.Aviation Gel Seals - Designed for aviation headsets, they seem to all be pretty much the same inside this price category. As in if the pictures look identical, they're probably the same exact product regardless of the brand. I purchased two sets from 2 different brands for about 15$ and as far as I can tell they were exactly the same. Expect them to arrive in a zip-lock bag with no other packaging. They are just as comfortable if not more than the 3M Peltor Camelback rings, and since they're about double as thick it's a lot more cushioning, allows more space for headsets or earphones underneath, and I dare say more comfortable in the heat thanks to the added air gap. Since they are designed for pilots they are probably as good if not better at sealing off sound compared to foam pads (think your compressor is noisy? Try the cabin of a Cessna). I don't think using these would compromise safety at all, and could probably help. Like mentioned in the previous point, it being double as thick may or may not be good for your situation. In the shop? Irrelevant. Shooting your AR or bolt action? Not ideal, but probably irrelevant. Your call.All in all, I think for 15-20$ they are the best choice by defect.Well, now that that has been sorted out, let's go on to the next step.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FB3/PDRL/J3YPPPKL/FB3PDRLJ3YPPPKL.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Notes on Gear"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "What you'll need is as follows:Hearing protectors- The mounting plate will vary depending on the model.

With double sided tape if it comes unstuck at an edge it will stick again at least helping to keep other parts from coming unstuck. Plus it allows for more surface being adhered and an airtight seal between the gel pad and the mounting ring.Smaller sections of a roll of double sided tape is an option, but not ideal since there will be air gaps.

Apply the adhesive.Since this is a thermal adhesive, do it as quick as possible. You want to make a complete ring so it seals the air in or out. You don't want it thick, just apply a bit and spread it.As far as mounting position, the mounting ring doesn't have an orientation but the Gel Seal does. You want to mount the Gel Seal with the tiny vent hole at its bottom facing down. The hole is simply there to let air escape when the rings are compressed.

We describe the tracks as veins (blood going to heart) and arteries (blood going away). A way I help students remember is that the heart thinks it's the most important organ in the body, so everything going to it is a \"vein\" because it's \"vain.\" To feel our pulse, check one of the easy arteries and hold for 30 seconds.

Often in the front, you'll simply find two tubes without flaps which are the pulmonary veins and arteries. First, blood comes in from the vena cava on the right ventricle, then gets pumped out the pulmonary artery. After getting oxygen, it returns through the pulmonary vein, and then back out to the body.

I wanted people to know a little about congenital heart defects.  According to the March of Dimes, congenital heart defects are the #1 birth defect, and over 25,000 babies are born each year with heart defects in the United States alone. Hypoplastic right heart syndrome a rare and severe type of congenital heart defect; its causes are unknown.  HRHS refers to underdeveloped right side structures of the heart.  The right side of the heart, which is supposed to pump blood to the lungs, is too small to function; in practical terms, babies with HRHS have only half of a functioning heart. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome or HLHS, while still rare, is more common than HRHS.  The treatments are almost the same. Every heart defect is pretty unique with its own set of complications.  This instructable will give a general idea of the process commonly used to treat a heart with only one usable ventricle.**update** I was asked to put a link here. Our family is struggling now; step 8 has more information about that. If you're interested in helping, please consider sharing this: Faul Family Recovery.

Veins are blood vessels that carry blood to the heart, and the vena cava is a very large vein that the other veins from the body connect to; it has an upper and a lower portion, called superior vena cava and inferior vena cava, respectively. \u00a0 Veins have one way valves that prevent the blood from backing up and pooling. \u00a0Blood is pushed through veins by more blood behind it, and also partially by muscles squishing veins during normal human movement. In a healthy mature heart, blood enters a chamber called the right atrium from the vena cava. \u00a0The atrium contracts to squish blood through a valve into the right ventricle. \u00a0The valve keeps blood from flowing back from the ventricle into the atrium. \u00a0The atrium is smaller than the ventricle because it doesn't need to pump the blood as far, so it doesn't need as much muscle tissue to move the blood forcefully. \u00a0If you threw a ball ten feet, you wouldn't have to use as much force as if you threw it fifty feet. The right ventricle pumps the blood through the pulmonary artery to the lungs. \u00a0Pulmonary \u00a0means \"of or pertaining to the lungs\" \u00a0and an artery is a vessel that carries blood away from the heart, so pulmonary artery means \"blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs.\" \u00a0Once in the lungs, the blood picks up oxygen and drops off carbon dioxide. \u00a0All of our cells need oxygen in order to survive and produce carbon dioxide as a waste product. The newly oxygenated blood returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins. \u00a0If we remember what pulmonary means and what vein means, we know that pulmonary veins are blood vessels that carry blood to the lungs to the heart. \u00a0The blood enters the left atrium, which contracts to squish it through a valve into the left ventricle. \u00a0The left ventricle then contracts to pump the blood through the aorta. \u00a0The aorta is the huge artery that carries oxygenated blood away from the heart to the body. \u00a0It branches into lots of arteries, which get smaller and smaller until they end in tiny capillaries. \u00a0Capillaries are tiny little blood vessels. \u00a0The blood carries oxygen to the cells, picks up carbon dioxide, then flows back to the heart through veins.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FBS/VHV6/GELSMNHE/FBSVHV6GELSMNHE.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: How the Heart Works"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "This is one of the many reasons it's important to get good prenatal care. \u00a0The ultrasound tech and supervising doctor have many things they look for at the routine 20 week ultrasound. \u00a0One of those things is the heart. \u00a0They check for all four chambers, watch it beat, note the size and function, time the heartbeats, check the blood movement through the heart, and many other things I'd know if I'd actually gone to med school. Sometimes they can't get a very detailed view of the heart and the obstetrician will send a pregnant woman to a high risk pregnancy specialist, who has lots of experience looking at ultrasounds up close and detecting potential issues with the fetus. \u00a0Often, the specialist will see that there's nothing wrong with the baby's heart. \u00a0Sometimes, the specialist will see a heart defect. \u00a0If that's the case, the pregnant woman will likely be sent to a pediatric cardiologist for what's called a fetal echocardiogram. \u00a0From a pregnant woman's perspective, this is just like an ultrasound, except that she has to lie still for longer while the ultrasound tech and pediatric cardiologist get a really close look at the fetus' heart. \u00a0If the woman happens to be heavily pregnant with twins, she'll very likely be unable to lie on her back without passing out. \u00a0She'll have to lie on her side, which will be excruciating if she also has really loose and sore ligaments in her pelvis due to pregnancy, causing her hips to actually pop out of joint sometimes. \u00a0It's okay to cry in the ultrasound room for whatever reason. It can be tough to find out about a serious heart defect in your unborn baby and go from telling people, \"we're expecting!\" to \"well, our baby has a 75% chance of surviving the three open heart surgeries she'll have by age three if no other complications arise.\" \u00a0Early detection is medically important, though. \u00a0While in the womb, a fetus has its blood oxygenated by the mother. \u00a0After birth, an infant's heart has to pump blood to the lungs to get oxygenated and then pump the oxygenated blood to the body. \u00a0A heart with a hypoplastic ventricle can start to fail as soon as the baby is born. \u00a0The baby will have the best chance if a medical team is ready for intervention from the start. \u00a0Hypoplastic heart babies usually have their first open heart surgery within days of birth. While a three phase surgical intervention is the most common treatment for a hypoplastic heart, some parents sometimes choose other options. \u00a0One is a heart transplant. \u00a0Newborn donor hearts are in short supply. \u00a0Heart transplants usually don't last more than 15 years in a patient before the patient needs a new heart. \u00a0The patient will often have to be on heavy doses of medications to suppress his or her immune system for life (to keep from rejecting the heart), which can obviously lead to other risks like infection and lymphatic cancer. \u00a0Some parents choose to terminate the pregnancy. \u00a0Some parents choose something called \"compassionate care.\" \u00a0Compassionate care, in this case, involves taking the baby home, feeding, holding, and loving the baby without surgical interventions, and allowing the baby to die a natural death in the arms of loved ones. \u00a0This instructable won't cover the other options because they're not what we went with. \u00a0Keep in mind that nobody can tell a parent what the best option is; every situation is different, and parents need to choose what's right for their family.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F7K/OO6H/GELSMMNH/F7KOO6HGELSMMNH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEY/BXOV/GELSMNHJ/FEYBXOVGELSMNHJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDC/WKJC/GELSMNHG/FDCWKJCGELSMNHG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGW/QD37/GELSMNLH/FGWQD37GELSMNLH.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Early Diagnosis"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Healthy newborn hearts have two extra openings that close over time. \u00a0The foramen ovule is an opening that connects the right and left atrium. \u00a0The ductus is an opening that connects the aorta and the pulmonary artery. These openings allow oxygenated blood to mix with deoxygenated blood. \u00a0This isn't optimal for people with healthy hearts, but it will keep babies alive if their heart can't otherwise get blood to the lungs or to the body. \u00a0A modified Blalock-Taussig Shut made of Gore-tex is often used to keep an open connection between the aorta and the pulmonary artery. \u00a0This allows some of the blood to leave the heart and go to the lungs to pick up oxygen, since the normal route won't work. Depending on the specific defect, other corrections might also be done during the first surgery. Note that in the picture I drew, the right ventricle is underdeveloped, and the pulmonary artery leading away from it is very tiny. \u00a0Without surgical intervention, the blood wouldn't be able to move once it entered the heart from the vena cava. \u00a0After the shunt is installed and the opening between the left and right atrium is widened if necessary, the blood flow is as follows: The deoxygenated blood from the body enters the joined atria in the heart through the vena cava, where it mixes with oxygenated blood entering the joined atria from the pulmonary veins. \u00a0The mixed blood gets pumped into the left ventricle, and exits through the aorta. \u00a0Some of the blood exiting the aorta will flow through the shunt and go to the lungs to pick up oxygen, while some of the blood will be pumped to the body. \u00a0The baby's body gets mixed blood instead of fully oxygenated blood, which isn't as efficient as a healthy baby, but it keeps the baby alive until he or she is old enough for the next step. After the first surgery, it's important for the baby to get lots of calories. \u00a0The inefficient heart has to work extra hard, which burns a lot of calories. \u00a0The larger the baby grows, the better the odds of successfully getting through the next surgery. \u00a0As the baby grows larger, though, the heart will have more and more trouble keeping up. \u00a0The baby might be put on oxygen. \u00a0His or her lips, toes, and fingertips might look a bit dusky bluish. \u00a0Doctors keep a very close eye on the baby during this time. \u00a0If the oxygen saturation is too high, the body might grow more blood vessels around less vital areas like the digestive system, which can leave the more vital areas like the heart, lungs, and brain with less oxygenated blood. \u00a0If the oxygen saturation is too low, the body often compensates by growing lots of extra little blood vessels. \u00a0This can make the next surgery dangerous because it will greatly increase bleeding when the surgeon cuts things open.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFS/9S6T/GELSMMND/FFS9S6TGELSMMND.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDC/WKJC/GELSMNHG/FDCWKJCGELSMNHG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEY/BXOV/GELSMNHJ/FEYBXOVGELSMNHJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN8/ID93/GELSMNHF/FN8ID93GELSMNHF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDB/8BOH/GELSMMNE/FDB8BOHGELSMMNE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIR/975S/GELSMMNB/FIR975SGELSMMNB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAT/JJU5/GELSMMNA/FATJJU5GELSMMNA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGR/Q21V/GELSMMN9/FGRQ21VGELSMMN9.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Blalock-Taussig Shunt"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "The Glenn procedure is usually performed when the baby is a few months old. \u00a0Originally, the Glenn and Fontan procedures were done all together, but it was discovered that babies fare better if they're split into separate surgeries with a fair amount of time in between. The shunt is removed and the superior vena cava is connected to the pulmonary artery. After this surgery, the blood flow is as follows: Blood returning from the upper half of the body flows through the superior vena cava into the pulmonary artery. \u00a0The blood relies on the pressure of more blood behind it to move into the lungs, since right ventricle can't. \u00a0The blood gets oxygenated in the lungs and enters the joined atrial chambers in the heart through the pulmonary veins. \u00a0The deoxygenated blood returning from the lower half of the body also enters the joined atrial chambers of the heart and mixes with the oxygenated blood. \u00a0The mixed blood is then pumped out through the aorta to the body. Children tend to have a higher rate of survival from this surgery. \u00a0It's still open heart surgery and carries lots of risks, but it's less invasive and delicate than the first surgery. \u00a0Their oxygen saturation levels usually improve after the Glenn procedure, although they'll still be lower than the oxygen levels of children with healthy hearts. \u00a0Babies with lower oxygen levels can often feel nauseated and have less energy. \u00a0A heart baby might hit developmental milestones at later times and have trouble with eating and reflux. \u00a0This becomes more likely and more pronounced the longer the baby spends at the hospital recovering from surgical interventions and other possible complications.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F50/IBMM/GELSMMN6/F50IBMMGELSMMN6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6Z/DOSE/GELSMNHH/F6ZDOSEGELSMNHH.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Glenn Shunt"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "The Fontan is usually performed between age 2 and 3, depending on how big the child is, how blue he or she is (yes, really), and other factors.

After a lot of pondering and discussion with her medical team at Primary Children's Medical Center, we determined that she likely wouldn't survive a heart transplant, the only treatment option for her heart failure.We brought her home on hospice care. The doctors estimated that she only had a few months to live.Things were very rough at first. I won't give details here, but she was very sick.Abigail is still alive. She and her twin sister, Lilith, will turn 6 at the end of February of this year (2015). She's still on hospice care and still has heart failure, but she's been with us for far longer than the doctors had anticipated. We're so grateful for every day with our sweet girl. She still doesn't sit up on her own; low oxygen and blood flow leaves her muscles weak, and her sensory aversions have greatly hampered her physical therapy. She attends special kindergarten and adores her classmates, aides, and therapists.Caregiving can take its toll. Josh, who has been a web developer for many years, recently became completely unable to work because of his crippling anxiety and depression. Even the idea of updating his (currently blank) website triggers panic attacks now. He's getting therapy, but it will likely take months for him to be able to heal enough to think clearly (and work again). I've seen a lot of articles on \"preventing caregiver burnout\" that talk about taking breaks, getting others to help out, etc. That's great for people who even have those options... but all our extra income went to medical bills. Josh made \"too much money\" for us to qualify for financial assistance. Insurance doesn't cover everything, and out of pocket max amounts are thousands of dollars per year. Three autistic children take a whole lot of energy and time, and I don't get breaks. My kids have panic attacks when I leave them. Josh's anxiety prevents him from being able to go elsewhere to \"wind down\" when he needs it. Now that we have no resources and no source of income, I'm at a complete loss. I've filed applications for government programs that might provide meager assistance, but haven't heard back yet.

The proliferation and popularity of Open source hardware and software, like the Arduino and Raspberry PI,  have made it possible for makers to build all kinds of  Gadgets. The by- product market of peripherals, like sensors, displays, and communication modules  for these microcontrollers has also skyrocketed. You can now build devices to sense virtually any physical phenomena and display the results either locally on a attached display, or remotely via a Bluetooth or Wi-Fi module to a pc or smartphone. This instructable is a good example of how easy it is now to build a practical tool that can help improve your life by monitoring your heart. I hope it inspirers both beginning and experienced makers to keep on building.According to Wikipedia the definition of  EKG is:\"Electrocardiography (ECG or EKG *) is the process of recording the electrical activity of the heart over a period of time using electrodes placed on a patient's body. These electrodes detect the tiny electrical changes on the skin that arise from the heart muscle depolarizing during each heartbeat.\"In this instructable, I will show you how to build a portable EKG, that fits the above description, using COTS (Common  Of The Shelf) parts.But before we start the build, and because this is a device that you attach to your body:DISCLAMER: This project is not intended to be used as a medical device, it was conceived for educational purposes, use of this device for  purposes other than those intended,  is at your own risk.That said, practical uses of this monitor are biofeedback - meditation aid,  lie detector   heart rate monitor , etc...The main purpose of this instructable is to show you how you can use the Arduino to monitor your heart rate, and learn  a little about  how  modern medicine can diagnose heart related health issues.Most of the projects I make are for my own edification, but I also love to share my findings with others and hope that some of you enjoy learning by making as much as I do.

You just have to put the parts together. The heart (no pun intended!) of the project is the OLIMEX EKG Shield. This shield is the most expensive part of the project, but in my opinion, totally worth it's cost.Once you have your parts in hand, just align the male pins on the OLIMEX shield with the female sockets on the Arduino and push with enough pressure to allow the pins to slide into the Arduino sockets. Do the same with the TFT LCD Shield and stack it on top of the OLIMEX Shield.  You Are done with the Build..!! HARDWARE DESCRIPTIONSBefore we go to the Software configuration, I want to briefly describe the hardware components, how they interact and what resources they use to perform the functions we desire.- for those who are interested. If not, feel free to go and configure the software in the next step. Below are summary descriptions  of the three boards used, summarized from information found in the internet.THE ARDUINO UNOThe first component is the Arduino Micro controller. I like to think of the Arduino as a set of pins that I can control and configure (through software instructions) to do my bidding. The pins are divided into three categories: Digital pins, Analog pins, and Support pins.The Digital pins:Each of the 14 digital pins on the Arduino Uno can be used as an input or output, using pinMode(),digitalWrite(), and digitalRead() functions. They operate at 5 volts. Each pin can provide or receive a maximum of 40 mA and have an internal pull-up resistor (disconnected by default) of 20-50 KOhms.  In addition, some pins have specialized functions:Serial: pins 0 (RX) and 1 (TX) are used to receive (RX) and transmit (TX) TTL serial data. These pins are also connected to the corresponding pins of the ATmega8U2 USB-to-TTL Serial chip( if you use these pins to interface with a sensor or output device, you will need to disconnect the device before downloading a program or it will probably interfere with the download). External Interrupts: pins 2 and 3. These pins can also be configured to trigger an interrupt on a low value, a leading or falling edge, or a change in value. See the attachInterrupt() function for details. PWM pins: 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11. can also Provide 8-bit PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) output with the analogWrite() function (usually used to control motor speed). SPI: 10 (SS), 11 (MOSI), 12 (MISO), 13 (SCK). These pins support SPI communication using the SPI library. LED: 13. There is a built-in LED connected to digital pin 13. When the pin is HIGH value, the LED is on, when the pin is LOW, it\u2019s off.The analog pins The Uno has 6 analog inputs, labeled A0 through A5, each of which can provide 10 bits of  analog to digital conversion resolution (i.e. 1024 different values). By default they measure from ground to 5 volts, though it is possible to change the upper end of the range using the AREF pin and the analogReference() function.in addition, some of the Analog pins also have specialized functionality: TWI(Two Wire Interface): A4 or SDA pin and A5 or SCL pin. Support TWI communication using the Wire library. (Note: you can also use the analog pins as digital pins)There are a couple of other Support pins on the board: Reset; Bring this line LOW to reset the microcontroller. Typically used to add a reset button to shields which block the one on the board.. Last but not least are the Power pins that can provide Ground and 5 volt as well as 3.3 volt power to your project.OLIMEX SHIELD-EKG-EMGThe Olimex EKG Shield is basically an instrumentation amplifier followed by an operational amplifier and a low pass filter. The shield has pass through pin sockets so you can piggy back another shield on top of it. the output is  jumper configurable to any of the Arduino analog pins (A0 to A5). Below is a summarized but  more detailed explanation from the Olimex web site:The EKG/EMG shield allows the  Arduino to  capture Electrocardiography and /or Electromyography signals. The shield opens new possibilities to experiment with biofeedback. With this shield, you can monitor your heartbeat,  log your pulse, and /or recognize gestures by monitoring and analyzing muscle activity. The EKG-EMG SHIELD converts an analog differential signal (the ECG/EMG bio potentials generated by muscles), attached to its CH1_IN+/CH1_IN- inputs, into a single stream of amplified and filtered analog signal at the output. Since the output signal is analog, it has to be fed to one of the five Arduino analog inputs to be discretized (analog to digital conversion) further with aim to give the option of digital processing. Typically, this is done via dedicated ADC embedded in the MCU of the base board (like: OLIMEXINO-328, OLIMEXINO-32U4, OLIMEXINO-STM32, etc). In the demo example we have provided, \"ShieldEkgEmgDemo.ino\", we have used 10-bit ADC with 256Hz sampling rate. SHIELD-EKG-EMG\u2019s total gain is the product of the gains of each  stage: Instrumental Amplifier(G1=10), OPamp with adjustable gain (G2=6..101) and 3rd order \"Butterworth\" filter (G3=3.56). Then, the Gtotal = G1*G2*G3 = 10*(6..101)*3.56. By default,  the G2 gain is set to approximately 80. So, Gtotal = 10*(~80)*3.56 ~ 2848. Vmaxanalog = 3.0V/2848 ~ 1mV Note that the 3rd order \"Butterworth\" filter's cutoff frequency is set to fc = 40Hz.UNO R3 2.8 TFT Touch ScreenDescription:   2.8\" TFT LCD Display is an LCD touch screen module. It has a  40 pin interface and SD card / Flash reader built in.  It is a powerful, multifunctional module .The Screen includes a  ILI9325 controller, that supports 8/16bit data interfacing ,it is  easy to drive by micro controllers like Arduino, STM32 ,AVR and 8051. It contains an integrated  touch controller. The touch IC is XPT2046 , and touch interface pins are included in the 40 pin breakout. Features:       \u2022240374PQ      \u2022262K color     \u2022240*320     \u20222.8 inch     \u2022Wide viewing angle     \u2022ILI9325:240 RGB x 320 TFT Driver     \u2022Integrated Power, Gate and Source Driver With RAM     \u2022XPT2046-WIRE TOUCH,WIRE TOUCH, UP TO 125kHz CONVERSION RATE, SERIAL INTERFACE     \u2022Voltage type: 5v or 3v voltage input voltage, input is selectable. but Because TFT can only work under 3.3 Volts  when the input voltage VIN is 5 Volts, it  needs to be converted to  3.3 Volts  by the onboard voltage regulator IC that  steps down the 5V to 3.3V. When the input voltage is  3.3 Volts, you need to use a jumper to short J2 , to bypass the voltage regulator IC and power the screen directly     Note: the factory default for the TFT module is 5 Volts power supply.  The on board SD holder is set to work on SPI mode.Component interaction and resources.Now that we are familiar with the  basic parts, lets describe how they interact with each other :The OLIMEX shield uses only one  Arduino resource, the Analog 5 input (A5).The amplified and filtered  signal from your heart is fed to this input to be digitized by the Arduino Analog to digital converter. You can select what  Arduino analog input you want to feed the signal to with a jumper, but the analog 5  (A5) is the only input not used by the TFT LCD display.The TFT Touch screen display uses  digital pins (D2 to D13) plus the analog pins (A0 to A4) to manage  the display output, the touch screen functions, and the SD card. this leaves only 3  free I/O pins on the Arduino; the  A5  analog input (which we will use to feed the signal that comes from the OLIMEX shield) and the TX (D1) and RX(D0) digital I/O pins that are used for communication.As you can see, all the pins in our Arduino are used up!!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F0J/7OT7/J3OPR4B5/F0J7OT7J3OPR4B5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBA/FAD6/J3OPR4CX/FBAFAD6J3OPR4CX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3M/RHZ9/J3OPR4II/F3MRHZ9J3OPR4II.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2N/HNTS/J3OPR4OR/F2NHNTSJ3OPR4OR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKH/PP46/J3OPR3Z0/FKHPP46J3OPR3Z0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPY/4TW1/J3OPR44U/FPY4TW1J3OPR44U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDX/2L45/J5CQ87Q4/FDX2L45J5CQ87Q4.LARGE.jpg", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png"], "step_title": "Step 1: Parts Needed /Construction"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Before you can run the sketch, you need to make sure you have the required libraries installed.

However, you should be aware of the limitations of EL wire when you plan your design.  \rThe center core of EL wire is made of solid copper, and like any solid wire it will break due to fatigue damage after repeated bending.  On the human body, the elbows, knees, shoulders, and hips undergo the most movement.  You can make the electronics last longer by mounting EL on areas that don't flex as much, and using stranded insulated connector wire (which can flex) to join the glowing pieces together inside the garment.\rPlan the placement of EL wire with temporary markers like pieces of string, pins, or stickers, or make a sketch on a digital photo of the garment.  You can follow the seams, or add axtra lines as desired.   Decide which sections can be lit up with a single continuous piece of EL wire, and which will require multiple pieces.  \rThen, decide what path the wire will take for each section, and mark the entry and exit points. To make sharp \"T\" shaped junctions, you may need to run the wire inside the jacket at some locations.

If you are not experienced with soldering EL wire, order extra so you can practice.  You may need to cut and re-strip the ends multiple times.\rThere are many sources for buying EL wire online, such as coolneon.com and worldaglow.com\rThicknesses:\rthin (angel hair)\rnormal thickness (2.3 mm diameter)\rextra thick/phat (3.2mm or 5mm diameter)\rI prefer normal thickness, high brightness wire for most applications.  The thin wire can be bent into finer shapes, but it is more fragile (better suited for a hat or a tiara, for example).  The thick wire is more durable, being protected by a thicker outer plastic core, but it cannot be bent as tightly and may not be suitable for designs with fine details or sharp bends.\rColors:\rThere are two standard phosphor colors for EL wire:  aqua blue (which is white with a clear sheath when off), and white (which is pink when off, due to the addition of a red phosphor in the mix).  The other colors (pink, red, orange, yellow, lime green, dark green, dark blue, and violet) are achieved by filtering the aqua light through a tinted outer sheath.  Aqua tends to be the brightest, although the brightness can be adjusted when you select your driver.\rEL Drivers:\rEL wire uses a high voltage and high frequency alternating current to activate the phosphor.  An EL driver, also known as an inverter, is required to convert your low voltage DC power from the battery into a high voltage AC source.  The length rating of the EL driver should be matched to the total length of glowing wire that you want to illuminate, regardless of whether it is wired in series or in parallel.\rSome drivers will produce a steady glow in your EL wire, others have built-in options for blinking and sound reactivity.

If you'd like more detail, you can get directions from the places that sell EL wire, or see this instructable:https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Solder-EL-Electroluminescent-Wire/For each piece of EL wire in your design, cut the proper length (with at least a few extra inches at each end), and solder the end of each piece to a connector, or to a double-conductor piece of ribbon cable that is long enough to reach the driver.  The polarity does not matter - either wire can be connected to the center core or the outer wires.  There are many methods for soldering EL wire, for any of these you should end up with a reinforced region with heat shrink tubing covering the junction.I strongly recommend that you test the wire at this stage, joining the two conductors to an inverter,  before it is attached to the garment.  This is also a good time to join the pieces together to test the overall brightness, and decide whether you'd like to use a stronger inverter.  You can achieve a higher level of brightness by overdriving the wire (e.g., attaching a short length of wire to one that is designed for a longer piece).  It will burn out the phosphor on the wire faster, but that might not be important for some applications.  Under normal usage, EL wire should have 3000 to 5000 hours of glowing life before the phosphor fades to 1/2 of its normal brightness.

Look for the basic clear kind, in one of the lower weights. I typically use the 6lb type, but 4lb and 8lb will also work reasonably well.  You can also use standard thread, if you don't mind that it will block light from the EL wherever you make a stitch.\rMake a hole in the fabric where you want to have an entry point.  with the connector wires on the inside, pull the EL wire through the hole.  When you get to the solder junction and shrink tubing, leave that part inside the garment and position it in a way that can be reinforced.  For example, you may want to sew it to the inside of a seam, or add glue.  It is most important that the area inside the shrink tubing is not going to bend repeatedly - this is the most fragile part of the wire.\rIf you are doing the type of installation where you are running one long piece along an arm or leg, or another line that is going to extend when you flex, then it is better to mount the EL wire in a way that allows the end to slide slightly in and out of the hole.\rTo sew the wire in place:  use a needle that is appropriate for the garment fabric (leather needles have a special piercing point at the end).  Thread the needle.  As a rule of thumb, a good amount of thread to use is the distance between your hands when your arms are spread out.  Shorter pieces will require frequent re-threading, longer pieces tend to get tangled and caught on things.  I like to sew with a double strand of thread - meaning the needle is positioned at the halfway point on the piece of fishing line, and the two ends are tied together.  A double knot is a good idea.\rWhen you start sewing, run the needle between the two threads after the first stitch, to make a better anchor to the knot.  This ensures the the knot will not pull through the hole in the fabric.\rSew along the length of the EL wire with a diagonal whip stitch, using whatvever spacing is needed to hold the wire in the proper shape.  If the fabric is especially thick or difficult to sew through, you can use a line of topstitching as your anchor.  \rTie an extra knot in the fishing line periodically (every 5-6 inches), so that if part of it breaks it will not undo the rest of the stitching.\rFor some materials, a strong flexible glue may be a better choice.  For example, EL wire can be mounted to a plastic surface (such as a helmet) by hot glue, E6000, or 3M Super Strength Adhesive.\rAnother method for attaching EL wire to clothing is to make a casing or channel with sheer fabric, and slide the wire through there.  \rOr, if you're looking for an extremely easy short cut, or a quick temporary attachment, you could weave it back and forth through holes in the fabric, or hold it on temporarily with safety pins, zip ties, or clear tape.\rWhen you get to the other end, make an entry hole, if needed.  Leave about 2-3\" excess wire at the end.  Seal the end with heat-shrink tubing and/or glue, and mount it on the inside of the garment, as you did with the leading end.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2Z/35S4/FHOHI6CJ/F2Z35S4FHOHI6CJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FT3/NFE8/FHOHI6CI/FT3NFE8FHOHI6CI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVU/8SJ0/FHOHI6CH/FVU8SJ0FHOHI6CH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVU/UTB2/FHOHI6CG/FVUUTB2FHOHI6CG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Attach the EL Wire"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "First, you will need to deal with wire management inside the garment. There should be enough slack for the non-glowing connector wires to reach back to the inverter and battery without being pulled tightly when you move.  But, you also don't want so much excess wire that it will get snagged when you put it on.  I recommend using a big stitch to sew these wires to the seams on the inside of the garment.  If your jacket is unlined, this is especially helpful.  If your jacket has a lining, it may be sufficient to make some anchor points at key locations where the wire bends, like the armpits.\rAfter all the wires running back to the inverter and battery pocket are stabilized, reconnect them as needed.  They can be hard-wired to the driver, or joined to a plug if you want it to be easy to change it later.  Use heat-shrink tubing or other insulators to ensure that you do not short out the two conductors to each other.\rAdvice for the battery pocket:\rUse an existing pocket in the garment or add one, if necessary.  The pocket should be close to the size of the battery pack.  If you will be dancing or moving a lot in the coat, you don't want the battery pack to bounce around too much, or fall out.  Closing the pocket with a zipper or velcro can be helpful.\rClip a small part of the pocket seam, pass the wire through, and re-sew the seam closed so that the parts don't fall back into the lining.  If you do not plan to change the inverter, that part can be hidden in an inaccessible part inside the lining, or sewn into a separate closed section of a pocket.  Run the wire for the battery connector to that pocket.  There should be enough excess wire to easily access the end and change batteries.\rMany EL drivers run on 9V or 12V.  A standard 9V battery is good for many applications.  If you want longer battery life with a 9V system, you can also use a 6-pack of AA cells.  \r", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FT3/NFE8/FHOHI6CI/FT3NFE8FHOHI6CI.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Finishing Steps"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "In addition to lighting up the seams of a garment, EL wire can also be bent into shape to create logos and other designs, and sewn or glued to fabric.

Take your pick... Some people like to make their Halloween decorations from papier mache. We used raw, bleeding pig's hearts! Last year, we tried to decellularize some chicken hearts and gizzards at BioCurious for Halloween. This year, we tackled a full-size pig heart, with members of Counter Culture Labs, our new DIYbio group in the SF East Bay, with some help from friends at BioCurious. Decellularization is a tissue engineering technique designed to strip out all the cells from a donor organ, leaving nothing but the connective tissue that used to hold the cells in place. This scaffold of connective tissue - called a \"ghost organ\" for its pale and almost translucent appearance - can then be reseeded with a patient's own cells, with the goal of regenerating an organ that can be transplanted into the patient without fear of tissue rejection. A decellularized mouse heart regenerated with human heart precursor cells will actually start beating autonomously! Here's some amazing videos on this work by Doris Taylor at U. Minnesota:Creating a beating heart in the labSurprising Beauty, Holding A Pig's Heart Getting all the cells to coordinate correctly in a large heart is still a big challenge. That part is still years away from clinical use. We're just doing the first part though: decellularization of a pig heart. Why? Well, what self-respecting mad scientist wouldn't want to have a Ghost Heart in a Jar! If any of this seems way too challenging to you - note that none of us had ever done anything like this before! We just read up on what it took to do this, figured out where to get a pig heart, got a few pieces of equipment, ordered some chemicals, and got to it! The results look absolutely spectacular, and we learned tons along the way. Yes, this project is a bit complex, and there's lots of long words in the steps below - but don't let that scare you away! The whole thing can be accomplished in a single day, and we'll tell you about DIY alternatives for all the equipment and chemicals used here. The decellularization is achieved using enzymes and detergents to break open the cells and flush out the cellular content. The solutions need to be perfused throughout the heart muscle using a pump. Not just through the chambers of the heart, mind you, but actually through the coronary arteries that provide blood supply to the muscle of the heart itself. The published protocol takes approximately 10 hours, but since we are planning this as a show piece and not to reseed them with cells, we have taken some shortcuts. Please use appropriate safety equipment and measures. One of the nice aspects of this experiment is that all the chemicals you're working with are fairly non-toxic. But you're also working with lots of fluids under pressure, and you really, really don't want assorted pig heart juices squirting into your eyes - trust me on that! So make sure to wear some goggles at least. A lab coat to protect your clothes from giant blood stains wouldn't hurt either (unless you're into that kinda thing). If you use something like an aquarium pump please note the problems the solutions used could cause the pump, as well as contamination issues. A fountain pump from the hardware store might be another interesting alternative for high volume and relative high pressure. But most fountain pumps are immersion pumps, and are *not* designed to handle salty, conductive water - try at your own risk!

However, hearts that have been butchered for food typically have the arteries at the top of the heart cut off, and a slash through the chambers of the heart to let the blood drain out. Unfortunately, that makes them entirely unsuited for what we need. What you need is a pig heart that has been butchered specifically for biological experiments - what's called a \"bio-heart\" in the trade. The good folks at the California Academy of Sciences recommended C&M Meat Company, a meat wholesaler in Berkeley that should be able to get us a bio-heart fairly cheap. Unfortunately, when you're trying to get a single heart from a wholesaler... you're not exactly a high priority for them. They agreed to get us some bio-hearts, but only if we ordered at least five at a time. So after getting the runaround and wasting a couple more weeks of our time, we finally received a surprisingly neat cardboard box, containing five very raw, and very bloody pig hearts! Our bio-hearts came with about a foot or more of extra arteries attached. You'll need no more than about an inch of the aorta to attach a hose for the perfusion, so you may want to chop off some of the obviously extraneous bits at this point. While you're at it, rinse the heart under tap water to get rid of blood that might be left in the chambers, check that the aorta is intact, and that there aren't any nicks on the surface of the heart muscle. The first step in almost all decellularization protocols is to freeze the organ. That's partly for convenience, but the formation of ice crystals will also start breaking open the cells, starting the decellularization. So wrap your bio-hearts in separate plastic bags, chuck them in the freezer, and above all - don't tell your vegetarian wife!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FGT/DH7A/HNM4GE03/FGTDH7AHNM4GE03.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F42/Y70N/HNM4GE02/F42Y70NHNM4GE02.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Obtain a Pig \"bio-heart\""}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "\n          Lots of technical details here - feel free to skip ahead! This paper has a good overview of the various methods used for tissue decellularization:An overview of tissue and whole organ decellularization processes We actually have two different variations of the pig heart protocol: the one originally published by Wainwright et al in their 2010 paper, and the modified protocol from the 2012 video in the Journal of Visualized Experiments, by the same group. Both versions start with freezing at -80C and then thawing the heart, to help break up cells. Wainwright et al paper:    Perfuse 3L Type 1 reagent grade water for 15min at 1L/min, then 2xPBS (phosphate buffered saline) for 15min at 1L/min     Perfuse 0.02% trypsin / 0.05% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid / 0.05% NaN3 at 37C for 2h at 1 L/min     Perfuse Type 1 water for 5min, then 2xPBS for 15min     Perfuse 3% Triton X-100 / 0.05% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid / 0.05% NaN3 for 2h at 1.3L/min     Perfuse Type 1 water for 5min, then 2xPBS for 15min     Perfuse 4% deoxycholic acid solution for 2h at 1.3L/min     Perfuse Type 1 water for 5min, then 2xPBS for 15min     Perfuse 0.1% peracetic acid / 4% ethanol for 1h at 1.7L/min     Perfuse with PBS twice, and Type 1 water three times, 15min each at 1.7L/min  If you add everything together, this protocol takes about 10 hours from start to finish for all the perfusion steps. The modified version from the Jove video goes through much the same steps, lengthening the trypsin and deoxycholic acid treatment to 3h, and the detergent treatment to 2.5h, for a total time of around 13 hours perfusion! They also ramp the perfusion speed from 400ml/min for the initial water perfusion, to 2.2L/min for the deoxycholic and subsequent steps. In our case, we only had about 10 hours total to accomplish this, and we wound up spending a good amount of that time testing out the pump, fixing leaks in the connections, dissecting down the heart etc. So we wound up adjusting the durations to fit into the time remaining. On the other hand, since we were making a showpiece rather than a ghost heart that could be successfully reseeded with stem cells, we knew we could easily cheat on some of the ingredients. In particular, we used plain tap water instead of gallons and gallons of expensive \"Type 1\" reagent grade water. Likewise, we just used plain kitchen salt in tap water instead of phosphate buffered saline. We used OxyClean (sodium percarbonate) instead of peracetic acid, and 151-proof Everclear instead of reagent grade ethanol for the final disinfection step. We also wanted to use SDS rather than Triton X-100 as the detergent, since SDS tends to whiten the tissue better (at the expense of being somewha harsher on the extracellular matrix). We didn't have quite enough SDS, so we wound up going with 2% SDS / 1% Triton X-100. We also left out the sodium azide (NaN3), which is there to inhibit bacterial growth, but is also very toxic - something we'd rather not mess with in a DIY setting. Oh, and we didn't have access to a high-volume peristaltic pump, but we did have a Bio-Rad Buffer Recirculation Pump (see http://www.bio-rad.com/webroot/web/pdf/lsr/literature/M1702929C.pdf\u200e) that can theoretically do up to 1.5L/min. Not intended to supply the kind of pressures we need, but meh - let's just see what happens... So here's what we wound up with in the end:    Perfuse 3L tapwater for 15min, then high saline (50g kitchen salt in 3L tapwater) for 15min     Perfuse 0.02% trypsin / 0.05% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid at 37C for 1.5h     Perfuse tapwater for 10min, then high saline for 10min     Perfuse 2% SDS / 1% Triton X-100 for 50min     Perfuse tapwater for 5min, then high saline for 5min     Perfuse 2.5% deoxycholic acid (25g in 1L) for 20min     Perfuse tapwater for 5min, then high saline for 5min     Perfuse 0.5% OxyClean / 4% ethanol for 1h at 1.7L/min     Perfuse saline (25g in 3L), then tap water for 5min     Let drain, then stuff into Ikea jar with 151 proof Everclear!

The \"bio-hearts\" didn't merely have an intact aorta - they had about a foot of arteries and other gristly stuff attached. So our first task was to dissect all that down. Luckily, at least one of us had some experience doing dissections... the vegan! The technique we're using here to push fluids through the heart muscle is called retrograde coronary perfusion. Interestingly, this same technique can also be used in what's called a Langendorff preparation to keep a beating heart alive, by pumping nutrient-rich oxygenated fluids through it. The reason it's called \"retrograde\" is because you push fluids into the aorta, whereas in normal operation, blood comes out of the aorta. Essentially, we're hacking the cardiac system, taking advantage of a peculiarity of the heart's plumbing! Normally, oxygen rich blood comes from the lungs into the left atrium, from which it is pumped through the aortic valve, into the aorta, and then from there to feed the rest of the body. But the very first thing that gets fed by this freshly oxygenated blood is the heart muscle itself, through two coronary arteries located just above the aortic valve (see the schematic above). Now, when we push fluids retrograde into the aorta, that pressure will cause the aortic valve to close, and the only place for that fluid to go is through the coronary arteries into the heart muscle - cool, no? After separating the aorta cleanly from the pulmonary artery and trimming it down a bit (to just below the brachiocephalic artery, the smaller artery connecting to the aorta closest to the heart), we inserted a brass barbed hose connector into the aorta (5/8\" into the aorta, to 1/2\" for the tubing) and tightened it securely with a wide hose clamp. But apparently not tightly enough, since we accidentally pulled it out a couple steps later... After connecting the 1/2\" vinyl tubing to the heart and the pump and tightening all the connectors with hose clamps, we lowered the heart into 3 liters of tap water in a giant 4 liter beaker, turned on the pump - and discovered we had sprung a leak! Apparently our butcher wasn't too careful and put a tiny nick in one of the small arteries on the surface of the heart, through which a lot of our pressurized water was now escaping... Remembering that superglue (cyanoacrylate) has been used to replace stitches in surgery, we decide to give it a try on our little leak. Worked perfectly!

Trypsin is most active at body temperature, so warm the solution to 37C in advance. EDTA acts synergistically with trypsin: it is a calcium chelator, which integrins needs to interact with other proteins for cell adhesion, so EDTA by itself will loosen the bonds between cells. But it also acts to mop up divalent cations that would otherwise inhibit trypsin activity. This step is one of the workhorses in terms of breaking open cells, and degrading and flushing out their content. You'll still see a lot of blood coming out, but it's definitely not just blood alone, and by the end of this step you'll notice the heart getting significantly paler. Trypsin can be purchased online but If you can\u2019t get your hands on trypsin or want to do a DIY version, you could use other proteases that are much easier to find. Bromelain is the enzyme that is responsible for making the inside of your mouth hurt after eating too much raw pineapple. Fresh papaya has a similar enzyme called papain. Both of these are fairly easy to find as digestive enzymes at your local health food store. Or in your local grocery store under \"meat tenderizer\"!

Here we wanted to test on resting persons and so categorised the BPM above and below this range into five categories accordingly.Alarming ( below 40)  - (blue)Warning ( 40 to 60) - (gradient from blue to green)Good ( 60 to 100) - (green)Warning (100 to 120) - (gradient from green to red)Alarming (above 120) - (red)The logic for categorising BPM into these categories is:if (BPM<40)R=0G=0B=0if (40 < BPM < 60)R = 0G = (((BPM-40)/20)*255)B = (((60-BPM)/20)*255)if (60 < BPM < 100)R = 0G = 255B = 0if (100 < BPM <120)R = (((BPM-100)/20)*255)G = (((120-BPM)/20)*255)B = 0if (120 < BPM)R = 255G = 0B = 0You can make use of Processing Visualizer App to validate the pulse sensor and see how the BPM and IBI changes. Using the visualiser needs special libraries, if you think serial plotter is not helpful, you can make use of this program, in which processes the BPM data into a readable input for Visualizer.There are several ways to measure heart beat using the pulse sensor without pre-loaded libraries. We used the following logic, which was used in one of similar applications, using five pulses to calculate the heart beat.Five_pusle_time=time2-time1;Single_pulse_time= Five_pusle_time /5;rate=60000/ Single_pulse_time; where time1 is first pulse counter value time2 is list pulse counter value rate is final heart rate.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F4P/CASB/JBE12GPH/F4PCASBJBE12GPH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2N/6V8V/JBE12XAJ/F2N6V8VJBE12XAJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF8/FD9Y/JBE12UZA/FF8FD9YJBE12UZA.LARGE.jpg", "/assets/img/pixel.png"], "step_title": "Step 2: Programming"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "For the comfort of measurement and safety of electronics its advisable to make an enclosure.

They trump radio since I can listen to them anytime I like, fast forward past ads and share them with friends. Librivox provides hours of free entertainment courtesy of the classics. Yes, this means that Voltaire's Candide is ready at 6am on a Saturday while repainting a bedroom!\nI don't have a car, by choice. My neighborhood has stores nearby and bus lines that make it perfect for walking or public transit. Ever since I can remember, I've loved to take long walks around my neighborhood and explore the world at a human pace. Portable audio was the perfect match! The side streets are quiet, with minimal car traffic. However, I still need to filter out the noise around me especially on buses, the metro and noisy sidewalks next to busy streets. Cranking up the volume is one option, but not healthy for ears that need to last a lifetime.\nA few years ago, I discovered Koss Plug headphones that insert an expanding foam plug within the ear canal, like the safety earplugs I used when mowing lawns. The first time I tried them out, they fit perfectly into my ear and blotted out even the loudest noises. Rumbling city buses and poorly tuned cars no longer interrupted my news feeds, science articles and audiobooks.\nThe plugs performed well for the first five or six times, but changed their resilience over time. The slow recovery property or memory of the foam seemed to fade, so it became harder to position them inside my ear at the depth required to block sound. They seemed to lose springiness too. If I turned my head, one edge of the foam edge would deform and block the center channel, silencing one of my ears until the foam spring back. During winter, the edges of my hat or hood covering my ears would would have the same effect, tilting the plug inside my ear and blocking the channel. Plus, the plugs would eventually get dirty from earwax - yuck!\nI remembered further back to a pair of silicone earplugs, EarPlanes, that worked much better than the foam safety earplugs. They were made from a hollow silicone tube with a cylindrical portion on one end and flanges at the other. The central channel had a ceramic element for equalizing air pressure. The directions suggest placing the flanges inside the ear canal, but they worked better by using the other tapered cylindrical end.\nMaybe someone had already combined these ideas together. Jabra headsets come close, but don't place the silicone tube far enough in the ear. Other instructables teaches how to modify earplugs with the same expanding earplug foam as the Koss design.https://www.instructables.com/id/Improve-Your-In-Ear-Monitors/ https://www.instructables.com/id/Poor-Man-Noise-Canceling-EarBud-Headphones/https://www.instructables.com/id/Create_the_Ultimate_Noise_Cancelling_Earphones/\nSince the silicone material in EarPlanes doesn't compress, they wouldn't deform and close up when I turned my head or wore a hat. A search for silicone ear plugs turned up many designs for earbuds described as \"in-ear,\" but they don't extend far enough into the ear to block sound adequately. Plus, it seems that my ears are smaller than most of the designs out there, so they keep falling out.\nOK, enough yakking!

Taper the caulk along each ink tube, so you'll have a variety of diameters to pick from when trimming the silicone tube. It's important to do this in a single step, to keep the outer surface of the caulk smooth. Also, try to keep the ink tube in the center of the caulk so that the channel is concentric with the outer edges. \nSilicone caulk takes about 24 hours to cure properly. As it cures from the outer surface to the inside, you might be tempted to remove it from the ink tubes prematurely. Wait at least a full 24 hours before moving on to the next step, since uncured silicone contacting the ink tubes needs to cure completely to form the inner channel wall. \nI tried other templates to make the inner channel like metal coat hangers, but they adhered too well to the cured silicone adhesive and wouldn't detach to form a channel.

Understanding the ECGIn general terms, let\u2019s look at what an ECG is representing andhow we\u2019re able to sense it. The ECG is separated into two basicIntervals, the PR Interval and the QT Interval, described below.ii. PR IntervalThe PR interval is the initial wave generated by an electricalimpulse traveling from the right atrium to the left. The rightatrium is the first chamber to see an electrical impulse. Thiselectrical impulse causes the chambers to \u201cdepolarize\u201d. Thisforces it to contract and drain deoxygenated blood from boththe Superior and Inferior vena cava into the right ventricle. Asthe electrical impulse travels across the top of the heart it thentriggers the left atrium to contract. The left atrium isresponsible for receiving newly oxygenated blood from thelungs into the left ventricle via the left and right pulmonaryveins. The pulmonary veins are red in the diagram becausethey are carrying oxygenated blood. They are still called veinsbecause veins carry blood towards the heart. Science!iii. QT IntervalThe QT Interval is where things get really interesting. The QRSis a complex process that generates the signature \u201cbeep\u201d incardiac monitors. During QRS both ventricles begin to pump.The right ventricle begins to pump deoxygenated blood intothe lungs through the left and right pulmonary arteries. Thepulmonary arteries are blue in the diagram because they arecarrying deoxygenated blood. They are still called arteriesbecause arteries carry blood away the heart. Science, Again!The left ventricle is also beginning to pump freshly oxygenatedblood through the aorta and into the rest of the body. Afterthe initial contraction comes the ST segment. The ST segmentis fairly quiet electrically as it is the time where the ventricleswaiting to be \u201cre-polarized\u201d. Finally the T wave becomespresent to actively \u201cre-polarize\u201d, or relax the ventricles. Thisrelaxation phase resets the ventricles to be filled again by theatriums.5- Temperature sensorAstronauts are exposed to a wide variety of temperature during theirmissions which can range from -250F to 250F so a temperature sensor isused to monitor the temperature and gives a warning message whennecessary.6- Pressure sensor , one of important concerns of the factors which impactsthe health of the astronaut is that the increased pressure in the eye maycause what is called \u201cOcular hypertension\u201d which causes problems in thevision and may lead to blindness so a pressure sensor is used to keep trackof the pressure and gives a warning message if the pressure exceeds acertain limit.7- IMU (Inertial measurement unit) \u2013 9DOF \u2013 Accelerometer,gyroscope, Magnetometer.in our plan of future work we added IMU in order to develop a gameslike Smart phones apps which depends on gyroscope , Accelerometersensors .8- HD-Web-Camera 720p (Microsoft 3000 HD)Which has the ability to stream a real-time video with delay 40 ms with 30frame per second through Wi-Fi dongle that connected to raspberry pimicro-computer and works as a webcam server over localhost (raspberry piip port 8080 ) .", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FIW/2V51/IQRJ9ZG3/FIW2V51IQRJ9ZG3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNM/RHA5/IQRJ9ZGS/FNMRHA5IQRJ9ZGS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY9/JKO5/IQRJ9ZGR/FY9JKO5IQRJ9ZGR.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Our System"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "1- Space Station Software.The main aim of our GUI is to provide the space station with a live feedof the current astronaut status in order to ensure a total supervisionover the astronaut and monitor his currentHealth condition in addition to providing an easy and simple means ofcommunication with the astronaut.GUI Features:o Health monitoring:\uf0a7 Monitoring the heart statues via a live cardiogram.\uf0a7 Live feed for the current temperature.\uf0a7 Live feed for the current pressure.o GUI provides warning messages if the temperature or the pressureexceeds certain limits.o Ease of communication support:o Providing a high quality live streaming for the camera fixed on theastronaut suit.o Chat facility between the space station and the astronaut via the GUIon the astronaut wearable.o All the received data, received and sent chat messages are loggedand displayed in a user friendly way accompanied by thecorresponding date and time.o Saving all data as txt log files.2- Wearable Device SoftwareA GUI programmed by Python that allow Astronauts to show theirhealth status, sensors reads with options of Chat, on-screen keyboard,keystroke software that save all astronauts keyboard inputs on thescreen, option to start live streaming.- Saving all data as excel log files .- This application also contains bash script to run the required packagesin boot.3- Arduino CodeInterfacing code with the sensors and ZigBee module to send a the datain a way of serial communication with Raspberry pi \u201cwearable softwarethrough usb cable \u201c and Space station software by ZigBee Ad-hocknetwork .c.

If I'm wrong, please let me know and I'll attribute it.\nI don't care what kind of earbud you use, this one small, free preparation will change your appreciation of your MP3 music for life.\nAs a designer, I had to learn how sound travels through air. \u00a0Sound is pervasive because all it needs is a tiny gap to get through. \u00a0It doesn't have to be a straight gap either, like light. \u00a0It will travel through twisting pathways with ease (engineers use sound to trace water leaks). \u00a0That's why, with even the most expensive, best fitting earbuds, you can still hear the world around you... And you're being cheated of hearing the full sound your earbuds are capable of producing. \u00a0Your also being cheated out of the one thing that no one expects from earbuds... \"Feeling\" the music.\nThe sounds you hear in a closed auditorium, at a live concert, are created by pressure waves. \u00a0These waves are contained within the building space and why you \"feel\" the music vibrating within your body. \u00a0The pressure waves are all around, \"bumping\" you, so you sense the music, in perfect harmony with your hearing... From the boom of the \"I got big speakers at the stoplight\" \u00a0of the deep bass all the way to the drummer hitting the rim of the snare drum with his stick.\nMost of these sounds and all of the feelings are lost through the microscopic gaps that exist between your earpiece and your skin when you attempt to reproduce them with earbuds.\nNo longer.\nSimply smearing the rubber seal of your earbud with a thick, slippery liquid like waterless hand soap will seal the gap between the earbud and your ear. \u00a0ALL of the pressure waves will be trapped within your ear canal and you will hear - and feel - a completely new level of sound from your mp3 player.\nYour own personal sound booth, right between your ears. \u00a0Oh, and if you have any music that was recorded with analog equipment, listen for the tape hiss... It'll be there:-)\nWhat you need:\n1. A non-leathal, non-medicating, slippery lotion, intended to be applied to human skin. \u00a0I've experimented with a large number of materials and have decided to use waterless hand soap. \u00a0It's non-toxic, biodegradable and evaporates when I pull the buds from my ears to store them (it also evaporates when I see my wife's lips moving and have to pull them to hear what she's saying... Yes, the seal is that good).\n2. Smear a very tiny amount onto your earbud plugs. \u00a0Not too much. \u00a0Just enough to make the rubber \"shiny\".\n3. Put them into your ears and \"smush\" them around a bit to \"close up the gap\" as they'd say in the Marine Corps. \u00a0You'll need to \"yawn\" as you do this, which opens the ear canal to your throat, so you can equalize the pressure inside your ear. \u00a0If you use custom fit earbuds, you'll find they slip in easier.\n4. Play your music... And this is important... DON'T PUT THEM AT FULL VOLUME. \u00a0You won't need to and you can damage your ears \"real good\". \u00a0I'm not responsible for any damage caused by non-inteligent use of this idea. \u00a0The same goes for any live concert where the sound pressure can damage the delicate parts of your hearing... USE SMARTS\n5. Say \"Goodby\" to those around you and disappear from the outside world.\n6. Enjoy... Then\u00a0vote for me :-)\nAs an additional tweak, I emptied a hotel-sized hair soap bottle and re--filled it with waterless hand cleaner which I keep in my pocket.... I can also wash my hands with it... I won't hear what you're saying, but I'll be very clean :-)\nOne caveat... The type of earbud shown hear (pun), once made slippery, will want to slide out of your ear, breaking the seal. \u00a0This is a good rationalization to make your earbuds custom fitting. \u00a0Once you do, your earbuds will \"snap\" into position and stay there. \u00a0Here's the best Instructable I've found to guide you through converting them... It's easy: Here\nIf you like my stuff, you can get all of it for free on my personal Instructable app HERE \u00a0(no ulterior motive... I'm not a salesman and I'm not a politician...

It work on the principal of Electrodermal activity (EDA), sounds bizarre. Electrodermal activity refers to the variation of the electrical properties of the skin in response to sweat secretion. Our exposed skin always contain small amount of sweat, no matter what is the temperature outside. (see above pics)Human body contain lots of nerves, which conduct signal from our brain to periphery and vice versa. These are divided into sympathetic nerves and parasympathetic nerves. These nerves are involuntary i.e. we can\u2019t consciously control them. Our main focus area is on sympathetic nerves, because these are the nerves which control our sweat glands.So, if you are alive (you must be, otherwise there is no way you can, read this), then your brain is continuously commanding your sweat glands via sympathetic nerves to produce sweat. Sweat (good electrolyte) this means we can use our body to conduct electricity.What happens if a person is dead ?If a person is dead, that means his/her brain is not working, the signal to turn ON the sweat glands will be off.

Right most leg of the transistor is collector, middle one is base, left most is emitter. Battery output is connected to the skin via input probe, this initiates flow of current throughout the body. The base of the transistor is one which measures the feeble current which is flowing throughout the body. If base of the transistor detects a current, it then allow a larger current to flow from collector to emitter. The LED and buzzer are connected in the path of current which flow between collector and emitter. If base detects any current it will turn ON the LED and buzzer.c) Probes (Input & Output):In the device, both input and output probes are the extension of wires, which are electrically conductive. Input probe allow current to flow from 9V battery to human skin via sweat. Output probe detects the feeble current which is flowing in the human body and then directs the current to the base of the transistor.d) Output (LED & Buzzer):LED and buzzer are the output component of the device. As already described,  LED and buzzer are connected in between 9V battery and the emitter of the transistor. If base which is connected with the output probe, detects any current in the body, it will allow current to flow from collector to emitter, which will then turn ON LED and buzzer.Schematic:see above pictures for schematic diagram.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FNM/1GHU/I9PGV1S6/FNM1GHUI9PGV1S6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F08/SKHC/I9PGV1RY/F08SKHCI9PGV1RY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG7/40DN/I9PGUK0X/FG740DNI9PGUK0X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR2/Q44E/I9PGUJU2/FR2Q44EI9PGUJU2.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Now Let\u2019s Make Device Itself:"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "GIF animation is not supported here, if you want to view animation of the device, you can watch it here or http://rafalerobotics.in/doaos/3/ For more richer experience, view this article in my website, by clicking here.Animation explained:The small inverted triangle  in the above animation represents the battery. First current flows from battery to the red probe  and in the skin. Then current starts flowing from one end of the skin to the other end. When the current reached the other side of the skin, it is picked up by the black probe  The black probe samples the current from the skin and into the base of the transistor.

Then swallow it without chewing.    Put a pencil horizontally in your mouth and while biting down on it, try to drink a glass of water without letting the pencil fall out.    Break a toothpick in half and put one half in a glass of water. Drink the water slowly while keeping your eye on the toothpick (so not to swallow it).     Fill up a glass of water halfway and then lay upside-down with your head hung over an edge (ie: on your bed). Pull yourself up to take a drink, then return to the upside-down position.    Drink half a teaspoon of pickle juice every 5-10 seconds until the hiccups stop    Lean your head back and place a penny on your forehead.    Put one straw in a glass of water and the other outside of the glass. Drink a few big gulps from both straws so you're sucking up water and air at the same time. Medicinal drugs for relieving hiccups and intractable (stubborn) hiccups include:Baclofen (A central nervous system depressant used as a skeletal muscle relaxant. It is primarily used to treat spasticity. It is also used by compounding pharmacies in topical pain creams as a muscle relaxant.)    Chlorpromazine (This is an anti-psychotic medication. It is primarily used to treat psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. Other uses include the treatment of bipolar disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, nausea and vomiting, anxiety before surgery, and hiccups that do not improve following other measures.)    Metoclopramide (A medication used mostly for stomach and esophageal problems. It is commonly used to treat nausea and vomiting, to help with emptying of the stomach in people with delayed stomach emptying due to either diabetes or following surgery, and to help with gastroesophageal reflux disease.)    Gabapentin (A medication used to treat epilepsy, neuropathic pain, hot flashes, and restless leg syndrome.)  Various proton-pump inhibitors (A group of drugs whose main action is a pronounced and long-lasting reduction of gastric acid production.)    Installing lidocaine liniment 3% or gel 2% into the ear canal (Lidocaine is a medication used to numb tissue in a specific area and to treat ventricular tachycardia.[3][4] It can also be used for nerve blocks.)    Haloperidol (Aka: Haldol, an anti-psychotic and sedative medication.)    Metoclopramide (Aka: Reglan, a gastrointestinal stimulant.)    Rhlorpromazine (Aka: Thorazine, an anti-psychotic with strong sedative effects.)    Sedatives     Persistent digital rectal massage (No explanation needed...you can tell what this is by the name.) A vagus nerve stimulator implanted in the upper chest (A vagus nerve simulator sends rhythmic bursts of electricity to the brain by way of the vagus nerve, which passes through the neck. The Food and Drug Administration approved the vagus nerve stimulator in 1997 as a way to control seizures in some patients with epilepsy.)Now that you're well informed (and you can see how some of these remedies or drugs COULD be dangerous for you in more ways than one), let's discuss the cure for hiccups and WHY it works scientifically...", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FD6/JGL9/IMNQO59F/FD6JGL9IMNQO59F.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Fact or Fiction?"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "By definition, a \"cure\" is something that \"relieve[s] (a person or animal) of the symptoms of a disease or condition.\" Therefore, I call this approach a \"cure.\"This works....EVERY time. And it requires nothing but YOURSELF to achieve.When you get a bout of hiccups, simply:1. Take a deep breath in, then plug your nose and squeeze your lips shut so that you're holding your breath (make sure you don't cheat and breathe out of your nose or mouth--deliberately hold your breath).2. While you're holding your breath completely, swallow hard a few times (at least 2-3 or until you can't do anymore). Make sure each one is a full swallow and that you don't cheat and breathe out of your mouth or nose during swallows.That's it. The hiccups will now stop immediately and not return (until the next time you decide that Ghost Pepper you just ate wasn't hot enough and try a Carolina Reaper!) ;)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FPH/ICEQ/IMNQO5G7/FPHICEQIMNQO5G7.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: The Cure..."}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "To dive into WHY it works, we need to first establish WHAT a hiccup is in the first place.\"A hiccup is an involuntary contraction (myoclonic jerk) of the diaphragm that may repeat several times per minute. In medicine, it is known as synchronous diaphragmatic flutter (SDF), or singultus, Latin for the act of catching one's breath while sobbing. The hiccup is an involuntary action involving a reflex arc. Once triggered, the reflex causes a strong contraction of the diaphragm followed about 0.25 seconds later by closure of the vocal cords, which results in the classic 'hic' sound.\"This is the basic definition you can find by simply googling, \"what is a hiccup.\" So let's break that down into simpler terms. Basically, when functioning normally, the diaphragm pulls down to help pull air into your lungs when you inhale, and then relaxes to let the air flow back out of the lungs through the mouth and nose. When the diaphragm is irritated, it pulls down in a jerky way which makes you suck air into your throat suddenly. The air rushing in hits your voice box, and your vocal cords close suddenly. This results in a \"hiccup.\" Since your diaphragm is contracting (basically it's experiencing involuntary spasms), you counteract this movement by giving it something else to do (the holding breath and swallowing), which disrupts the spasms and therefore stops the hiccups. The holding breath and swallowing works because...hiccups \"are inhibited by elevations in PaCO2; this serves as the basis for breath holding or breathing into a paper bag as a common therapeutic intervention.\" Also from this site regarding hiccup self-care remedies: \"They include rapidly swallowing water or ice chips, breath holding, and re-breathing from a paper bag. In all of these cases, a subsequent elevation in PaCO2 could explain positive results when they occur.\" Emphasis mine, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC300666... (The exact citations that this website uses for these claims are listed with asterisks * in the footnote of this step.)This is the same concept that all the other self-care methods are trying to achieve, except they just didn't put 2 and 2 together (the swallowing action WITH the holding your breath). The reason most of the remedies don't always work is because they are only using a one-part approach. So the cure in this instructable is basically the \"double whammy\" on your hiccups (giving your diaphragm a supercharged counteracting), therefore it works every time (when done properly). Continued research done by experts:From Huffington Post's article http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/11/get-rid-h... Brian Udermann, Ph.D., an exercise and sports science professor at the University of Wisconsin La Crosse and the author of \u201c25 Ways to Cure the Hiccups: Uncovering the Truth Behind 101 Common Myths and Misconceptions\" explains that:\"Anything you do in regard to your breath, [makes it] possible that you could disrupt that nerve impulse from the brain to the diaphragm so you stop the hiccups.' A little extra carbon dioxide may also help to relax the diaphragm, according to Dr. Oz, although we don't know exactly why.\" (emphasis mine)The article continues...\"Swallowing -- which, when you think about it, is a temporary change in your breathing...may override those diaphragm spasms, according to Reader's Digest Canada. 'It doesn't matter if you drink upside down or sideways or from a spoon,' says Udermann. 'It's that act that could be disruptive.' \" (emphasis mine)His response to if you eat a spoonful of anything is: \"But there's not likely anything specific about the peanut butter or the sugar or the bitters that's easing those hiccups. Like with drinking and breathing tricks, eating has the potential to affect your breath and therefore your diaphragm.\" (emphasis mine) Discovery Health (in this same article) answers in regards to being scared as a hiccup cure:\"A little scare could work for two reasons. First of all, it's likely to change your breathing cycle -- hear that gasp you just made? It may also work as a mental distraction, which seems to quell hiccups. Want proof? Have someone ask you to hiccup on the spot, and see what happens.\" (emphasis mine)THE BOTTOM LINE: You need to counteract the spasm that is going on in your diaphragm. Since the diaphragm is used in breathing (inhaling and exhaling), anything that effects your breathing will be suitable in counteracting it's spasms. Swallowing and holding your breath go hand-in-hand (as research here proves that swallowing is just another alternative to holding your breath in how it works in the body), so this gives a blasting boost of disruption to your diaphragm, particularly when used together (versus separately). Therefore, IT WORKS.Though there are many more studies we can find and experts we can ask about why this cure works (versus just holding your breath or just eating/swallowing), but the main points have been presented here and the rest would be repetitive.  So, if you want more research--DO YOUR RESEARCH (it's fun!) :) And I hope this cure and the knowledge presented here have helped you dive deeper into the somewhat-mysterious world of hiccups!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*Aldrich T.

It is important to pay attention to how you feel after you eat different foods and work out which make you feel well and which don't. Eating at least five different fruit and vegetables a day is very important. Recently some scientists have suggested seven might be better but the important thing is to eat as many as you can and mak sure you enjoy them. If it becomes an ordeal for you it might put you off altogether. You should minimise saturated fat, meat, refined sugars, processed foods, preserved meats and alcohol. This will reduce your risks of cancer, heart disease and diabetes. There is growing evidence that green tea has anti-cancer properties. It is best if brewed for 10 minutes to maximise the transfer of antioxidants. If it is too bitter for your taste you could add a drop of honey. Sencha has the highest antioxidant content of all green teas. It is important to drink plenty of clear fluids generally; your urine should be a clear light colour.- Exercise. It can be difficult for people to maintain regular exercise regimes. Tiredness and being too busy often lead to good intentions falling by the wayside. The key is to integrate exercise into your everyday activity. For example, you could walk, cycle or run to work or to the shops. It might seem like too much to take on to start with but you can always try it and see how it goes, rather than trying to commit to too much at the beginning. It is helpful to try and spot other advantages to your new regime to encourage you. For example, walking to work means you can save on petrol, parking fees, miss the jams and pick up some coffee and apples on the way. Exercise and diet are key to reducing obesity which will make you healthier and happier.Swimming is an excellent form of exercise because it has high cardiovascular impact but low impact on the joints. Unfortunately some people develop ear infections as a result, known as swimmer's ear. This is a result of the action of water, bacteria and chemicals such as chlorine, soap and perfumes on the delicate skin lining the ear canals. Inflammation and infection may occur. If you wear a good pair of molded swimming ear plugs it can prevent the condition. I invented ZenPlugs Molded Ear Plugs as a solution to the problems people were having with ear plugs. They are molded to the ears so are very comfortable and their customised seal makes a great seal against sound and water.- Sleep. Research on sleep has featured prominently in the news recently. The NHS recommend 6 - 9 hours per night but a report by The Sleep Council shows that 40% of people aren't getting this much. Lack of sleep has been associated with obesity, cancer, anxiety and depression. Like many of the other factors on this page, if you don't sleep well then improving the other areas of your life might help. Exercising, good diet, meditation and intellectual stimulation can all aid good sleep. Tips for a good night's sleep include avoiding back-lit screens for a couple of hours before bed and using a herbal sleep aid such as valerian. Keeping to a regular bedtime and creating a bedtime routine also help. Have a cup of chamomile tea in the bath whilst reading a relaxing book. This will program your brain when to go to sleep.ZenPlugs Molded Ear Plugs are also ideal for use whilst sleeping. They don't protrude from your ears so stay comfortable even when you are lying on your side. The powerful antibacterial effect from Steritouch uses silver to kill all the bacteria known to cause ear infections. If noise at night is a probelem for you and you are losing sleep it will definitely be worth you while investing in a decent pair of ear plugs for sleeping.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F6B/H0V5/J98RBKHR/F6BH0V5J98RBKHR.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Body"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "For many people religion will boost this part of their lives but there are other ways you can feed your soul. Meditation is a useful tool to help you relate well to yourself and give you a feeling of purpose and place in the universe. Exercise and good diet work synergistically with meditation to create a sense of wholeness, wellness and happiness which will nurture your inner being. In summary, the pursuit of wellness and healthy living go hand-in-hand and are a long-term commitment. Taking a holistic approach helps to give you an action plan. By focusing on mind, body and soul you can give yourself direction and you will find that anything you do for one will have a knock-on effect on the others. Key areas to consider are exercise, diet, sleep and balancing your inner being with religion or meditation.

It is important that you have regular intellectual stimulation to remain happy. What form this will take is different for everybody. Some people need to be learning new things and feeling challenged whereas others would be better off applying their knowledge. Reading regularly can be enough for many people to feel fulfilled in this area. A stimulating chat with a friend can also boost you intellectually and emotionally. Perhaps this is why so many of the longest-living groups on the planet are based on strong social foundations. If you don't have an intellectually satisfying job you will need to seek this fulfillment in your spare time. As you read this article it is worth thinking about which of these areas are already covered by your current work and home life and which areas need looking at. - Emotional. Emotional wellbeing is probably one of the harder ones to address. If a person is overly emotional and this is causing problems then balancing the other areas of their life may help to balance the emotions. Regular meditation can be useful to weed out buried emotions which are causing unhappiness in everyday life. Good counselling can also do this. These practices can remove the barriers and allow the feelings to come out. This can be painful but is therapeutic in the long run. The individual has to want to work through it and persevere even when it is upsetting. Make sure you have fun and enjoy yourself. Any of the activities here can be fun but spend time doing things you enjoy, just for the sake of doing them.

It cannot be used for someone who's heart has stopped completely.Both V-tach and V-fib will show no pulse because the blood cannot circulate properly so you won't be able to tell if it's V-tach V-fib or stopped completely.

A stethoscope is a device used by medical professionals to listen to theinternal sounds of the body. The scientific concept relevant to this project is for theroll and funnel to act as a homemade stethoscope by amplifying the sound waves by\u00a0picking up vibration in an enclosed place.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Body of Report\nRene- Theophile-Hyacinthe Laennec a French physician invented the stethoscopein 1816, the idea came to him when he witnessed children playing with a long pieceof wood that transmitted the sound of pins scratching the surface. After making the\u00a0observation he rolled up a piece of paper into the shape of a funnel. He then used thepaper funnel to listen to the chests of his patients. Discovering the funnel amplifiedthe sounds from his patient\u2019s chests, he built a 25cm by 2.5cm hollowed wooden\u00a0cylinder. This cylinder replaced the rolled up paper tube as a device to listen to his\u00a0patient\u2019s chest.\nHe later modified this device with detachable parts. He noted the various sounds heheard with his original stethoscope and related them to his patient\u2019s body structure\u00a0finding the sounds of their organs. He published his findings in 1819 and the\u00a0stethoscope coming from a Greek word \u201cstethos\u201d (meaning chest) was born. As he\u00a0neared death Laennec often referred to the stethoscope as \u201cthe cylinder\u201d. These projects will benefit society by making it easier and cheaper for people to use it to amplify sounds for different purposes. Stethoscopes have been used for many reasons like to indicate both normal and abnormal functioning of the body's organs. Some stethoscopes are specially designed to monitor vibration sounds, and for unborn babies heartbeat or blood flow, also they are used for listening to sounds produced inside the body. There are many different type of stethoscopes such as acoustic stethoscope which function by using a chest piece with hollow tubes that go to the listener\u2019s ear, electronic stethoscope which electronically amplify the body sound, noise reduction stethoscopes which are built with surrounding area of noise filtering system, and recording stethoscopes which are used when providing evaluations and consultations to patient with certain conditions, also fetal stethoscopes these are used for pregnant women\u2019s in order to listen to the heartbeat of the fetus.", "title": "\"The Three Magic Stethoscopes\"", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/The-Three-Magic-Stethoscopes/", "section": "home", "steps": [], "channel": "No channel to show"}, {"category": "No category to show", "description": "  In July 2008, I was assimilated by the Borg...  ...not really.

So an ICD is used to treat heart rhythm disorders known as cardiac arrhythmias.  \"An Arrhythmia is an abnormal rhythm of the heart and is caused by problems with your heart's electrical system. The electrical impulses may happen too fast, too slowly, or erratically - causing the heart to beat too fast, too slowly, or erratically. There are two basic kinds of arrhythmias. Bradycardia is when the heart rate is too slow - less than 60 beats per minute. Tachycardia is when the heart rate is too fast - more than 100 beats per minute.\" -Heart.org Here is a pretty sweet video of what an arrhythmia looks like. Although broken down in two basic types of arrhythmias, these two categories break down into further types of arrhythmias.  Arrhythmias can be extremely dangerous; they can lead to stroke and cardiac arrest. I have multiple types of arrhythmias:  supraventricular (SVT), bradycardia, ventricular tachycardia(Vtach) and ventricular fibrillation. Getting an ICD was not an easy decision, and it came after many other methods were attempted to correct the arrhythmias. I'm going to share some tips I have for living with this cardiac disorder, and an ICD.Please note: I am NOT a medical processional, just a nerd sharing my experiences and how I manage living with cardiac arrhythmia disorders.

My electrophysiologists (EPs) had prescribed various anti-arrhythmatic medications (namely beta-blockers), and I have had four attempted radio frequency catheter ablations. A radio frequency catheter ablation is when the EPs guide catheters through veins and into the heart, and use radiofrenquency energy to destroy the tiny area of heart tissue that causes the irregular/fast heartbeats. The ablations were not successful because the locations of origin of my arrhythmias are very sporadic and random; my current EP theorizes that I do not have any one single location that they originate from.  An ICD is not cure, and does not prevent arrhythmias; when it detects an abnormal rhythm, the ICD treats the heart with electric therapy to restore a normal rhythm. The ICD consists of a generator, and leads. The number of leads depends on what type of therapies are delivered. Single chamber ICDs have one lead, which enters the heart thru the ventricles, while dual chamber ICDs have two, the additional lead entering thru the atrium.

I have only (thankfully) been defibrillated twice. Definitely feels like an intense electrical shock going through the whole body.Cardioversion treatment is what I experience most often. It's a strange sensation; it feels like there is a second heartbeat, trying to guide my own to it's natural rhythm. There's also dizziness and chest pressure, followed by immense gratitude that the device works ;)The pacing function is for bradycardia, when the heart is not pumping fast enough. This also feels like having two heartbeats, but is not as intense as cardioversion. The ICD is constantly monitoring, and records every arrhythmia regardless of whether or not treatment is delivered (some of mine are rather short and do not require pacing before they self-terminate). I receive ICD checkups every three months. A device technician extracts the information from the ICD through a special computer the communicates with the ICD. It shows the number and types of arrhythmias, date and time of when they occurred, the duration, what type of treatment was used... it's kind of neat to see the graphical representation of how the ICD treats :) The EP can also make adjustments to the programming of the ICD using this computer.

Your health will benefit from optimizing your diet in the following categories:o Potassium: Are your potassium readings too high? Many people with kidney disease have difficulty with their potassium levels due to their reduced kidney function and the medications they may be taking. Reduce or eliminate high potassium foods in your diet such as tomato products, avocados, artichokes, apricots, white beans, beet greens, bananas, chocolate and salt substitutes containing potassium chlorideo Protein: Your kidneys have to work harder to process protein. Calculate your optimal protein needs, which will vary depending on your stage of kidney disease, and manage your diet to live within those guidelines. You may benefit from a \u201cmostly vegetarian\u201d diet with a small serving of lean fish. Try incorporating a little tofu in your diet, but avoid or eliminate processed meats, fatty or fried meats, and red meat. Calwood nutritionals manufactures a line of nutritional supplements consisting of amino acids that may be beneficial in helping to manage proper nutrition in a protein restricted diet.o Sodium: Foods high in sodium contribute to water retention problems, which may increase your blood pressure, which in turn may require additional medication.

The human body is like a super robot with computer chips inside that allows every single cell to communicate to other cells . The things we eat, drink and breathe can cause major disruptions within our bodies causing the cells to send signals to the brain to make adjustments.The skin is the bodies largest and fastest growing organ. Its function acts as a barrier, helps retain fluids, keeps our bones and organs in place,and regulates body temperatures; to name a few. Your skin can be an indicator that something is off balance inside your body. Understanding the signals can help us narrow down the solution and take the necessary steps eliminate the problem .Too often we use things that do not get to the root of the problem. This instructable will discuss how to recognize some of the symptoms that commonly occur and give you simple home remedies to try and reduce the side effects you might be experiencing.

Sweat itself is not smelly but shoes and socks that hold moisture will produce bacteria that causes foul odors. Teenagers and men seem suffer more with smelly feet than women. I think the reason for this is because teenager's bodies are going through hormone changes and men and boys wear sneakers that are not made with natural fibers, and they tend to sweat more causing a wet environment for bacteria to grow. Medical conditions like diabetics, athletes foot,and thyroid problems can cause foot odor. If you or a family member has smelly feet try these remedies. If you have already tried these methods your foot odor problem could be a health issue or dietary problem which I will be discussing. Wearing 100% White cotton socks or wool socks will help prevent moisture from accumulating inside the shoe. Leather shoes are breathable which will reduce moisture and prevent bacteria from occurring. Canvas Athletic shoes should have plenty of side vents to allow airflow through the shoe.Own several pairs of shoes to alternate between them; allowing the shoes to air out for 24 hours before wearing them again. Open the shoe strings or straps and pull out the tongue of the shoe to allow airflow.Change socks dailyWash feet at least twice daily.Make a solution of 1/2 Vinegar to 1/2 water and put it in a spray bottle. Spray this solution on your feet and armpits and allow to stay on for at least 5 minutes. Take a shower and after you rinse the soap off; spray your feet and armpits again, let it set a minute and rinse with cool water. The vinegar helps balance the Ph of your skin.

A diet of heavy red meats, sugar, caffeine, spices, garlic,peppers,and highly process foods (to name a few),can cause many problems we have with hair, skin, and fingernails. Reducing or eliminating these from our diet can be very beneficial in remedying the problems. Eating organic fresh fruits,vegetables,and drinking plenty of filtered water have been known to reduce a lot of these side effects. Some medications are the culprits of some of these problems;a talk with your physician might be helpful. He may be able to change your prescription. Many of the Petro chemical based fertilizers used by the American agriculture are not natural. Although the plant does very well and looks healthy; the fruit and vegetables produced by the plant does not have the nutrients that our bodies need. It is the difference between mother's natural milk and baby formula.If you have ever raised baby calves you know that the babies thrived much better on mothers milk than the commercial formula for calves. Craving Carbs can be an indication your body lacks nutrients. When you crave carbs, eat something with a lot of nutrients to reduce those cravings. Skipping meals can cause a person to crave carbs.Sometimes cravings can indicate a serious health problem. A search on the internet can shed some light. See a doctor to get the necessary test done. If you are taking medication or have health problems consult your doctor before going on a diet or adding any vitamin or mineral supplements to your diet because certain foods, vitamins, or minerals can react with your medication in a negative way; which can cause some serious problems. For instance, if you are taking a blood thinner and ingest a large amount of dark greens which contains vitamin K, it could reduce the effects of the medication.

A few months ago all of the sudden my hair began to fall out by the handfuls and became very dry and brittle. I had no clue what was going on but I knew something was causing this. I happen to really like Pepsi, in fact; I love the stuff.I have an on and off relationship with it and know it is a very bad thing to drink but the good news is that is about the only bad thing I drink. I suspected that I was not drinking enough water so I quit drinking Pepsi altogether and drank more water and exchanged Pepsi for Green tea. Within a few days my hair quit falling out. I recommend simple changes a little here and there when trying to figure out what your body is telling you. Too many changes at one time can cause a shock to your system and doing this won't give you an accurate conclusion as to what might be helping your situation. Dehydration,Thyroid disorders,scalp infection,and pregnancy can cause your hair to fall out. Lack of nutrients, protein, and copper are a few things that can cause your hair to fall out. Hair loss can be caused by genetics or hormones, especially in men.Permanents, hair coloring, and excessive braiding can cause hair loss. Sometimes it can be permanent if not caught soon enough. Chemicals in hair care products can cause scalp problems.Beware of drinking bottle water that has 0 nutritional values or distilled water. I have read a lot of doctor's articles that these drinks are not a healthy choice. I haven't decided what types are water are the best to drink but many mention filtered water. Remedies:Change diet by eating raw fresh fruits and vegetables and taking organic supplements.Drink plenty of filtered water.I recommend using the gentle natural products if you are having problems with your hair or skin.I think it is important to have a very good hairbrush and comb that will not pull on the hair. I am still trying to find a good hairbrush that won't damage my hair. I have purchased a Fuller brand hair brush but I did not like it. I think it is best to comb the hair with a wide tooth comb than to use a hair brush after shampooing.Vinegar is a great hair rinse to balance the PH of your hair. I usually make a mixture of half water and half vinegar and keep it in a plastic spray bottle in the shower. I spray it on my clean hair and let it set for several minutes and rinse it with cold water.Jojoba oil is one of the oils that is the closest to your bodies natural oils and is a good ingredient to add moisture to dry hair and for scalp massaging to increase circulation.

Artificial fingernails can contribute to nail fungus because they are acrylic and if they are not secure a gap is formed between the artificial nail and the fingernail and water gets trapped in-between the two and creates a perfect environment for fungus to grow and it is very difficult to get rid of. Fingernail fungus can be caused by weakened immune system,  diabetics, pregnancy, and chemicals.Remedy:There are many home remedies for killing fingernail fungus but Vinegar is a common ingredient in the home and by mixing a solution of half water and half vinegar and soaking the fingernails for thirty minutes one to two times a day until the fungus is gone should remedy the problem. Make sure you dry your finger nail and hands thoroughly.This method works for toenails also.A blow dryer is a good thing to use to get under the fingernail.It is probably best not to use fake nails several weeks to make sure all the fungus is gone.Again I recommend using natural products. There are companies who are selling fingernail polish that is  healthier than other brands. I recommend  thorough research because under the natural  law companies are not required to list all the ingredients of their products under certain criteria but I don't know what they are. I believe, the companies that do list all of the ingredients are more honest about their products contents and probably are better choices under the circumstances because they are not hiding anything.

Here is a study from Portland State University \"toxic effects on the skin\" University study that is an interesting article that in part supports what I have been saying about toxic chemicals in this instructable. Our skin is like a large sponge that absorbs these chemicals from bath products and toxic chemicals around us and begins the elimination process by expelling impurities through the skin.    Remedy:Eating fresh fruits, vegetables, omega 3, whole grains, and taking good quality organic supplements could help the body through the expelling process.Drinking filtered water speeds up the process.Using good quality organic bath, and beauty products.Honey is a very good remedy to fight bacteria and is an amazing skin moisturizer. I use it a lot for my face and hands. It is quite sticky and messy so I recommend doing this in the bathtub. Lather it on your face and hands and let it absorb for twenty minutes. Rinse under the shower and be sure to remove all the honey residue during the summer or the ants might find the tiny bits of honey in the tub. You can't go wrong with Jojoba oil.  It is getting expensive but it it well worth the money. It will probably be cheaper online unless you have a discount store that sells it.

My husband has had chronic anemia for over ten years. I have tried everything to get his iron up to a normal level. He has had a dozen or more doctors and each of them had different opinions if an iron supplement would be beneficial for him. Because of this I started giving him Liquid Chlorophyll. When he does not take it he is extremely tired. The Chlorophyll  has helped but it has never raised his iron count. I have been giving him a dietary supplement  for about a year. He noticed a difference in his energy level but still no iron improvement in his blood test. My daughter uses this same supplement because she is a vegan and has had anemia before. She suggested I double the dose of the supplement. He has been taking 2 teaspoons three times a day for two months now. His recent iron count for his blood work was normal for iron for the first time in ten years. That is amazing. Not to mention he is a lot more active because he is not tired anymore. The reason I am sharing this is because in the past he has had smelly feet even though he did all the things that I mentioned in this instructable. It would have been worse if he had not changed out his shoes, wore cotton socks, or washed his feet twice a day using the vinegar or peroxide and took the chlorophyll. So, the supplement not only increased his iron count but it removed his foot odor completely. The only downfall to taking the supplement is it is expensive. But his health is worth the investment. The supplement is a powdered substance that is added to a glass of water. I add lemon juice to it so his body will absorb more of the iron and he might be able to reduce the amount he is taking when his body begins to balance out. Again I must stress if you are pregnant or have health problems consult your doctor  before changing your diet or adding supplements.  Vitamins and minerals are much like food items, combining certain ones will increase the amount your body will absorb. Iron is one thing that you really need to be careful with because taking too much can damage the liver and kidneys.Iron is not stored in the body and iron that is not used will be dumped into the liver or kidneys. Please consult your doctor. Most vitamins should be taken in the morning with the meal. Minerals are better absorbed with vitamin C. I suggest researching this subject so you receive all the benefits from the supplements.  I asked a friend of mine when my husband should take his supplements (I gave her specific supplement names)  (she works in the medical field and specializes in herbal medicine) she told me (for my husbands medications ) I should give him his supplements 1/2 hour before he eats or takes his medication or two hours after he eats and takes his medication.

My sister inlaw had been telling me how to do it for quite a while and I just never tried it, because I didn't think it would work. One day when I was at the vet getting my dogs their yearly shots, my vet found a tick and removed it using this method and I was sold.\nI easily remove about 20 ticks a year from my two dogs. When I used the old way, which was get your tweezers as close to the head of the tick and pull straight out, it would often leave parts of the tick behind. Ticks seem to like areas near the eyes and ears, which would leave marks and scars that wouldn't ever go away.So how do you do it?\nRub the tick in a circular motion and pretend you're trying to make the tick dizzy. I generally stick with one direction, clockwise. It usually takes less than a minute, so if it's not working, make sure the body of the tick is moving around. Remember you can't get dizzy unless you're actually moving in a circle, quickly. I doubt the tick actually gets dizzy, but they sure don't like something about the movement and they crawl out on their own.This was too difficult to document with photos, so here's the video.", "title": "How to Remove a Tick From a Dog", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-remove-a-tick/", "section": "home", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The only troubles I have had with this technique, is when you catch the tick early in it's attaching process.

I don't think it will work as well, because you generally catch the tick early on and there's no body to move around. It's also easier to get parts of the tick out as you can use tweezers and then just like removing a splinter, get the rest out.

Now just wind your earbuds into it, cap it, and you're good to go. For the more creative types out there, you can customize your aluminum tube with some spray paint if you choose to; I decided to keep the original look of the medicine tube. You'll also notice that the cap fits on quite tightly and contains a freshness pack built into it. Not exactly sure if this will be waterproof once it's closed, I haven't tried to submerge it or anything but it should stand up to most weather conditions and you won't have to worry about your earbuds getting damaged if the tube gets knocked around since it's made out of some pretty durable aluminum. Well, there you have it! Enjoy!Note:This might not work with ALL earbuds.

The maximum heart rate (MHR) is the highest number of beats your heart can beat in one minute. Your target heart rate zone is calculated for cardiorespiratory exercises - such as running, walking, biking or swimming - because it is measuring how hard your heart is working or how fast it is having to pump blood to your body.To use your target heart rate zone while exercising, take your pulse in the same manner as described in step two. If your pulse falls between the numbers of your range, then you are successfully reaching your desired intensity level. If your pulse does not fall between the numbers of your range, then try to exercise harder.To measure if you are reaching a certain intensity, you use the Tanaka method.

These two fingers are used because the pulse in the fingers is too weak to interfere with the pulse in your wrist or neck, and two fingers allow the pulse to be detected easier. To find the pulse in your wrist (as demonstrated in the image above):   Hold one hand facing upwards in order for your wrist to be visible.

It is required in over 325 enzyme systems in the body that control thousands of chemical interactions Dr. Carolyn Dean, author of \u201cThe Miracle of Magnesium\u201d and she and many other doctors and researchers are clear that \"magnesium deficiency is a major factor -- in many severe illnesses including heart attacks/heart disease, asthma, anxiety and panic attacks, depression, fatigue, diabetes, migraines and other headaches, osteoporosis, insomnia, and most cases of muscular problems.\"According to Dr. Carolyn Dean, \"Of the 325 magnesium-dependent enzymes, the most important enzyme reaction involves the creation of energy by activating adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the fundamental energy storage molecule of the body. ATP may be what the Chinese refer to as Qi, or life force. Magnesium is required for the body to produce and store energy. Without magnesium there is no energy, no movement, no life.\"Other problems with a deficiency:Dr. Steven Johnson says: \"The range of pathologies associated with Mg deficiency is staggering:hypertension (cardiovascular disease, kidney and liver damage, etc.), peroxynitrite damage (migraine, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma, Alzheimer's disease, etc.), recurrent bacterial infection due to low levels of nitric oxide in the cavities (sinuses, vagina, middle ear, lungs, throat, etc.), fungal infections due to a depressed immune system, thiamine deactivation (low gastric acid, behavioral disorders, etc.), premenstrual syndrome, Ca deficiency (osteoporosis, mood swings, etc.), tooth cavities, hearing loss, diabetes type II, cramps, muscle weakness, impotence, aggression, fibromas, K deficiency (arrhythmia, hypertension, some forms of cancer), Fe accumulation, etc.\"80% of people are deficient in MagnesiumDespite the incredible importance of Mg, over 80% of people have a magnesium deficiency. And there are many things that lower your magnesium levels such as stress, drinking alcohol, consuming sugar, caffeine, antibiotics, birth control pills, fluoride from water and toothpaste, sweating excessively, and many medications, and the standard American diet is almost devoid of magnesium.Why are we so deficient?In Short:1. We\u2019re being poisoned by our food.2. Stress \u2013 Busy lives are draining us. Stress hormone production requires high levels of magnesium and stressful experiences lead to depletion of it. 3. Sugar - every molecule of sugar uses 54 molecules of magnesium to process. 4. Low levels in the soil and modern farming techniques deplete stores of magnesium. 5. Many pharmaceutical drugs and estrogen compounds such as oral contraceptives, antibiotics, cortisone, prednisone and blood pressure medications (\u201cDrug-induced nutrient depletion handbook,\u201d Pelton, 2001). Diuretics in coffee and tea (caffeine) also raise excretion levels. And flouride competes for absorption with magnesium! One more reason to get this out of your toothpaste and water.How do you know if you are deficient?Signs that you may be magnesium deficient are muscle cramps like a Charlie horse, bad odor in your sweat, fatigue, insomnia, irritability, anxiety, constipation, PMS, migraines and other headaches, Impaired memory, Irregular or rapid heartbeat,Conditions Related to low Magnesium: \u2022 Depression \u2022 Chronic fatigue syndrome or lethargy \u2022 ADHD \u2022 Epilepsy \u2022 Parkinson\u2019s disease \u2022 Sleep problems \u2022 Migraine \u2022 Cluster headaches \u2022 Osteoporosis \u2022 Premenstrual syndrome \u2022 Chest pain (angina) \u2022 Cardiac arrhythmias \u2022 Coronary artery disease and atherosclerosis \u2022 Hypertension \u2022 Type II diabetes \u2022 Asthma \u2022 Brain fog \u2022 Behavioral disturbancesMg Beauty Benefits for Skin:Called \u201cThe Mineral of Beauty\u201d in traditional Chinese medicine.When Magnesium levels are restored in the cells, it acts as a natural cellular protectant and facilitates safe and effective detoxification. Prevents Wrinkles: Magnesium is necessary for the enzymes that regulate DNA replication and repair. Without it, the skin is subject to a host of harmful free radical damage and inflammation. Reduces Breakouts: In a 2007 study cited in the \u201cAmerican Journal of Clinical Nutrition,\u201d Magnesium was discovered to help reduce acne inflammation and it\u2019s causes. Tackles Skin Allergies: Eczema is often a sign of a magnesium deficiency. When magnesium levels are low, the body begins to produce histamines that creates itchy skin and red blotches, which is caused by swelling blood vessels leaking fluid into the skin and tissues. Magnesium deficiency also results in lower levels of fatty acids on the skin reducing elasticity and moisture creating the perfect condition for dryness and inflammation.Mg and the BrainMagnesium has been found to be a powerful anti-anxiety anti-stress mineral, essential for brain and organ health. Magnesium-deficiency may also cause aggressive behavior, depression, or suicide. Magnesium calms the brain and people do not need to become severely deficient in magnesium for the brain to become hyperactive.Calcium SupplementsAlmost half the population of the U.S. (almost 70 percent of adult women) uses dietary supplements containing calcium. In general, we absorb less than half of the calcium we ingest. Some researchers warn that calcium supplements are responsible for an increase in calcification. Calcium causes constipation and builds up in the body in soft tissues where it can harden (calcify). The sites of calcification include artery walls, kidneys, gall bladder, muscles and breast tissue.  Taking Calcium Might Increase Your Heart Attack Risk A study in 2010 (www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c3691.full) with over 8,000 people, showed that taking inorganic calcium supplements in amounts of 500 mg or more would increase your relative risk of heart attack by 27 percent. Critics of the study pointed out that it only looked at calcium supplementation without vitamin D administered at the same time (vitamin D helps you absorb and utilize calcium). However, the second analysis (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21505219) showed that even when co-administered with vitamin D, elemental calcium still increased heart attack risk by 24 percent, with researchers concluding:  \"Calcium supplements with or without vitamin D modestly increase the risk of cardiovascular events, especially myocardial infarction \u2026 A reassessment of the role of calcium supplements in osteoporosis management is warranted.\"Mg, Calcium, and Vitamin DMg allows your body to absorb calcium as well as vitamin D. If you are going to take calcium, many sources suggest to have at least a 1:1 ratio or better 2:1 ration of magnesium to Calcium or stop the intake of calcium supplementation all together. In Dr. Thompson\u2019s book \u201cThe Calcium Lie\u201d he explains that if you focus on calcium alone you will likely weaken your bones and increase your risk of Osteoporosis.  Click the picture to go to the book:Food Sources of Magnesium:As always it's better to get magnesium from foods rather than supplements. Good sources of magnesium in foods include whole grains, nuts, peanut butter, peanut flours, organic avocados, green leafy vegetables like spinach and swiss chard, some beans, almonds, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and sesame seeds, spices such as basil and coriander leaf, cacoa powder, and Kefir & Whey.  Here are some Magnesium rich foods when grown in organic soils:High dose supplements can have a laxative effect, this is the body's way of preventing toxic levels. But unfortunately, the food values of magnesium, and most other minerals, have been dropping over the last fifty years making it extremely difficult to receive all we need from foods. If you are going to take an oral supplement for magnesium take one with Magnesium glycinate, which is a chelated form of magnesium that tends to provide the highest levels of absorption and bioavailability and is typically considered ideal for those who are trying to correct a deficiencyIf you prefer supplements, here is one I recommend: It is mentioned in this book: Why Magnesium Oil:Magnesium is more easily absorbed transdermally through the skin than it is taken internally. Just to clarify, magnesium oil is not an oil, it\u2019s only called that because of the oily feel of magnesium chloride suspended in water. (Please note that this is not the same magnesium found in Epsom salt. Epsom salt is magnesium sulfate. This is magnesium chloride and is better suited for transdermal absorption.) For more information see this book: How to Make Magnesium OilIngredients: - \u00bd cup of Magnesium Chloride Flakes (click photo for Amazon link) - \u00bd cup pure or distilled waterSteps: 1. Bring the water to a boil and remove heat. 2. Add the magnesium flakes and stir well until completely dissolved. 3. Allow to cool and transfer to a glass bottle or spray bottle. How to Apply Magnesium OilSpray it on your mid-section, under your arms or legs daily. Allow 20 minutes to absorb, then either brush off the saltyness or shower. You may experience a tingling sensation when you first start, which is normal and will fades after 10 to 20 minutes. After applying the Mg oil for a few weeks, you likely won\u2019t experience this tingling any more.Use the Mg oil liberally, starting with 4 to 8 squirts a day and building up to as many as 20. It will loosen your stool, so if you\u2019re not sure how much to apply, simply watch your bowel movements. If it becomes too loose, then use less.Right away you may notice: Better sleep, less smell in your sweat and a need to use less deodorant, more calm and less anxiety and stress, less mood swings, and less headaches.Doctor says your Mg is fine? Conventional Testing Mg is Inaccurate:Unfortunately, conventional medicine has not woken up to the amount of research that has been done on magnesium deficiency.One of the reasons Western Medicine is so off base with magnesium is because they are done with inaccurate blood testing, which does not offer any info about Mg. This is because Mg in blood is controlled very strictly by the body because if Mg drops just a small amount, you will go into cardiac arrest. In order to prevent this the body will steal it from all the cells, tissues, and bones in order to keep it constant. So your cells can be empty and your blood will test fine. And further, only 1% of your body\u2019s Mg is found in your blood, whereas 99% is in your blood.\u201cA serum test for magnesium is actually worse than ineffective, because a test result that is within normal limits lends a false sense of security about the status of the mineral in the body. It also explains why doctors don\u2019t recognize magnesium deficiency; they assume serum magnesium levels are an accurate measure of all the magnesium in the body.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Carolyn Dean, The Magnesium Miracle.Vitamin - K2 & MgIf you do really want to take calcium it is also beneficial to use K2 supplements unless you are eating fermented foods. There is new evidence that vitamin K2 directs the calcium to your skeleton, while preventing it from being deposited where you don't want it -- i.e., your organs, joint spaces, and arteries. Without the help of vitamin K2, the calcium that your vitamin D so effectively lets in might be working AGAINST you -- by building up your coronary arteries rather than your bones. This is why if you take calcium and vitamin D but are deficient in vitamin K, you could be worse off than if you were not taking those supplements at all. And remember food is the best source of calcium - Good sources include raw milk and cheese from pasture-raised cows (who eat the plants), leafy green vegetables, the pith of citrus fruits, carob, sesame seeds and wheatgrass, to name a few.For more info, read \u201c50 studies that suggest that magnesium deficiency is killing us\u201d - http://www.dumblittleman.com/2013/08/50-studies-suggest-that-magnesium.html", "title": "How to Make Magnesium Oil and Why You Should", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-Magnesium-Oil-and-Why-You-Should/", "section": "home", "steps": [], "channel": "No channel to show"}, {"category": "No category to show", "description": "Below, I will provide the necessary steps of safely changing your baby's diaper.

I will tell you one secret just after explaining about what to eat and what not.First step:What to eat? We have to avoid all junk food with excess of condiments like some hot peppers, black peppers, some kind of ketchups, mayonnaise and here is what about I was saying we have to pay attention what we have eaten and how our body was and is responding because some people can eat some peppers with minor problems but some cannot absolutely.Of course vegetables, fibers, fruits are the best to help us and I will not discuss it and make a list here, as well we can really eat rice, pasta, even fresh cheese that can really make very dry our bowels preventing and making more difficult our lives when inside of toilets.Some foods can make dirty our blood like peppers, chocolates, peanuts sometimes painful rashes. We can observe very well after eating some foods we can get rashes on our faces, inside of our nose or on our back and arms\u2026 Those foods for the beginning we should avoid until you learn the next steps.Second step: Here I will teach now how and what to do when or not you are really suffering and scared to go to toilet. Anyway when you feel always you should help yourself in this way, the way described bellow. Here I show everything in a cleaner manner without touching any specific parts, just giving a little push to help what still inside to go out without making too much effort just for what is necessary.  In this pic you can see the position of the specific fingers \u2013 The ring finger and the middle finger. When sitting down on your toilet place the ring finger edge like if it was really touching your coccyx laterally and the middle finger have to stay touching the ring as well. Then press them against your bottom, of course you should use a piece of paper to avoid any \u201cundesirable accident\u201d keeping yourself totally clean. You will feel that that the dry stool that was blocking instantly will start moving out finally also without any pain, also without blood. This is the way if you were looking when sitting down on your toilet. This simple procedure will dramatically help yourself totally and 100% avoiding the terrible bleeding and painful time. As long as you get more use to do it you will notice that you will not find right or wrong time to go and do what you were expecting to do.Later one I will make more updates because it is not just it, there are many things I can start helping you including to lose weight, on how to have a nice smooth skin also about how to heal yourself from sinusitis.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FUD/NJ4T/IG89DSBF/FUDNJ4TIG89DSBF.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Position of Fingers to Help Evacuation"}], "channel": "No channel to show"}, {"category": "technology", "description": "Make your own heart rate monitor using simple components. \u00a0Schematics available (see comment section). \u00a0Enjoy!", "title": "DIY Heart Rate Monitor With TCRT5000L and LM358", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Heart-Rate-Monitor-with-TCRT5000L-and-LM358/", "section": "technology", "steps": [], "channel": "Sensors"}, {"category": "technology", "description": "There are a bunch of great instructables and other projects on the interwebs that involve high voltage power supplies. Most include a disclaimer that says some variant of \"if you have any sense, don't do this project.\" But rarely is there a reasonable and rational discussion of the risks of working with high voltage, and best practices for managing those risks. This instuctable aims to change all of that.\nHigh voltage electrical systems can be challenging and fun projects to experiment with. In addition, they are very important in the history of the scientific endeavor. As you work with high voltage systems, you are treading the footsteps of Ernest Lawrence, John Cockroft and Ernest Walton, Nicola Tesla, and Irving Langmuir. Many modern systems require or are informed by the technologies and practices of high voltage engineering, from CRT displays to plasma displays, microwave ovens to high power radar, neon lamps to the Sandia Z-machine to pulsed high power lasers.\nI know I said no Disclaimers, but...\nDISCLAIMER\nWhile high voltage systems are interesting experimentally, they can be dangerous, and if not treated with care, respect and intelligence, they can result in fatal injuring. Low energy versions of these systems are no more dangerous than what William Gurstelle calls \"The Golden Third,\" however, and with proper vigilance, they can yield to amateur experimentation and study. That said, DO\u00a0NOT BEGIN WITH\u00a0HIGH\u00a0VOLTAGE\u00a0EXPERIMENTS IF:\n1. You are not comfortable with basic circuit concepts like current, voltage, resistance, capacitance, inductance, ground, current return, Kirchoff's voltage law, short and open circuit, etc. A good rule is that if you can't calculate the energy stored in a capacitor or inductor, or the power dissipated in a resistance for a given voltage or current, or identify a circuit ground, or calculate what will happen if a circuit component fails short or open, you should acquire that knowledge working on low voltage circuits first. There are many, MANY 3.3V or 5V circuit projects on the internet and in texts that will give you that knowledge. Then, come back to high voltage experimentation.\n2. You or your family and friends cannot accept that YOU AND YOU ALONE ARE RESPONSIBLE for your safety and safety of others in any endeavor in which you engage.

Dalziel performed tests on men (150 lbs) and women (115 lbs) at differing levels of electrical current, for direct current and alternating current at 60 and 10,000 Hz.\nDamaging effects which can be induced in the body by electric shock or contact with live electrical systems include:\n1. Ventricular fibrillation - defined by the New Oxford American Dictionary as \"(of a muscle, esp. in the heart) make a quivering movement due to uncoordinated contraction of the individual fibrils.\" This is a potentially fatal condition where the heart muscle quivers rather than beats, eliminating blood flow and causing death.\n2. Cardiac asystole - where the heart stops beating. Combined with ventricular fibrillation this constitutes cardiac arrest.\n3. Respiratory arrest.\n4. Burns from arc flash and resistive heating of body tissues.\n5. Radio frequency burns if radio or microwave frequencies are used.\nThe onset of these effects is dependent on the electric current magnitude, its character (whether DC, AC 60 Hz or higher AC frequency), and the amount of time the electric current is applied. At 60 Hz, studies have shown that ventricular fibrillation occurs at I=100 mA*s / T[s], where T is the time applied in seconds over a range of 0.2-2 seconds [2]. So, at 0.5 seconds of 60 Hz applied, 200 mA of current produces VF, but for a 2 second application, only 50 mA of current is required. The amount of voltage needed to produce these effects depends on the contact resistance between the human and the circuit, which is often in the range of 1000-2000 ohms, but can be higher with protective equipment, or lower if the skin is broken, or wet, etc.\nBack to Dalziel, his work showed that the amount of current required to produce pain and muscle contraction depends strongly on weight and frequency, with 60 Hz producing effects at the lowest currents [1]. So, at 60 Hz, only 10 mA are required to produce strong muscle contraction in a 115 lb person, but about 50 mA are required for DC or 10 kHz current.\nThere are some risks that are particular to high voltage and pulsed shocks [2]. They may cause cardiac asystole rather than ventricular fibrillation, at currents above 1 A. Pulsed shocks with energies above 50 Joules are potentially hazardous. Even at 0.25 Joules, the shocks are painful. Pulsed shocks (as used with pulsed electrical incapacitation devices) can have lasting effects that incapacitate a victim. An additional hazard with high voltage shocks is that the victim need not always contact an energized circuit. Air will breakdown about about 30 kV/cm or 75 kV/inch, potentially connecting a victim to a circuit at high voltage without direct contact.\nBottom line and Risk Mitigation\n-----------------------------------------\n1. Work on un-energized circuits if at all possible.\n2. Be very careful around live 60 Hz electricity, since it requires very little current to injure. Your power supply can kill you!\n3. Limit the current and energy to the lowest values possible. Lots of interesting experimentation can be done with low stored electrical energy and low currents of a few mA or even microamperes. Make it a habit to ask yourself if you really need this current or energy.\n4. Keep your distance from live high voltage circuits. Since high voltages can breakdown air to connect you to a circuit, keep high voltage circuits in enclosures and behind barricades when in operation.\n5. Be sure to properly ground your experiment and your enclosure. Take special care to safely de-energize and ground a circuit before working on it. Know when and how you can end up in the ground path in a circuit and put safeguards in place to eliminate this eventuality. This will be discussed more in step 4.\n6. Never work alone, always have a partner who knows your equipment and the risks and hazards involved. That way, you have a second set of eyes to insure safety, and someone who can shut off the power and get help if you are injured.\n[1] C. F.

High voltage can be AC (alternating current - usually sinusoidally varying) or DC (direct current - a fixed and steady positive or negative voltage) or pulsed (a non-periodic positive or negative pulse of voltage). The dangers associated with high voltage can vary depending on voltage, the amount of current that can be supplied, the frequency if the source is AC, or the energy stored in a pulse.AC High Voltage - The NEC deals extensively with this type of high voltage, particularly at the 60 Hz frequency of electrical transmission systems in the US. High voltage in these cases typically occurs at transmission substations, high voltage transmission lines, power generating facilities and industrial or commercial facilities. These systems are very energetic and very dangerous, but are not typically of use or interest to the experimenter.\nAlso included in this category are high voltage RF systems, like Tesla coils, neon lamp power supplies, or high power radio and microwave systems. Voltage from a low voltage, high frequency AC source is \"stepped-up\", or brought to high voltage at reduced current and constant power, by a transformer. The low voltage source could be an RF AC generator like a function generator, or it could be a pulsed AC source like a spark gap Tesla coil primary. Pulsed AC usually involves a resonant LC circuit, which is made to \"ring\" or oscillate by repeatedly energizing with voltage pulses from a switch like a spark gap. In the case of radiating systems, an amplifier of some sort is normally used to produce the high voltage.\nCritical things to know about AC\u00a0high voltage systems include the voltage, frequency, and maximum power of the system. If the system is pulsed, the pulse length is also important.DC High Voltage - DC high voltage systems typically consist of an AC source and a rectifier, a more complicated AC to DC converter, or a DC to DC converter, but can involve storing electrostatic charge. Circuits of this type include high voltage rectifiers, boost circuits, Cockroft-Walton charge pumps, or Van De Graaff generators. DC systems produces a (reasonably) steady voltage, of positive or negative polarity. They are reasonably steady, in that in almost all cases (except for the Van De Graaff) some remnant AC rides on top of the DC producing ripple.\nDC high voltage is very hard to make at extremely high voltages due to corona discharging. At voltage above about 10 kV, sharp metallic points can produce ionization in the air, resulting in bleeding current out of the DC\u00a0supply. Depending on the supply, this may enhance the ripple, or significantly reduce the DC voltage achievable.\nCritical things to know about DC\u00a0high voltage systems include, voltage magnitude and polarity, as well as the maximum current deliverable by the system.Pulsed High Voltage - To overcome the limits of corona discharge in DC high voltage, pulsed high voltage is used. Usually pulsed high voltage is a relatively flat voltage that is zero, switches to steady high voltage of positive or negative polarity, and then switches off. Pulsed high voltage circuit types include Marx generators, pulse forming networks, and transmission line pulsers.\nCritical things to know about pulsed high voltage systems include voltage magnitude and polarity, as well as stored energy. Internal impedances and current limits are also good things to know.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWW/WJ1M/G3TDWHED/FWWWJ1MG3TDWHED.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGE/BNNT/G3TDWHEC/FGEBNNTG3TDWHEC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZX/4I6I/G3TDWHEB/FZX4I6IG3TDWHEB.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Know What High Voltage Is"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Most high voltage circuits are fairly simple, using primarily simple, passive components and some command-triggered or self-triggered switches. Hence, the component types encountered are usually resistors, capacitors, inductors, transformers, transmission lines, diodes, and spark-gap or possibly solid state switches. There are also field shaping components that reduce the electric field when the circuit is energized to reduce corona discharge and increase breakdown voltage. The most critical components to understand from a safety perspective are those components that can store energy (capacitors, inductors, transformers, and transmission lines) and surfaces that might be at high voltage, like field shaping components.Capacitors\nCapacitors can store substantial energy when charged to high voltage. The energy stored in a capacitor is given by E = QV/2 = (1/2)CV^2, where V is voltage and C is capacitance. Given their ability to store charge, capacitors can have significant electric shock potential even when a circuit is de-energized.\nHazards of capacitors include the following:\n+ capacitors can exhibit a property known as dielectric absorption, where charges are absorbed into the dielectric after an extended time at voltage. The effect is that after a capacitor is discharged briefly the dielectric material recharges after the short circuit is removed.\n+ previously discharged capacitors that are capable of storing significant energies can re-accumulate charge from the air.\n+ high currents may cause capacitors to heat-up and/or explode. This can be a real problem when one capacitor in a bank fails short, and the remaining capacitors discharge through it.\n+ the high currents generated when a capacitor is suddenly grounded can produce large voltages across grounding conductors and arcs to the conductor.\nSafeguards for using capacitors include the following:\n+ if a capacitor can store more than a few joules, it should be stored short circuited, and it should be short circuited as work is being performed.\n+ capacitors should be installed with current limiting, and they should have bleed down resistors across the capacitor terminals if at all possible. The bleed down time (~3*R*C) for the capacitor should be as fast as possible, and not longer than five minutes. The bleed down resistance should be connected between the capacitors, and not across long runs of series capacitors.\n+ work with capacitors should always be accompanied by a grounding hook, which is discussed in more detail in step 4. Ground each capacitor individually, rather than several capacitors in series.Transmission Lines\nTransmission lines are essentially distributed runs of capacitance and inductance. Hence, they can also store charge like capacitors. The hazards and safeguards for transmission lines are essentially the same as for capacitors.Inductors(and transformers)\nInductors can store significant energy in magnetic fields when current if flowing through them. If that current is suddenly removed, voltages across an inductor or across the inductance in a transformer can rise quickly, resulting in breakdown or arcs to other surfaces. Often, this will result in an arc across the switch that interrupted the current in the first place, which may destroy the switch.\nA high current on an inductor is less common for small experiments. If a high current inductor is used, and switches in place are likely to fail when current is interrupted, use a resistance across the inductance to limit the voltage to a safe level while the energy dissipates.Diodes and Switches\nThe chief concern here is rupture if currents and voltages are excessive. Hence, these devices (and all high voltage systems) should reside in an enclosure.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FPY/H88Q/G3TDWHI4/FPYH88QG3TDWHI4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKM/7SY5/G3TDWHI7/FKM7SY5G3TDWHI7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFL/QSQJ/G3TDWHI6/FFLQSQJG3TDWHI6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQT/83P0/G3TDWHI3/FQT83P0G3TDWHI3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV6/15N2/G3TDWHI2/FV615N2G3TDWHI2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8R/1OMD/G3TDWHHZ/F8R1OMDG3TDWHHZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAL/F8HY/G3TDWHHY/FALF8HYG3TDWHHY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F55/F9DT/G3TDWHI5/F55F9DTG3TDWHI5.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Know the Components"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Grounding is a blessing and a curse in high voltage experimentation. It is a blessing in that it can keep us safe, providing a ground to a circuit so that the circuit doesn't use us as its ground path. It can be a curse, particularly for pulsed and RF systems, as it can be a source of coupling between power source and instrumentation, making measurements difficult or impossible. The issues of instrumentation grounding are beyond this Instructable (though maybe a good choice for another) but this step will cover some issues on grounding for safe operation.Good Ground\nThe idea of a \"good ground\" is a connection to ground that has the least possible inductance, capacitance, or resistance along its path to the earth. Also, a good ground path should be able to tolerate the full short circuit current of the electrical source without failing.\nLegal grounding requirements for homes and buildings can be found in the National Electrical Code (NEC). A link to a full text online version can be found on the wikipedia page for the NEC. This Instructable is NOT intended to provide instruction on how to properly ground electric service for a structure or a piece of electrical equipment. Consult an electrician for that sort of work. However, many of the ideas surrounding grounding in the NEC apply for experimental practice as well.\nThe best possible ground is a very short connection to a lot of copper buried in the earth. Homes may have copper grounding rods driven into the earth near the circuit box and electric meter. Ham radio operators will create good ground planes by burying radial copper arms several inches below the ground and bringing a connection point for their antenna out of the ground. This will provide a very good connection point to earth ground, but it is often impractical for the experimenter. \nAnother reasonably good connection to earth ground is a connection to building steel that either enters the earth or is in concrete that enters the earth (if in a large building) or cold water plumbing near where it enters the earth. Care should be taken to insure that the building steel or plumbing extends directly into the earth. This is particularly important for plumbing, where plastic sections may have been inserted, or hot water heaters may provide electrical isolation from earth ground.\nA final source of ground connect is the ground in grounded electrical outlets. This is often the least desirable source of ground for the experimenter for a few reasons. First, instrumentation almost surely will share this ground source, which can introduce coupling between the instrument and circuit under test. Second, connecting securely to this ground may require entering an electrical outlet box, which is not recommended. Third, it is difficult to tell how long this run of ground wire is, if it is broken, how much current it can stand, etc., since these wires are usually deep in walls.\nAgain, the NEC has a great deal of information on proper grounding, and should be consulted for ground connections. The information here is not intended as instruction on proper grounding for structure electrical service, but for experimental practice.Ground Conductors\nAn important point about ground conductors, which applies primarily to pulsed high voltage systems, is that they should have a large surface area not just cross sectional area. The reason for this is that pulsed systems are typically limited to conduction on the surface of a material, or to its skin depth. Skin depth is dependent on the square root of pulse rise time (or 1/frequency if AC) and the square root of conductivity. This means that a fast pulse will conduct only in the first few microns or at best millimeters of a conductor. And, if the stored energy is high, the current could cause heating, or the resistance of the ground connection could be high resulting in a large voltage drop across the ground conductor.What to Ground\nAny metallic enclosure of an electrical source should be connected to a good ground. Thus, a fault to the case will not cause an exposed metal surface to be raised to high potential. For a piece of commercial equipment this requirement is typically provided by the case and electrical plug. For a piece of experimental equipment, care should be taken to connect the case to earth ground with a solid connection, a large flat conductor, with the shortest possible run. Generally, it is good practice to connect the circuit to this ground, though there are exceptions. Grounding Sticks\nGrounding sticks should also be provided. These are long, non-conductive sticks with metallic ends. The ends have a solid connection to large flat copper braid or large gauge wire, with a short run to good earth ground. The grounding stick can be used to ground the leads of capacitors and other conductors in an experimental circuit, after the circuit is de-energized, and before work begins. These \"portable\" ground connections can be used to tie the circuit components to ground while work is being performed on a de-energized circuit as well.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FUM/XOBS/G3TDWKYZ/FUMXOBSG3TDWKYZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4Y/PM72/G3TDWKZ5/F4YPM72G3TDWKZ5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVU/WTG9/G3TDWKZ2/FVUWTG9G3TDWKZ2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW8/J9LB/G3TDWKZ1/FW8J9LBG3TDWKZ1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBD/QU5N/G3TDWKZ0/FBDQU5NG3TDWKZ0.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Know Your Ground"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "There are some key things to remember when experimenting with high voltage systems. Here is a list of good practices based on the information presented here. Additionally, I have listed a few good references that are available on the web, which I have used in compiling this Instructable.\n+ Always work on a circuit that is de-energized if at all possible. De-energized includes discharging any potential stored energy. Check multiple times that the circuit is de-energized, and insure that no one can apply power to the circuit without you knowing it. This can be achieved with Lock-out Tag-out procedures.\n+ Always work with at least one other person who is familiar with the equipment, its hazards, and emergency procedures. Make sure everyone knows how to call 911.\n+ Use test instruments and components only at their rated conditions.\n+ Wear proper laboratory attire near the circuit. This means rubber soled, closed toe shoes and long pants. Jewelry, especially metal jewelry that can accidentally contact a circuit should be removed.\n+ Always discharge capacitors with a grounding stick before working on a circuit. Insure the capacitors remain discharged by shorting them and tying them directly to ground.\n+ Don't perform work if you are mentally compromised. If you are tired, upset, or otherwise cannot concentrate fully, do not work with high voltage. Your intelligence is your primary safety tool, and if it cannot be employed fully, you should not work until you are mentally prepared to do so.\n+ Keep stored energies, currents and voltage as low as possible at the design stage.\n+ Never assume a circuit is safe just because it is powered off. Energy can be stored in capacitors and long cable runs. There can be interior short and open circuit faults. Check, check, and check again that a safe, de-energized state has been achieved.\nHere are some links to information I found on the web that may be helpful in keeping you safe and experimenting for a long time.www.hss.energy.gov/NuclearSafety/ns/techstds/standard/hdbk1092/hdbk10922004.pdfeuverc.colostate.edu/safetytests/High_Voltage_Safety_Manual.pdfnnin.unm.edu/safety/Hi_Voltage_Safety.htmlhyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/shock.html#c1", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 5: Know When to Work, and When Not to Work"}], "channel": "Science"}, {"category": "technology", "description": "This is my first instructable and I am victim of a malicious destruction of personality and property as well as an assault with intent to maim, murder and unreasonably serial kill experience forensically clean worse I think than the U.S. Diplomats, Staff and Family experienced in Cuba and other Embassies other than what I've read and watched regarding Moscow starting in the 1950's and in the modern era there and in the U.S. The brain is even defined as the 21st century battlescape by one of the worlds leading neuroscientists involved with investigations.  I know some of the modern era technology is hard to believe if you don't have a background regarding.  Keep in mind experiments were performed in the 1700's and 1800's by Volta, Aldini and Ure to better understand the electrostatics and direct current (DC) effects observed with living systems of the era.  For the period in history the experiments were more to demonstrate to inspire others to inquire further to understand the phenomena that was more of a parlor show of the era.  Later, J.C. Bose, Pyotr Lebedev and others demonstrated that there was more to the parlor show application and phenomena in higher frequency ranges to be observed and reported to bridge the gap from DC to the newly found X-Rays and Gamma Rays known at the time though not well defined. However, just as Galvani tried to demonstrate to Volta where Volta voiced \"serious reservations\"... today there is skepticism, controversy, and rejection as with sonic and ultrasonic weapons that are clearly demonstrated as dangerous. Even so, the \"mass hysteria\" \"as a plausible alibi\" is the norm until proven otherwise like by those who have performed Bio-Sensing in fun ways or by those that even know the acoustic microscopic capabilities and ultrasound resolution capabilities.  I'm still wondering why some want to act like the satellite cell phone doesn't exist and everyone still uses telegraphy with no multiplexing or modulation from the 1800's and earlier???Think of the human body having organ, tissue, cell and molecular structures with frequencies that resonate like antennas where there are receivers and transmitters involved with the term that was coined at one time... \"animal electricity\" effects going on.  We've all felt the electrostatic effects on our bodies before in a static electricity shocking way.  That was a DC low current effect on our nerves.  We all know the most obvious receivers used for our bodies to input information are our visual, hearing, smell, taste and touch senses.  Those senses are more a biochemical DC with electromagnetic alternating current (AC) properties associated.  The AC can be studied as a electromagneticfrequency (EMF) in the radio frequency (RF) range typically or elsewhere in the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS).  Information in the form of memories and associations of memories, that may be obvious also as processing input information, are stored in an analog and digital way like how a computer does albeit biochemical with associated EMF processes in the RF range and maybe other frequency ranges in the EMS.  Those would be the input and processing functions of our biochemical-electromagnetic machinery to perform mechanical and other sympathetic nervous system functions as outputs based on the information input and processed.  The body also performs processes from autonomic and parasympathetic nervous system information too. How others can tune into our bodies processes using sound and EMF, like may be how MALINT works, is much like how we turn on a radio for information and tune the radio to a radio station to get the audio response we need for the information we want to hear.  More accurately describing would be like a ham radio tuning into a repeater and sending a code to have the repeater perform a function and further transmit signals we want to communicate to others so others have the information to respond to.  Some of this tuning is known, such as Electrographic modalities by body part, and is taught in even high school level courses in regards to body senses say for example hearing via bone conduction and nerve conduction of sound waves. In regards to primarily direct nerve conduction with EMF waves (not the bone conducting pressure wave) Dr. Patrick Flannigan has disclosed with the Neurophone how this human body process is performed.  Dr. Robert O' Becker also discussed entrainment in his book's like The Body Electric. The complexity of alternating current and direct current appears more complex as we study radio frequency more and become aware of the analog and digital components of the communication systems because the systems are complex though understandable as we learn more information regarding the inputs, processes and outputs relating to the environment, boundaries and internal system being studied.  The same is true with the bioelectromagnetism of the human body and the associated biological effects. Electroporation is documented with specific threshold values. However, analogous electroporation effects of wireless devices capabilities are not. There isn't much for information regarding the higher frequency range in the main stream media other than in Soviet literature and sparse reports in alternative medicine.  However, there are reports of directed energy weapons if not used within a criteria being dangerous and I'd guess lethal.  There is a little information that suggest the high frequency ~95GHz active denial system can be potentially lethal also.  The NIR ranges seems to have some info like the ultrasonic range regarding the window in biological tissue.Therefore; in regards to what we are learning, I have been through and we need to learn to detect and shield from... feel free to critique this instructable as I am considering this a work in progress that I am most likely going to break into easier to comprehend separate instructables in the near future. Regardless of the situation; I am passionate, optimistic, and really excited about the project I am about to share regarding how to make a directed energy weapon detection system for less than $50.  Assuming you already have a microphone, computer and materials to make an antenna including the feedline... this project may only cost the amount spent on the RTL2832U, DVB-T Software Defined Radio (RTL-SDR).  That means this project can be completed for less than a $25 investment for a high quality RTL-SDR or less than a $10 investment for a mini-DVB tuner RTL-SDR.   If you want a lower noise floor system by using the SDRplay the project might be less than $125 and if you want a wider frequency range system for down to DC and further into the GHz range... the system can be made for less than $300 by using a HackRF or other SDR device along with an upconverter and/or downconverter. This is another upconverter by SV1ANF that can be made since he has schematics available or can be purchased.  Potentially the $25 or even more cost effective RTL-SDR can be made since open source and/or improved in performance using some skills you may have or by learning and applying some new skills. Learning the basics of antenna theory, matching the feedline and antenna to the 50 or 75 ohm SDR, how to make antennas from salvaged materials and tuning antennas is going to be very valuable in lowering costs and improving your detection capabilities. There are plenty of great websites and instructables that can be found with an internet web browser search regarding how to construct your range of antennas that are optimal for the frequencies you want to detect. Joining a Facebook (SDR, Antenna, Radio, Electronics, etc. related) group, an ARRL Affiliated Amateur Radio Club and/or earning your FCC Amateur Radio Operator License is a great idea also since many clubs have almost free classes where you can learn more about Amateur Radio and Radio Frequencies (RF).  I recommend buying some books regarding what there is to learn as well as joining a club to advocate and perform \"Fox Hunts\", also know as Radio Direction Finding (RDF). RDF is great to read into for sport and optimizing antenna designs and detection procedures to be directional for use in determining sources of static, noise, interference and/or jamming. Static, noise, interference and/or jamming are the general technical terms in radio lingo for issues with reception or transmission.  Some military radio manuals even note to contact JEWC, or nowadays JEWC is reported to be realigned into JIOWC, if there is a static, noise, interference and/or jamming issue.  Learning electronics, if you haven't started yet, will help save you even more money since you can salvage electronics components to re-purpose.  The salvaged electronic components can be used to make an upconverter and/or a downconverter and/or other modifications and/or circuits for the detection system including the SDR. Learning how to use older super heterodyne receivers or scanners as antenna feeds so you can connect a feedline from the antenna input of the RTL-SDR, or whatever SDR you have, to the super heterodyne receiver or scanner discriminator IF section of the circuit will improve performance also.  Learning cooling methods will help increase the life-cycle and performance of the systems as well.Learning where to salvage those cost effective related components in some cases (Craigslist, Offerup, Letgo, etc.) for the expense of going to get for free will save money. Learning shielding of the system components and shielding the complete system will also improve performance. Again, as already noted, learning how to salvage, recycle, re-purpose and re-use those materials will save money and be an adventure in itself.  Pretty much most old TV's, computer power supplies and radios will have components and materials you can re-use or re-purpose.  From what I've found, the better brands will have better quality components.  Desoldering also helps refine solder skills. A really cost effective $7 electronics component tester, called an LCR meter which stands for Inductance (L) Capacitance (C) Resistance (R), for testing salvaged components can be found online.  I've been a victim of, what I've concluded to be, remote sensing and transmission ElectronicSurveillance (ES), Technical Surveillance (TS) and more advanced ELINT/RINT or some sort of intelligence disciplineElectronic Warfare (EW) weapons systems since I can remember starting in the early 90's.  Prior to that period I was a budding scientist with interests in the range of sciences thinking I'd be an astronaut when I get older or at least a rocket scientist.  That wasn't the case when I realized conflicts that have occurred throughout history and for generations were going to disrupt and corrupt my innocence with brain washing, mind control and cult programming via narcotics and dangerous drugs poisoners who also used and still use remote sensing and communications devices that can transmit sound anywhere around their victims to maliciously lead for continuing criminal enterprises and other racketeering activity brain washing, cult programming and mind control. Even activity in official positions that Internal Affairs, Office Inspector Generals and other special operations groups expose on a regular basis in some departments and offices.  I recently found the DHS is the worst performing of all the U.S. law enforcement agencies.  Beginning in 1998, I didn't notice an issue with the transmissions communications remotely intense until around 2008.  Around that time I started hearing sounds in my perimeter that were people speaking to me that were layered and blended into the ambient conditions sounds if not directly out of thin air from locations that seemed plausible like a ventilation shaft duct.  A shaft and duct that were literally removed from my office since those who I had complained to seemed to think like I did at first in regards to people literally talking down the shaft where there was an opening in a different department.  Then the voices came through the walls and when I didn't find a plausible source that was easily correctable... more than issues from voices began to occur... body assaults started that caused pain, choking, breathing issues, G.I. tract upset and other traumatic events like noted by others online and on this website's Electronic harassment and electronic torture list.I'm not certain the causation(s) in my case.  I did notice consistent perverse sound assaults starting around the time of my publication of my NIR Novel Tool work in the October 2008 edition of American Laboratory.  Those sound assaults turned into body assaults and mind control like noted on the device page of Lonestarconsultinginc's  website.  In particular like noted with the Scanners - The Device or the The ULTIMATE WEAPONS & LAB DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM. I had also worked on assessing, designing, installing, operating, qualifying, documenting in technical documents, training and/or holistic systems validated implementations of FT-IR microscopy, NIR hyperspectral imaging, Terahertz Imaging, Rapid Bacterial Detection, Handheld Raman & NIR ID, Coordinate Measuring Systems and/or other alternate technologies for analytical quality systems functions.  Coupled with the analytical methods understanding, I had researched Medicinal Chemistry since I wanted to be an N.D. and have an awareness of Quantitative Structural Activity Relationships (QSAR).  Back in High School, I had made the association of spectroscopy peaks maybe having something to do with aiding reactions since the chemical entities had some molecular energy associated with those peaks.  Microwave spectroscopy deals with predominantly Rotational Energies of molecules rotational transitions.  Infrared spectroscopy deals with predominantly Vibrational Energies of molecules vibrational modes.  UV-Vis spectroscopy deals with predominantly Electronic Transitional Energies of molecules energy level transitions.  NMR spectroscopy deals with predominantly Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Energies of molecules magnetic moments or transitions between nuclear spin levels during resonant RF irradiation.  There are other forms of spectroscopy like Electronic Spin/Paramagnetic Resonance that deals predominantly with Electron Energies of molecules magnetic moments versus the atomic nuclei as with NMR. Therefore, my theory is that the human body or any living system organs, tissues, cells and molecules can be hacked into based on predictable, calculated and experimentally adjusted known resonance frequencies based on fundamental nuclear, electronic, magnetic, rotational and vibrational states moments and transitions energies and frequencies.  Thus, many medical conditions can be improved without the need for medications other than for limiting nutrients intake.  Conversely, many if not all medical conditions can be created from remote sensing and transmission stations directed energy weapons operations.  Thankfully, that background has helped me explain the issue more detailed I'm finding.  Where others seemed to be reasonably afraid to even discuss in detail, not as mentally capable or committing treason by aiding and abetting if not co-conspirators performing disinformation.  I knew, and know, from my USDA, DHHS and other regulatory agencies training that whomever was operating the directed energy weapons system was in violation of the spirit, intent and letter of the Constitutional and Statutory Law of the U.S. Jurisdiction, Geneva Convention and even International Courts.  The victims need, myself included, an advocate of the truth to save our lives and I wasn't going to let anyone down I can communicate with... even if I have to learn and re-learn skills along the way. I hope and have faith you have learned something new already from just the description in the introduction section of this instructable.

The  basic system consists of a computer with a microphone (built in or if external, an audio system with inputs are required), an available USB port for the SDR, an SDR, optional USB extension cable (to keep the SDR away from the computer to lower noise from  computer), feedline (can use stock that came with the SDR or purchase or make if need to place antenna in a different location), connector adapters  (if needed for the feedline connection to the antenna and/or SDR) and antenna (can use  stock that came with SDR, purchase or make a improved band specific range version).

What most can afford, to see the FFT of the EMF signal if in the Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS) range of the RTL-SDR causing the assault, is an RTL-SDR. There are a few RTL-SDR's under $25 to start off with.   I started off with a cheap black $11 RTL-SDR that came with an antenna and install CD that looks like the blue RTL-SDR in this link: http://www.radioforeveryone.com/p/group-ads-b-tes...I added some copper foil tape around the outside of the case to help better shield the tuner from noise if you noticed in one of the photo's.So technically, if you have the computer system with audio and aren't even savvy with salvaging and maker skills, you can build a DEW Detection System for less than $15.Then I bought a ~$24 RTL-SDR that came with an antenna and USB cable like this one: http://www.radioforeveryone.com/p/group-ads-b-tes...Later I invested in the RTL-SDR.com V3 from rtl-sdr.com and the Nooelec SMArt from Nooelec. Going with the better quality RTL-SDR, you can build a DEW Detection System for less that $25. Most recently; I invested in a mini-DVB tuner that came with an antenna on eBay for $3.99.  This means you can build a DEW Detection System for less that $5.

I am not going into that level of OS installation detail  in this instructable, though this route can be considered in the future  using Kali Linux, Skywave Linux, Andy's Ham Radio Linux or a custom Linux Distro build of your own that has all the software required to detect DEW's is installed. In this  instructable I will discuss my experience with the Linux and Windows  OS's.

Using software comes easy for me usually since I  grew up using computers and my second Bachelors of Science is in  Computer  Information Systems that was originally Systems Analysis and  Application  Development that later changed to a emphasis on  Programming.  I tend to play around with the software until I get a feel  for how the  applications work intuitively with some reading into  various sources of info as I noted previously to answer questions  I  have or regarding issues.  I usually just search online for the  answer  to the issue I'm having or questions I have. Besides the hardware  noted in the Generic Procedure, I've used a  Microsoft Lifecam  Studio  and a  Logitech C920 HD Pro   to record the audio and any  quality microphone can be used.  These  better microphones can be found  at the Goodwill Store, Habitat for Humanity ReStore, other thrift  shops or Surplus Stores for in the  $1-10 range depending on in store sales, if not purchased online, for  under $50.  I started off just using the cheap microphone that  came  with the Windows XP computer I was using at the time when I first   noticed I could see the DEW sound assault in the sound meter when Microsoft Sound Recorder was opened.  I   also recorded the sound assault using the built in microphone on an   older X200 tablet I used to have that was stolen in another incident  where I almost lost my life. I observed a frequency hopping Tetra system looking signal hoping around ~820MHz with the sound. There are even  applications that  can be installed on smartphones to detect and record  the audio and RF  signals that are free or for a small price.  I will not go into that  detail with this instructable unless suggested.  There are resources  that detail how to make a smartphone system online that can be searched  and read or watched.  I have two apps that detect the sound called SpectralView and Noise Meter installed on my phone. There are a few RTL-SDR applications for Android... though I haven't used yet and they require an additional cable to interface.I found being on a computer made   recording the sound, say in a raw format like a .wav or .wma file just   using the Microsoft Sound Recorder, easier and easier to open in a audio processing   and analysis application like Audacity. There  are oscilloscope applications that can be used that use the sound  inputs from the sound card on a computer in a different way than the  SDR.  However,  from my experience there isn't as much information  gained from using  the sound card oscilloscope applications compared to  the Spectrum Lab and/or the Audacity software which have  similar  functions and many more. The Spectrum Lab software is the  best I've found for free for audio and even SDR input detecting. Audacity  is the best I've found for free for audio processing though   technically you can connect an antenna and record directly into any   recording software like Audacity. There may be more ways to process the  audio like changing the sampling rates that I forget the details at this time due to  the trauma inflicted from many continuing criminal enterprise incidents and not just the gun shot  wound and poisoning incidents. If you didn't already know; an antenna can be connected to the line in, or microphone input, of a sound card  keeping in mind to make sure the impedance (really basically  speaking, that's the ohm in AC like  resistance is for DC) is matched,  the signal strength isn't higher than  the input limit on the line in or  microphone input, the length and the  design  for optimal SWR of the  antenna for the frequencies detecting is optimal for best reception. The length of the wire is important for optimal reception with either a long wire antenna or a magnetic loop antenna (mag loop for short) as noted in the picture from a ARRL Handbook.Please share and support this effort as well as encourage others to support this effort to make a healthier, safer, fair and well being World free from forensically clean malicious assaults with DEW's.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FPP/8ZKT/JNAL6TRT/FPP8ZKTJNAL6TRT.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Learn and Practice How to Detect DEW Signals"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "As noted in the Introduction section, there is a lot to learn to cost effectively improve the performance of your system if you haven't learned already.The first thing I did, beside reading a lot of whatever radio related books (like ARRL's) I could find from the Library Inter-library Loans and online, was invest in a discone antenna along with some cable and connectors that can be seen in the photo.  These can be found for under $39 dollars or made from salvaged free or really cost effective materials like copper wire/pipe, aluminum wire/pipe or aluminum ski poles.   Here are some links regarding the discone antenna; the discone antenna wiki, an instructable regarding how to make a discone antenna, a folding discone made from wire and an interesting discone design that I haven't tried yet though found at the bottom of the link an interesting coincidence that I wonder if is related in my U.S. Jurisdiction and maybe a causation for the ongoing forensically clean, to most that don't do their job in forensics, assaults with intent to maim and murder.For my first \"Fox Hunt\" to detect a transmitter of a known frequency, I just used a modified procedure noted in \"Handie-Talkie Tricks\" and seen in the photo that consists of a powdered milk can with a 325 stainless steel screen cut to fit inside the lid, some shop towels to pad the radio that was placed in with the antenna removed.  At first I just used the walkie-talkie against my chest method until I was closer.  When I was close to the transmitter, like maybe 20-30 yards from, I set the antenna to the third harmonic since I was using a cheap Baofeng UV-82 that isn't a superheterodyne radio. The Baofeng's are an SDR technically with auto-gain settings that are noted in the homingin.com  article regarding \"Offset Attenuator\".  If you want to be able to fit the RTL-SDR or other SDR detection system into a can, then this type of system can be made using an ASUS Tinker Board or other microcomputer instead of using a laptop.Next for RDF, I started working on a portable telescopic yagi that is a modified tape measure system described in the May 2007 QST article \"Adapting a Three Element tape Measure Beam for Power Line Noise Hunting\".  As seen in the photo, I need to finish designing the adjustable hairpin matching component and the balun, then assemble.  I plan to mark the tuned lengths with colored scribed lines so I can adjust to frequencies of interest quicker in the field. If you haven't already read into ways to salvage free electronics related components to upgrade your DEW Detection System for the cost of  going to get... I added some images to this last step to provide  inspiration in regards to what can be used that I salvaged mainly from some CRT's and VCR's.  With some salvaged copper  wire or copper pipe and some salvaged connectors and some other  materials along with a free satellite dish, a more powerful DEW  Detection System parabolic trough antenna can be made starting with a  detecting element like shown in one of the many great videos by andrew mcneil who also has instructables to detail how to make various types of  antennas. This is another spiral conical antenna designed for detecting lower frequencies that can be made from salvaged materials. Technically multiple dishes can be used on more advance mounts, like a Dobsonian mount or other designs and even to triangulate more effectively to make a synthetic aperture phased array.  I've picked up a few free old TV yagi antennas for free from Craigslist with masts even and antenna rotators.I want to note also, that ferrite chokes on the USB extension cable or USB cable on both ends can reduce noise. There is a picture of one added and from my understanding you want this on the wire as close to the connector as possible.  This will help filter the DC USB TTL signal from alternating current (AC) noise kind of like helping to prevent the USB cable from being an antenna also.  Once you learn electronics more, you'll find that Kirchhoff's Rule can be applied to any part of an electronic circuit and you'll want to consider filtering and lengths more critically especially at higher frequencies.  These filters components can be salvaged off of power supply cords and other cables.  I've seen some wrap the cable around the cylinder cores lengthwise so the cable goes through the center of the core twice.  This will filter more analog AC signal from interfering with the digital DC USB signal. I added an example of this use of ferrite chokes that are on a cord I just purchased from the Goodwill Store along with a aluminum heat sink laptop plate that has a lot of aluminum that can be used for heat sinks and even making an aluminum enclosure.To keep the RTL-SDR cool, since they tend to overheat and I fried my first one when using somewhere detecting over 1GHz, I salvaged computer video cards heat sinks that can be re-used and cut to size even to be re-purposed as chip heat sinks on your RTL-SDR or any SDR.  I haven't measured the fan spectrum profile of the heat sinks with a fan... though keep in mind if not using a passive heat sink, the fan will make a signal.  Technically, running the whole system on DC is best to remove AC signal sources that can be traced... though theoretically are not just extra noise sources... the AC signal sources could hide rogue DEW sources. Power supplies, especially the higher quality switch mode and plasma TV screens, have ferrite or iron core torroid inductors that can be rewound to be used as filters as noted in the intro section link.  A directional coupler can also me made using the inductors.As I mentioned with two links in the intro section, using the RTL-SDR or SDR as a pan adapter or discriminator tap on old radios or scanners can improve the detection range and capabilities of your DEW Detection System.  These can be found for free or purchased at a reasonable price as noted prior.  The PRO-2006 is more famous for modifications and interfacing to a computer with books even written to detail how to modify and make a discriminator tap with the scanner itself on an older LW or AM radio.  The same idea can be applied to the scanner with an RTL-SDR a discriminator tap as demonstrated in a previous link in the intro section. Old radios can also be salvaged for components like the tuning air gap variable capacitors.  Even old rusty ones can be sand blasted or cleaned to repair the tuning capacitors and be used to tune a mag loop antenna, radio or other antenna tuner. Theoretically, and implemented, there are systems on the market that can detect human body resonance using the microwave region.  Instead of using microwaves, my original objective is to measure human body signals with a magnetic loop antenna using a design that is more compact using high magnetic permeability material to enhance the effect like a ferrite core mag loop noted by N1SPY who also has some other neat ideas for mag loop antennas and by DXerGary. My thoughts are more kind of like this system. I am thinking I can do background subtraction of known sources to enhance the body signals detection and external signal adulteration while not having to be in an Faraday cage and/or anechoic chamber:Therefore, a magnetic loop antenna is a potential candidate for an antenna that can technically be tuned down to even the infrasonic frequencies of the human body resonance... not only ultrasonic. A two fold operation can be performed:1. Monitoring of the person (target) human body internal resonance frequencies that are the typical vital signs monitored and do so in a wireless fashion.  2. Detect external perimeter signals in a directional way if the antenna or a/the perimeter antenna(s) is/are on a turret since I think those detection systems are better than Doppler methods. Technically, with more advanced software like GNU Radio Companion (GRC) and two SDR's, you can learn coding and make custom scripts in GRC to correlate microphone sounds with specific frequency ranges on peaks observed with the sound maybe using a Center of Gravity (CoG) algorithm.  One SDR can be used with a discone or other broadband antenna for a background scan and the other directional antenna like a yagi or parabolic dish/trough can be used for finding where the correlated with sound RF comes from more intensely.  Multiple SDR's can be used for scanning the largest frequency range for example with Spektrum and the other SDR's used for scanning specific smaller frequency ranges found for a faster more real time approach. Maybe you know coding in assembly, or C, and can create a faster operating custom application just for DEW Detection.Eventually you might find, if you enjoy electronic systems, that a real oscilloscope with a bandwidth of 1GHz and an FFT function can be effective for detecting.  This oscilloscope can be used for building, testing and tuning your equipment and can be found used for under $400. Some systems like the TDS-744A can be modified to perform like a TDS-784A also.  There are even deals sometimes on the TDS-820 series that go to 6GHz and TDS-8000 that go even higher.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FIJ/AS4L/JNAL7Y6T/FIJAS4LJNAL7Y6T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQG/4BCB/JNAL6TY8/FQG4BCBJNAL6TY8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F91/MXIC/JNAL6TVG/F91MXICJNAL6TVG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUY/L880/JNNF4ZT0/FUYL880JNNF4ZT0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRB/5J6L/JNNF4ZSY/FRB5J6LJNNF4ZSY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2Y/1MX3/JNAL6VYI/F2Y1MX3JNAL6VYI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3S/DNE1/JNAL6VJX/F3SDNE1JNAL6VJX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2Z/7AKO/JNAL6VDO/F2Z7AKOJNAL6VDO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FT8/KYF5/JNAL6U8B/FT8KYF5JNAL6U8B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9T/DV95/JNAL6ULI/F9TDV95JNAL6ULI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCQ/YHBK/JNAL6X4I/FCQYHBKJNAL6X4I.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTC/7IFK/JNAL6XCD/FTC7IFKJNAL6XCD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FES/VP77/JNAL6U61/FESVP77JNAL6U61.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F73/ASAX/JNAL6TZK/F73ASAXJNAL6TZK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBL/NAHQ/JNCCTWJT/FBLNAHQJNCCTWJT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F65/XO3H/JNAL6U1C/F65XO3HJNAL6U1C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2A/2B4U/JNAL6UHY/F2A2B4UJNAL6UHY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFH/P6LH/JNAL6W31/FFHP6LHJNAL6W31.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ1/NX7W/JNCCTWMT/FJ1NX7WJNCCTWMT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPF/1WNG/JNCCTWOB/FPF1WNGJNCCTWOB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW6/VEC1/JNAL6UQ8/FW6VEC1JNAL6UQ8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FT1/UVC8/JNAL6TQX/FT1UVC8JNAL6TQX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUH/B5Y5/JNCCTWLB/FUHB5Y5JNCCTWLB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWB/EDF9/JNEVF0KG/FWBEDF9JNEVF0KG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Ways to Improve DEW Signals Detection"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "I do have an EMAC that I can try to make a system on also and see what  that is like.

Throughout the process, I'll give detailed instruction on elements of circuit design and why they occurred, as well as a little biology background. The title image is of my heart's electrical signal. By the end of this instructable, you will be able to measure yours too.  Lets get started!ECG is a useful diagnostic tool for medical professionals. It can be used to diagnose a multitude of heart conditions, from the basic heart attack (myocardial infarction), all the way to more advanced cardiac disorders, such as atrial fibrillation, that people may go a majority of their life without noticing. Every heartbeat, your autonomic nervous system is working hard to make your heart beat. It sends electrical signals to the heart, which travel from the SA node to the AV node, and then to the left and right ventricles synchronously, and finally from the endocardium to the epicardium and purkinje fibers, the hearts last line of defense. This complex biological circuit can have issues anywhere along its path, and the ECG can be used to diagnose these issues. I could talk biology all day, but there's already a book on the topic, so check out \"ECG Diagnosis in Clinical Practice\", by Nicholas Peters, Michael Gatzoulis, and Romeo Vecht. This book is extremely easy to read and demonstrates the amazing utility of an ECG. To create the ECG, you will need the following components or acceptable substitutions. For Circuit Design:   Breadboard   OP Amps x 5   Resistors   Capacitors   Wires    Alligator Clips, or other methods of stimulating and measuring   BNC cables   Function Generator   Oscilloscope   DC Power Supply, or batteries if you're handyFor Heart Rate Detection:LabView   DAQ BoardFor Biological Signal Measurement*   Electrodes   Alligator Clips, or electrode leads*I put a warning note above, and I'll discuss the dangers of electrical components to the human body a little bit more. Do not connect this ECG to yourself unless you have ensured that you are using proper isolation techniques. Connecting power-main powered devices such as power supplies, oscilloscopes, and computers directly to the circuit can cause large currents to flow through the circuit in the case of a power surge. Please isolate the circuit from the power main by using battery power and other isolation techniques.Next' I'll discuss the fun part; Circuit design elements!", "title": "Simple ECG and Heart-Rate Detector", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Simple-ECG-and-Heart-Rate-Detector/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Now I'll talk circuit design. I won't discuss circuit schematics, as those will be given after this section. This section is for people who want to understand why we chose the components we did. The Image above, taken from my lab manual at Purdue University, gives us near-everything we need to know to design a basic ECG circuit. This is the frequency composition of an unfiltered ECG signal, with a generic \"amplitude\" (y axis) referring to a dimensionless number for comparative purposes. Now lets talk design!A. Instrumentation AmplifierThe instrumentation amplifier will be the first stage in the circuit. This versatile tool buffers signal, reduces common mode noise, and amplifies signal. We are taking a signal from the human body. Some circuits allow you to use your measurement source as a power supply, as there's adequate charge available with no risk of damage. However, we don't want to hurt our human subjects, so we need to buffer the signal we are interested in measuring. An instrumentation amplifiers allows you to buffer biological signals, since the Op Amp-Inputs have theoretically infinite impedance (this is not the case, in practice, but impedance is usually sufficiently high) which means that no current (theoretically) can flow into the input terminals. The human body has noise. Signals from muscles can cause this noise to manifest itself in ECG signals. To reduce this noise, we can use a difference amplifier to reduce common-mode noise. Essentially, we want to subtract out the noise that is present in your forearm muscles at two electrode placements. An Instrumentation amplifier includes a difference amplifier. Signals in the human body are small. We need to amplify these signals so they can be measured at an appropriate resolution using electrical measurement devices. An instrumentation amplifier provides the gain necessary to do this. See the attached link for more information on instrumentation amplifiers.http://www.electronics-tutorial.net/amplifier/instrumentation-amplifier/index.htmlB. Notch FilterPower lines in the U.S. produce a \"mains hum\" or \"power line noise\" at exactly 60 Hz. In other countries this occurs at 50 Hz. We can see this noise by looking at the image above. Since our ECG signal is still somewhat within the band of interest, we want to remove this noise. To remove this noise, a notch filter can be used, which reduces gain at frequencies within the notch. Some people may not be interested in the higher frequencies on the ECG spectrum, and may choose to create a low pass filter with a cutoff below 60 Hz. However, we wanted to err on the safe side and receive as much of the signal as possible, so a notch filter and low pass filter with a higher cutoff frequency was chosen instead. See the attached link for more information on notch filters.http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/filter/band-st...C. Second-Order Butterworth VCVS Low-Pass FilterThe frequency composition of an ECG signal only extends so far. We want to eliminate signals at higher frequencies, since for our purposes, they are simply noise. Signals from your cell phone, blue tooth device, or laptop are everywhere, and these signals would cause unacceptable noise in the ECG signal. They can be eliminated with a Butterworth Low-Pass filter. Our chosen cutoff frequency was 220 Hz, which in hindsight, was a little high. If i were to create this circuit again, I would choose a cutoff frequency much lower than that, and maybe even experiment with a cutoff frequency below 60 Hz and use a higher order filter instead!This filter is second order. This means that gain \"rolls off\" at a rate of 40 db/decade instead of 20 db/decade like a first order filter would. This steeper roll off provides greater mitigation of high frequency signal. A Butterworth filter was chosen since it is \"maximally flat\" in the pass band, meaning that there is no distortion within the pass band. If you're interested, this link contains awesome information for basic second-order filter design:http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/filter/second-...Now that we've talked circuit design, we can start construction.

The circuit schematic and accompanying design equations are shown above. This was created using OrCAD Pspice designer and simulated using Pspice. The schematic comes out a little blurry when copied from OrCAD, so I apologize for this. I've edited the image to hopefully make some of the resistor values a little clearer. Remember that when creating circuits, reasonable resistance and capacitance values should be chosen such that the practical impedance of the voltage source, practical impedance of the voltage measurement device, and physical size of the resistors and capacitors are taken into account. The design equations are listed above. Initially, we wanted the gain of the instrumentation amplifier to be x1000, and we created this circuit so that we could amplify simulated signals. However, when attaching it to our body, we wanted to reduce the gain to 100 for safety reasons, since breadboards aren't exactly the most stable circuitry interfaces. This was done by hot-swapping resistor 4 to be reduced by a factor of ten. Ideally, your gain out of each stage of the instrumentation amplifier would be the same, but instead our gain became 31.6 for stage 1 and 3.16 for stage 2, giving a gain of 100. I've attached the circuit schematic for a gain of 100 instead of 1000. You will still see simulated and biological signals perfectly fine with this level of gain, but it may not be ideal for digital components with a low resolution.

A center frequency (f0) of 60 Hz was used, with a bandwidth (beta) of 2 rad/s to provide attenuation at frequencies slightly deviating from the center frequency.

For more information on how these values come about, refer to the link in step 2, section C, \"low pass filter\".The specification for C1 is pretty ambiguous, as it's simply less than a value based off C2. I calculated it to be less than or equal to 22 nF, so I chose 10 nF. The circuit worked fine, and the -3 db point was very close to 220 Hz, so I wouldn't worry about this too much.

Try Testing each stage individually, and then test the circuit as a whole. I've attached a sample experiment where I analyzed the function of the notch filter. I noticed sufficient attenuation from 59.5 Hz to 60.5 Hz, but I would have preferred to have a bit more attenuation at the 59.5 and 60.5 Hz points. Nevertheless, time was of the essence, so I moved on and figured I could remove the noise digitally later. Here are some questions you want to consider for your circuit:Is the gain 100?Check the gain at 220 Hz. Is it -3 db or close to that?Check the attenuation at 60 Hz. Is it sufficiently high? Does it still provide some attenuation at 60.5 and 59.5 Hz? How fast does your filter roll off from 220 Hz? Is it -40 db/decade?Is there any current going into either of the inputs?

Nevertheless, learning labVIEW was a valuable experience, as using block diagram logic is much easier than having to hard-code your own logic.There isn't much to say for this section. Connect the output of your circuit to the DAQ board, and connect the DAQ board to the computer. Create the circuit displayed in the following image, hit \"run\", and start collecting data! Make sure your circuit is receiving a waveform. Some important settings in this are:a sampling rate of 500 Hz and a window size of 2500 units means that we are capturing 5 seconds worth of data inside the window. This should be sufficient to see 4-5 heartbeats at rest, and more during exercise. A peak detected of 0.9 was sufficient to detect heart rate. Although this looks like it checks out graphically, it actually took quite a bit of time to arrive upon this value. You should mess around with this until you are accurately calculating heartbeat. A width of \"5\" seemed to be sufficient. Again, this value was tinkered with and did not seem to make intuitive sense. The numeric input to calculate heart rate uses a value of 60. Every time a heartbeat is indicated, it goes through the lower level circuit and returns a 1 every time the heart beats. If we divide this number by 60, we are essentially saying \"divide 60 by the number of beats calculated in the window\". This will return your heart rate, in beats/min.

So imagine you are at the workplace or at your high school/college and you somehow rip your clothing from somewhere. The situation can get pretty embarassing and you cant really get out of it. That is why it is imperitive to have a sewing kit. What you can do in case of an incident is rush to the rest room and stich out the rip easily and it will be good as new. So you can get a small sewing kit like the ones they give during flights or in hotels but in the essence of being a maker, I went ahead and made my own. It didnt require much effort and it came with the awesome feeling that comes with doing it yourself. So here is how you can get to build one yourselfGet a small piece of hard chart paper or a very thin card board and cut it in a rectangle. Cut notches along the longer edge for as many colors you want. cut one small slit on each of the smaller edges    Select colors from your main sewing kit. If you dont have one, just buy the reels as they are pretty inexpensive and you can replenish your kit easily. Recomended colors are black, white, red, green and yellow.    Start by slipping one end in the slit and wrapt it around two notches as long as you feel neccesary and then tuck the other end in the other slit. Repeat for all five colors.    Slip two small sized needles under the threads.     Take two small white buttons and stick them using a small piece of tape.    And you are done. Now just look at how small the size is and how many repairs it is capable of. In my initial kit i used an entire reel of black thread but i realised it was too space consuming and unnecessary. Also there was a need for multiple colors as different repairs call for use of different colors.

Quality always matters. Although you could make do with whatever local brand you have available but I would recommend to go with some high quality water proof bandages. Ones i have are of Tesco. They are pretty good with natural adhesive which sticks well and doesn't leave any sticky residue.Alcohol swabs are also good thing to have. Best to disinfect wounds.

It is very usefull to have a multi tool as it can house a number of useful implements in a small form factor. Having those tools seperately would be inefficient. Things that we require in a multi tool and why:Scissors. A small pair of good, sharp, high quality scissors come in very handy. To cut thread while using the sewing cut or cutting tape. To cut something at the office where you cant find your scissors. They are very practical and a neccesary tool.       Knife. A small and sharp knife is also very important. I can be used to cut some food stuff you want to eat, like an apple. It can also be very usefull to cut open some package or letter. All in all very usefull.       Nail File. This is one of the less important tools but can be helful. If you need to file your nails down after cutting them. Although a nail clipper has a built in file but its mostly of low quality.      Tweezer and Tooth Pick. Not so much useful but they seem to be in multi tools. The tooth pick can be useful if you have teeth that require picking after eating meat. I dont see much practical use to tweezers.      Being small and compact so to fit in out altoids tin. Quality is also important as we dont want a tool failing on us during a situation. There are few tools that covrer all these reuirements. 1. Leatherman Micra: It is an amazing little tool which has all the things we desire. It costs about $25 to $30 which is good considering the quality. The scissors are nice and long for effective cutting. Amazon Link2. Victorinox Classic: This is the tool i own and it also is a fine tool. It is smaller in size hence its implements are much smaller but they still do the job. It is cheaper and costs about $10 to $15.

The importance is universal to all kits. IMPORTANT STUFF RIGHT HERE!!!So now that I have your attention I will begin. The placement of all your stuff is very important not only because it decides how efficiently you use a space but also how much ergonomic it is based on the importance of the things to placed. I have broken it down to steps so that you can easily follow them. Following are the steps. 1. Begin with taking the altoids tin and closing it shut. Then start wrapping PVC Electrical Tape below the beading of the top lid, all around the sides. It will protrude from below but don't worry about that. Keep wrapping until you have the thickness of the tape level with the beading of the lid. When that is done use a very sharp blade or cutter to cut off the protruding part from the bottom to make it flush. 2. Next is to form the bottom most layer. Take a A4 sheet of white paper and half it. Then fold the half to the required size. Place that at the bottom of the empty tin. Above that place the two alcohol swabs. Above that place the first aid bandages making sure its level. 3. On top of that place the sewing kit. Add two razor blades just for good measure. Above that place a single folded tissue paper. 4. The bottom layer is now done. Now the top layer is simple. Place the nail clipper, micro multi tool, micro flash light and pencil along the length of the tin. 5. For the pencil use an ordinary pencil and cut it short using a hack saw. Sharpen it using a pencil sharpener. Now what we will do is wrap the other two tapes around the tape. So wrap duct tape around the pencil until you have about 1 cm in thickness. Besides it wrap the surgical tape to the same thickness. 6. Now you will have some space on the sides. Place the medicines and the safety pins here. Cut the packaging of the medicine to the smallest possible size and each of it individually. 7. Now underneath the lid place four to 5 matches in the center and secure them with tape. 8. You are basically done. If you did everything right, the lid should close easily and with some room to spare. Now to keep our kit snug and without loose bits what we will do is use two more sheets of tissue paper. Fold them up and place them on the very top and close the lid. Don't worry if it doesn't completely close as our case will keep it packed.

Well my solution is to build a Paracord Pouch for the altoids tin which fits fairly snug and has belt attachment capability so that you can attach it to your belt and be awesome :p The build is simple for a Paracord Pro but even a novice will be able to handle it. Following are the materials you will need to build it. 1. About 50ft of Paracord Amazon Link2. Paracord Fid (Buy or Build)3. A KnifeWell I am going to explain the build step by step. I apologize as I dont have step by step pictures. I built this a while ago and I don't have any paracord at hand to recreate it for you guys. But there some similar things on instructables. I will provide the links. 1. First take about 25 ft length of paracord and fold it in half. Now place it along the three edges of the altoids tin (two long and one short edge) to get an approximate of the length. Give about one inch extra and start to form the cobra knot from the open end towards the folded end. Weave until you have the length for the three sides. 2. Now to begin with the horizontal weave. Fix the paracord in the fid. For that you will need to melt the edge and round it a bit. Wrap the cobra length around the tin and start from the bottom to weave horizontally. Pass your fid though the cobra knot over loops. Work your way up to the top. Don't make it too tight as we can adjust it later. When on the top start to weave the other side from top to bottom. Cut the two ends with about 6 inches to spare. 3. Next comes the vertical weave. Same procedure goes. Start from one side of the shorter sides and actually weave your fid through the horizontal lines going up one and below the next. On the top pass your cord over the upper most horizontal cord. Do the for both side and cut the ends with 6 inches to spare. 4. Now place your tin inside and start to tighten all the cords. Don't tighten too much as it will be very hard to use but tighten it a fair bit as it will get loose over time and we don't want it to over loosen.5. Next you need to add the belt attachment. For that you will use another cord and go through the cobra on the longer side about one or two knots from the center. On the other end pass it above the horizontal cord at the far most end. Dont weave it in between as that is where the belt will go. Run it four times and then slip it through the cobra on the same side you started. This needs to be a little loose to accommodate the belt. 6. Test the fits and belt attachment. Once all done you can use a hot knife to seal all the ends. Now first I have to confess that the one i have is not my best work. I did it a while back and didn't have black color back then so went with what i had. So sorry for the crude build. I am sure you guys can make it much slicker. Follow this amazing guide which is the one I followed. It is very helpful and one of the best paracord guides ever created.

You can do this with faux fur material to get the animal look.We are just going to glue it on instead of sewing some kind of pillow case like cover.You can cover in several pieces to make things easier so think about where you want the seams to lay so that they are less noticeable in the finished product.Start by gluing the felt to cover the inside part of the ear. Leave about 1/4 inch extra border around the outside edges.Just glue around the area to be covered leaving the glue shy of the outer edge. The felt is porous and soaks up a lot of glue so it needs more time to dry when glued to the craft foam.Wait until the inner covering glue is dry before you start gluing on the outside pieces. Otherwise, the inner piece will start shifting as you hold it and you will start getting glue all over the felt from places where it seeped through. The errant glue spots will mat down your felt or fabric into hard spots.Leave that extra allowance of felt or fabric on the edges of the ear.Figure out how to best wrap around the front of the ear. I just folded over and glued the excess that wrapped around the curve in the front.Since we have to join the edges of the two pieces of inner ear and outer ear felt covers, we will felt them together to create a seamless look. Felting works by taking a special needle that has bumps on the shaft of the needle to catch fibers as it is inserted into the fabric. With multiple passes, the fibers get intertwined to create one felted mass. Randomly stab the edge over a foam or brush felting block. Pull off the felting block often to brush down and consolidate the loose fibers. Go over the entire edge front and back to felt it. Try not to jab the foam part underneath the felt as It may break the needle.And that's it.The custom headphone cushions should just slip over the headset. You can remove the old ear cushions or leave them as is.

I developped three designs that allows video or audiofeedback. It simply means you can watch a movie or listen to music. As the temperature drops the movie/ music stops, if it raises the movie/ music plays again.\nAnother feedback option is that of visual feedback in the area of Peripheral Vision. Two LED lights are fixed to the right and left of the head at the fringe of the visual field. In order to perceive the feedback, one switches ones vision into peripheral vision. If the desired values go up, the lights will turn on, if they go down, the lights go off. As staying in peripheral vision is connected to the parasymphathic nerv system, the feedback enhances the level of relaxation. However, this feedback modality needs more testing. I would be happy if the viewer would share knowledge and ideas about peripheral vision with me.

It is largely used by performers of various types of physical exercise.This project demonstrates a technique to measure the heart rate by sensing the change in blood volume in a finger artery while the heart is pumping the blood. It consists of an infrared LED that transmits an IR signal through the fingertip of the subject, a part of which is reflected by the blood cells. The reflected signal is detected by a photo diode sensor. The changing blood volume with heartbeat results in a train of pulses at the output of the photo diode, the magnitude of which is too small to be detected directly by a microcontroller. Therefore, a two-stage high gain, active low pass filter is designed using two Operational Amplifiers (OpAmps) to filter and amplify the signal to appropriate voltage level so that the pulses can be counted by a microcontroller. The heart rate is displayed on a 3 digit seven segment display. The microcontroller used in this project is AT89S52 i.e. a 8051 series from Atmel.A key benefit of a heart rate monitor is that it helps you maintain the optimal heart rate target zone for your specific goal. In effect, the HRM is your pacer, telling you when to speed up or slow down. Higher-end models inform you of this via a digital display and/or an audible tone.Exercising in the right heart rate zone helps optimize your performance. A fat-burning goal may require 40 to 80 minutes in one zone, for example, while an aerobic conditioning workout might mean 10 to 40 minutes in another.The target zone is a percentage range based on your maximum heart rate (HRmax). Various algorithms have been developed to calculate an HRmax estimate, but the simplest is:HRmax = 220 \u2013 your age.Plenty of noninvasive methods exist for electronically sensing the human heartbeat. The job can be done acoustically (stethoscope or Doppler), mechanically (sphygmomanometer), electrically (EKG), and optically. One handy optical technique presented here exploits the fact that tiny subcutaneous blood vessels (capillaries) in any patch of skin (fingertip, ear lobe, etc.) furnished with a good blood supply, alternately expand and contract in time with the heartbeat. An ordinary infrared LED/phototransistor pair can sense this rhythmic change as small but detectable variations in skin contrast.Features of the project :1.Non-invasive sensing2.Instant results3.Beep and vibrational alerts4.Computer connectivity for logging and persistent storage5.Report can be printed via a printer directly.", "title": "Heart Rate Monitor With PC Connectivity", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Heart-rate-monitor-with-PC-connectivity/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Heart rate is the number of heartbeats per unit of time and is usually expressed in beats per minute (bpm). In adults, a normal heart beats about 60 to 100 times a minute during resting condition. The resting heart rate is directly related to the health and fitness of a person and hence is important to know. You can measure heart rate at any spot on the body where you can feel a pulse with your fingers. The most common places are wrist and neck. You can count the number of pulses within a certain interval (say 15 sec), and easily determine the heart rate in bpm.This project describes a microcontroller based heart rate measuement system that uses optical sensors to measure the alteration in blood volume at fingertip with each heart beat. The sensor unit consists of an infrared light-emitting-diode (IR LED) and a photodiode, placed side by side as shown below. The IR diode transmits an infrared light into the fingertip (placed over the sensor unit), and the photodiode senses the portion of the light that is reflected back. The intensity of reflected light depends upon the blood volume inside the fingertip. So, each heart beat slightly alters the amount of reflected infrared light that can be detected by the photodiode. With a proper signal conditioning, this little change in the amplitude of the reflected light can be converted into a pulse. The pulses can be later counted by the microcontroller to determine the heart rate. This project is based on the principle of photoplethysmography (PPG) which is a non-invasive method of measuring the variation in blood volume in tissues using a light source and a detector. Since the change in blood volume is synchronous to the heart beat, this technique can be used to calculate the heart rate. The PPG signal has two components, frequently referred to as AC and DC. The AC component is mainly caused by pulsatile changes in arterial blood volume, which is synchronous with the heart beat. So, the AC component can be used as a source of heart rate information. This AC component is superimposed onto a large DC component that relates to the tissues and to the average blood volume. The DC component must be removed to measure the AC waveform with a high signal-to-noise ratio. Since the useful AC signal is only a very small portion of the whole signal, an effective amplification circuit is also required to extract desired information from it.

This means the maximum measurable heart rate is about 160 bpm. The operational amplifier IC used in this circuit is LM741(u can use LM339 also). It operates at a single power supply and provides rail-to-rail output swing. The filtering is necessary to block any higher frequency noises present in the signal. The gain of each filter stage is set to 101, giving the total amplification of about 10000. A 1 uF capacitor at the input of each stage is required to block the dc component in the signal. The two stage amplifier/filter provides sufficient gain to boost the weak signal coming from the photo sensor unit and convert it into a pulse. An LED connected at the output blinks every time a heart beat is detected. The output from the signal conditioner goes to the counter input of the microcontroller circuit.The control and display part of the circuit is also shown above. The display unit comprises of a 3-digit, common anode, seven segment module that is driven using multiplexing technique. The segments a-g are driven through PORT0 pins respectively. The unit\u2019s, ten\u2019s and hundred\u2019s digits are multiplexed with P2.0, P2.1, and P2.2 port pins. Two main tact switches inputs are connected to P3.3 and P1.0 pins for starting stopping the unit and also for selecting various modes. Once the start button is pressed, the microcontroller activates the IR transmission in the sensor unit for 15/30/60 sec(as selected during bootup). During this interval, the number of pulses arriving at the INT0 input is counted. The actual heart rate would be 4/2/1 times the count value, and the resolution of measurement would be 4/2/1. You can see the IR transmission is controlled through P1.2 pint of the microcontroller. The microcontroller runs at 3.579545 MHz using an external crystal. A regulated +5V power supply is derived from an external 9 V battery using an LM7805 regulator IC.
