[{"category": "technology", "description": "Bench top power supplies are one of the must-haves for any electronics hobbyist or maker. But they take up space, which for people like me with limited space, that can be a big problem. With the Analog Discovery 2 and Waveforms 2015, you can bundle multiple tools together in one small package, including an adjustable power supply.For this Instructable you will need:-Analog Discovery 2*-Waveforms 2015 software- a computer with USB port to run the software*Most of the functionality between the Analog Discovery legacy, the AD2 and the Electronics Explorer Board is nearly identical for most of the tools. Except for the Power Supplies. The AD2 has more capability over the legacy version AD1, and the EEBoard has always had more capability than either. With that in mind, I will focus first on the AD2, then on the EEBoard, then the AD legacy.Edit: With the addition of the Digital Discovery there is a fourth version of the Power Supplies tool. This version is covered at the end of this I'ble after the AD legacy.", "title": "Using the Power Supplies With the Analog Discovery 2", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Using-the-Power-Supplies-With-the-Analog-Discovery/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "If you want some help getting your AD2 set up and calibrated, or installing Waveforms 2015, check out this quick start I'ble collection.Once you have your AD2 and Waveforms all set up, open the Power Supplies by clicking on the \"Supplies\" button.This will open the power supplies window.At the top you have three options: \"File\", \"Control\", and \"Window\".\"File\" lets you Save the current power supply settings as a new project.

With master enable on, you can switch between on and off.To the right you have two drop down menus, one for the positive supply (V+) and one for the negative supply (V-). You can directly enter a value here with up to three decimal places. The accuracy of the output compared to the entered value will depend greatly on whether your AD2 is calibrated correctly. The positive supply can have any value between +500 mV and +5 V, while the negative supply can have a value anywhere between -500 mV and -5 V.Since the Analog Discovery 2 can be powered by either the USB or a 5V auxiliary power supply, you'll see one of two notes at the bottom of the window.The USB powered note.The auxiliary power supply note.Most circuits won't require more than the USB capabilities. However, in the event that you do draw more power than the AD2 can output, the program will fault and turn off all tools and outputs.

The calibration is similar to the AD2, and I recommend you calibrate your EEBoard before using it. You will need to have a high wattage (\u224810 W) resistor between 10-50\u03a9 and a quality voltmeter to finish the calibration.Once you have your EEBoard and Waveforms all set up, open the Power Supplies by clicking on the \"Supplies\" button.This will open the power supplies window.At the top you have three options: \"File\", \"Control\", and \"Window\".\"File\" lets you Save the current power supply settings as a new project. You can then Open that project to set the power supplies to the saved setting. You can Export the power supply settings, either as an image or as raw data in *.csv, *.txt, or *.tdms format. You can also Close the power supplies window from here.\"Control\" gives access to the Run and Stop functions.\"Window\" lets you view other Waveforms tools you have open, the main Waveforms screen, or the Help window.Below that you have the controls for each of the four power supply types.At the top left is Master Enable, which will turn on/off any power supply channel that has a check mark in the list below that button. Any channel that is not checked will not turn on with the Master Enable button.To the right of the enable boxes, there are four boxes.At the top left is the Positive Supply (VP+). You can set the voltage to any value between 0 and +9 V out to 3 decimal places. You can also set the max current limit to any value between 0 and 1.5 A out to 3 decimal places. Once VP+ is enabled and turned on, the EEBoard will send back real time voltage and current data, which will be displayed in the box below the drop down menu.Below the Positive Supply is the Negative Supply (VP-). The parameter limitations are the same as for VP+, except negative instead of positive. Real time data will also be displayed once VP- has been enabled and turned on.To the top right you have your Fixed Supply (Vcc). You can choose either +3.3 V or +5 V. This is really useful for powering micro-controllers/processors or FPGA chips that require a steady power supply. Real time voltage and current data is displayed below the drop down menu. You can not limit the current available on this channel.Below the Fixed Supply are the Reference Voltages (Vref1 and Vref2). You can set these values anywhere between -10 V and +10 V. Decimal precision varies with whether you are using mV or V values. There is no real time data from the EEBoard monitoring these pins.Next is the plot window.At the left side you have various metrics that you can use to monitor your circuit. The Value column shows the value as of the last sample.By clicking  you can select from a list of additional metrics to add to the watch list.Double click on the metric you want to add, then click \"Close\". The new metric will appear at the bottom of the list. Note that Vmtr n is an exclusive function to the EEBoard and designates one of four built in voltmeters on the board itself. They measure voltage in reference to the internal GND plane of the EEBoard.Clicking  lets you remove the selected metric, or clear all metrics at once. You can also press \"Delete\" on your keyboard to remove a highlighted metric.With a metric highlighted,  lets you reassign a metric to that slot. You can have as many instances of the same metric as you want. You can also just double click on a metric to reassign that slot to a different metric. will add Maximum and Minimum columns to each metric, next to the Value column. As more samples are taken, these values will change to reflect the max or min value that has been measured by that metric.The History box  sets the total metric history that is viewable in the plot window. You can set this value to most values between 10 s and 24 hours. If the value you enter won't work, the plot will auto correct to the closest value that will work. lets you change the plot update rate and how many samples are shown in the plot window. Be aware that these two values are tied to the value in the History box, and changes in one will likely affect one or both of the other two. will clear the plot window of all metric traces. This can be done at any time, whether the supplies are on or off. New traces will become visible as more samples begin to register.The Plot column has a box for each metric to enable/disable that particular trace on the plot. Check the box to enable the trace.To change the color of the trace, click on the color box in the Color column. Pick your new color from the window that opens and click \"OK\" to change it.Each metric has a small gear icon  in the last column, right next to the plot window. This lets you set the vertical plot scale for that particular metric. Auto adjustment is set by default, but you can set the unit/division value and the offset value.In the top right corner of the plot you see . You can add or remove labels to the plot, change the background from black to white, and change the default trace width for all metrics. If you click on a metric, its trace will be slightly wider than the others and will also rise to the top layer of the plot to make it easier to see.Lastly, just above the top right corner of the plot you'll see . This will make the plot slide closed, widening the metric value columns on the left to allow for clearer viewing of the data. Click it again to slide the plot window back open. The plot will continue to update even if it is closed, and opening it will show the accurate history according to the rate, sample, and history settings.", "step_imgs": ["/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png"], "step_title": "Step 2: Electronics Explorer Board"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "The Analog Discovery Legacy is the original version of the Analog Discovery.Setup and calibration is the same as for the AD2, so if you want some help getting your legacy set up and calibrated, or installing Waveforms 2015, check out this quick start I'ble collection.Once you have your Legacy and Waveforms all set up, open the Power Supplies by clicking on the \"Supplies\" button.This will open the power supplies window.At the top you have three options: \"File\", \"Control\", and \"Window\".\"File\" lets you Save the current power supply settings as a new project.

One way to obtain\u00a0panel meters\u00a0is to visit swap meets or industrial surplus locations.\u00a0Ideally you find meters that have a full scale of 50 or 100 uA.\u00a0The more common full scale is 1 mA.\u00a0Often\u00a0you find panel meters with odd scales, for example pH, or scales marked for high currents like 5 A or\u00a0 odd voltages.\u00a0 These may still be usable. If you are lucky,\u00a0the full scale value (ex. FS=100uA) will be on the meter face in small letters down below where you would normally view.\u00a0 The neat thing about surplus or junkyard meters is they are\u00a0often\u00a0very\u00a0unusual looking.\u00a0So I suggest you keep a look out for these types of panel meters.\u00a0\r\nYou can always buy new\u00a0panel meters,\u00a0the going price is about\u00a0$9 for a 2 - 2.5 inch meter made in Asia. The nice thing about these meters is you can select sensitivities from 50 uA through 1mA for the same price. \u00a0\u00a0One source is BG Micro (http://www.bgmicro.com). The downside is they are a little boring.\r\nWhen you select a meter, make sure that you can easily remove the front. If the front is glued to the back of the meter, pass on it and move on. When you remove the front of the meter, you typically find that the face is attached with a couple of screws to the meter movement.\r\nI used 2 different methods to change the scales on the panel meters\u00a0of my chronulator. On the minute meter, I\u00a0printed out a new scale on plain paper and\u00a0used a glue stick to stick it over the old scale. On my hour meter,\u00a0I printed out a new\u00a0face the same size as the old face on photo paper and flipped the face plate and used a\u00a0glue stick to attach the new face\u00a0to the backside of the plate. In this case, I wanted to retain the look\u00a0of the original face plate by keeping the manufacturer's name and \"Direct Current\" heading.\u00a0The best way to do this is to scan\u00a0the original\u00a0face plate using a flat bed\u00a0scanner. The scanned image then becomes the background layer of\u00a0your new meter face\u00a0in the graphic program you\u00a0use.\u00a0\u00a0\r\nThe ShareBrained Technology site has several meter faces that you can download. They fit the meters used in their Chronulator kits. You might get lucky and be able to use one of them.\r\nThere is also a meter scale program that can be used that has a free limited version available from Tonne Software, http://www.tonnesoftware.com . I haven't used it.One last note, the hour meter scale goes 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. It does not go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

The other way is to keep the\u00a0chip in the Launchpad and\u00a0isolate the prototyping portion of the board. This is done by removing the 5 jumpers from terminal block J3\u00a0and\u00a0supplying 2.5V to the external power\u00a0terminal block J6. When you want to program the chip you have to restore the jumpers and remove the external power supply. If you use this second method you have to hookup the meters and the buttons.\r\nThere is a third way, using the \"spy-by-wire\" interface. In this method\u00a0when we\u00a0build our project breadboard, we include some test points. The test points allow us to connect between the project breadboard and the Launchpad.

We also add nonlinearities to the meter by driving them using PWM (pulse width modulation) and by our homemade meter scales. The c program for this project handles this by providing 2 arrays that are used to individually tune the meter readings.\r\nThe 2 arrays are named m_cal (used\u00a0with minute meter) \u00a0and h_cal (used with hour meter). The 12 members of the array represent the number of clock pulses required to move the meter movement one major division. In the case of the hour meter, this is one hour. In the case of the minute meter, this is 5 minutes. The period for the PWM for both meters is the same. It is 10000 clock pulses.\u00a0\u00a0The sum of all 12 members of a given tuning\u00a0array will be less than the period. I tried to leave about 10% of the PWM period\u00a0as head room. So typically the arrays will sum to about 9000.\r\nThe minute scale has 5 sub-divisions\u00a0(1 min) per major division (5 mins). The hour meter sweeps every major minute division (5 mins), so there are 12 sub-divisions for the hour meter per each major division (1 hr). For this reason the numbers in m_cal should be divisible by 5, and the numbers in h_cal should be divisible by 12. This isn't an absolute requirement, but\u00a0 using other numbers will result in remainders being dropped and could cause confusion.\r\nLet us look at an example. If the hour array (h_cal) is equal to h_cal[] = {720, 708, 696, 736, ...}, to move the meter to 3 O'clock you need to set the PWM pulse count to the sum of 720, 708, and 696, which is equal to 2124. If you were at one O'clock and wanted to go half way between one and two you would add 360 (708 divided by 2 and rounded up to the next number divisible by 12) to 720.\r\nThe arrays that are in the program should be close to what you need regardless of the meter sensitivity you use, since you change the resistors to change the current provided to the meters. You should only have to tune them up.How to tune the meter cal array:Step 1:\r\nWe will start with the minute meter. To make things easier we will change the minute advance from 1 minute per button push to 5 minutes per button push. Locate in the code the following lines and un-comment them. They are part of the port_1 interrupt service routine.\r\n// for (int j = 1; j <= 4; j++) // inc 4 mins Uncomment these 4 lines when tuning m_cal\r\n// {\r\n// one_min();\r\n// }\r\nDisconnect the battery pack of the project board and make the \"spy-by-wire\" connections between the project board and the Launchpad. Load the modified program onto the MSP430.\u00a0 Now everytime we push the minute increment button the minute meter will jump 5 minutes instead of 1.Step 2:\r\nRemove the \"spy-by-wire\" connections form the project board test points and reconnect the battery pack. Press the Reset button.\u00a0Next adjust the zero of the meter. Then press the minute increment button and observe where the meter comes to on the scale. It should be close to 5 minutes. Write down whether it is less than 5, exactly at 5, or greater than five. Press the minute increment button again and determine how close to 10 minutes it is. Do this to about 20 minutes (4 button presses).Step 3:\r\nDisconnect the battery pack of the project board and make the \"spy-by-wire\" connections between the project board and the Launchpad.\u00a0Using your notes adjust the first four members of m_cal based on what you observed. If the meter was higher than expected then adjust the member\u00a0down. If the meter was below what you expected adjust the member up. Start from the\u00a0lower end of the scale and move up. If you see a trend where each time you push the button the difference becomes greater from the desired point reduce all the numbers. If the first one is off a little and the others seem to be off about the same offset, than adjust the first member that is off. I usually make adjustments of 5 or 10, unless I am way off then I make adjustments of 20. After you have made the adjustments to m_cal, enter the debugger and download the changes to the chip.Step 4:\r\nRemove the \"spy-by-wire\" connections form the project board test points and reconnect the battery pack. Observe the results of the changes you made. Repeat steps 2 (without adjusting the meter zero), 3, and 4 as needed, slowly moving up the scale (25 minutes to 60 minutes)\u00a0until every time you hit the minute increment button, the meter goes exactly to a 5 minute major division of the scale.Step 5:\r\nWhen you are happy with the tuning of the minute meter you can move to the hour meter. I suggest that you re-comment the\u00a04 lines we uncommented in step 1 and make sure\u00a0the changed code gets back on the chip.Step 6:\r\nThe tuning of the hour meter h_cal array is similar to\u00a0what you did on minute meter.\u00a0When you hit the hour increment button it should jump to the next hour on the scale.\u00a0The adjustments should be multiples of 12 instead of multiples of 5. I typically make adjustments of 12 and 24.\r\nI know this procedure sounds difficult, but it is really simple\u00a0once you determine how much the meter will move to your adjustment. The whole thing should\u00a0take no\u00a0more than 30 minutes.\r\n\u00a0", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 10: Tuning the Meter Calibration Arrays"}, {"step": 11, "steps_text": "One of the potential gotchas of this type of project is selecting the correct load capacitors (C_load) for the 32.768 kHz crystal. You often have little data about the crystal. Different crystal manufacturers design the crystals with different load capacitor requirements. Searching the web I have seen a range of 6 - 22 pF recommended. The most common one appears to be 12 pf.\r\nDifferences in circuit layout on the project board (or PCB) complicates the problem by adding more capacitance. On the plus side, the MSP430G2211 has the ability to provide different capacitance values to the circuit. We can change the capacitance value within a range by software. In the code you will find the following lines. We will select one based on the result of our tests.\r\n// crystal Cload capacitor adjustment - only one line of next four should be uncommented\r\n//\u00a0BCSCTL3 = LFXT1S_0 + XCAP_3; // 32768KHz crystal, 12.5 pF\r\n// BCSCTL3 = LFXT1S_0 + XCAP_2; // 32768KHz crystal, 10 pF\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0BCSCTL3 = LFXT1S_0 + XCAP_1; // 32768KHz crystal, 6 pF\r\n// BCSCTL3 = LFXT1S_0 + XCAP_0; // 32768KHz crystal, 1 pFImpact of an incorrect selection of C_load:\r\nWhen C_load for a crystal is too high the crystal oscillates at a slightly lower frequency. Likewise, when the capacitance is too low the crystal will oscillate slightly faster. For a 32.768 kHz crystal, we are generally talking about 1 or 2 Hertz. One or two Hertz, you say, that doesn't sound like much. What is the big deal?\r\nThe MSP430's 16 bit timer resets every 2^15 or 32,768 pulses. If we use a crystal that provides exactly 32,768 pulses per second, then the timer will reset every second. If the crystal is actually running at 32,766 pulses per second, the effective MSP430 \"second\" is\r\n1 sec + 2/32766 sec = 1 1/16383 sec\r\nAfter 16383 seconds (~4.55 hours), the Chronulator would be one second behind a clock with a crystal running at 32,768 Hz.

Place your standard next to the Chronulator. Wait until your clock' second hand is at about at 20 seconds and quickly set your chronulator time to just one minute behind your clock. When the clock's second hand approaches 12 (or 60 if digital) push the chronulator's minute increment button to bring the two clocks into sync. Since you will most likely be off a second or two, observe both clocks another minute to get the exact second that the Chronulator's minute meter advances (\"ticks\"). Write down the date, time, and the second of the \"tick\". You will not remember.Step 2:\r\nWait a day or two, then check to see if the both clocks are still in sync. If you are not sure wait a few more days, by that time if they are off, you should be able to tell. If you still can't tell, then things are ok and no adjustment will need to be made.Step 3:\r\nIf the clocks have lost sync, adjust C_load capacitance by changing one of the commented lines above in the c program and commenting the setting that was in use. If your standard clock is ahead of the Chronulator, the Chronulator is slow. Decrease the capacitance value. If your standard clock is behind the Chronulator, the Chronulater is fast. Increase the capacitance value.\r\nWhat if your clock is still fast and you can't increase the capacitance any higher? In this case, you could add 2 very small capacitors (6-12 pF) from each of the crystal's leads to ground. I would just try another crystal. If you decide to add capacitors you can get them from Mouser (6 pf - Mouser part # 81-RPE5C1h6R0D2P1B03 $0.18, 12 pF - Mouser part # 81-RPE5C2!120J2P1Z03 $0.23).\r\nWhat if your clock is still slow and you can't decrease the capacitance any lower? In this case, check if you can reduce the capacitance on your project board. This can be done by making sure that the crystal is close to IC pins 12 and 13. Also make sure\u00a0that the runs for the crystal are short. If this doesn't help, I would try another crystal from another source.By the way, if you have a pulse counter, you can make ACLK available at P1.0 with a simple program (attached below) and check the crystal's frequency in the project board\u00a0directly. I used this technique to observe changes on my Launchpad / crystal setup. I found that the recommended setting of 12 pF (XCAP_3) was a little too\u00a0high C_load. Look at the different photos below to see the results of different XCAP settings. You might wonder about my counter calibration. I feel very comfortable that it is correct, because I was able to achieve a 32,766 Hz setup on my project board / crystal combination.\u00a0With this setup, I observed the 1 second loss every 4.55 hours shown in the table above. When I optimized it for C_load (i.e., observed freq = 32,768 Hz), the clock was right on the money.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FIF/1YQP/GDNJ4956/FIF1YQPGDNJ4956.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJB/AZN8/GDNJ494I/FJBAZN8GDNJ494I.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNZ/FIWI/GDNJ49FO/FNZFIWIGDNJ49FO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3V/PZKQ/GDNJ49F5/F3VPZKQGDNJ49F5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1T/ZBVM/GDNJ49FE/F1TZBVMGDNJ49FE.LARGE.jpg", "/assets/img/pixel.png"], "step_title": "Step 11: Determining the 32.768 KHz Crystal's Load Capacitance"}, {"step": 12, "steps_text": "Q: What about a case?\r\n\tA: See my mantel clock case for this project at:\r\n\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 https://www.instructables.com/id/Mantel-Clock-Case-for-Chronulator-Meter-ClockQ: How does the code work?\r\n\tA:\u00a0\u00a0The watchdog is set to delay mode and creates interrupts at 1 second intervals, using ACLK and the 32.768 kHz watch crystal.

My experience is that this is doable but there are a few critical issues that you have to deal with.\nContemporary DSLR cameras are rather unfriendly\u00a0 to older lenses for different reasons such as the lens-sensor distance , the mounting mechanism or even the camera software.\nIt is important\u00a0 to mount the old lens on the camera at the precise distance without damaging the internal parts..\nIn this instructable I'll show you how this can be done by a specific example using common tools and materials.\nI picked this used and damaged telephoto from a street market.\u00a0 It was a zoom 80-200mm F/4.5, ~400gr weight, with the\u00a0 JCPenney\u00a0 (an American multistore) brand on it\u00a0 and the sign \"made in Japan\" . Even at its own time it would be inferior compared to those made by Yashica, Nikon or Vivitar with similar specifications.\nIt was practically separated in two and full of dust, but the external lenses did not seem to have any scratches. Initially I intended to remove the lenses for other uses but looking at it more carefully I realized that the mechanical problems could be fixed.\nThe challenge was to repair it and mount it on my Olympus E-420.", "title": "How to Repair a Zoom Telephoto Lens and Mount It on Your DSLR Camera", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-repair-a-zoom-telephoto-lens-and-mount-it-o/", "section": "craft", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "\n          Regardless if your lens needs repair or not,\u00a0 this is what you have to do first:Find out the camera-lens distance \n\t\tAttach the camera on a tripod and remove its own lens. Holding the telephoto with both hands in front of your camera with the setting of the telephoto at infinity, try to focus a very distant object. If you have a problem to keep the lens to the correct position use a paper inner tube but do not touch the internal parts of your camera.\n\t\tRotate the focusing ring a few degrees and focus again. In the final construction it is better to set the infinite point a few degrees before the rotation limit. This will allow sharp focusing by leaving some space around the correct point.\n\t\tFocus on close objects. Try to find the minimum focusing distance available. In my case the distance\u00a0 measured\u00a0 was 1.7 meters at 200mm and 1.5 at 80mm.Find/purchase the appropriate adaptor \nA T-ring is the best type of adaptor for this work. It offers two possibilities for mounting a lens, either by using the 42M threading of the internal ring\u00a0 or by removing the ring and fitting the tube on the main connector directly.

La cosa se solucion\u00f3 eliminando una duela en el caso del cuerpo, y agregando media duela en el caso de la tapa. Hay que tener en cuenta que el error en la inclinaci\u00f3n de la hoja de corte se multiplica por el doble de la cantidad de duelas. Lo mismo sucede con la inclinaci\u00f3n del trineo que arrastra la madera. Entonces, si la pieza a construir tiene por ejemplo 18 duelas, un peque\u00f1o error de 1/3 grado (20 minutos de arco) se convierte en un error de 10.8\u00b0, que es muy dif\u00edcil de disimular. Quise comprar un transportador industrial, pero me asust\u00f3 el precio. Mi amigo de Instructables Bill Wells me envi\u00f3 la foto de dos que \u00e9l costruy\u00f3, y eso me decidi\u00f3 a hacer el m\u00edo. Comprar un buen transportador. En cualquier librer\u00eda escolar se puede conseguir un transportador barato y relativamente exacto. Yo consegu\u00ed uno de 1 U$S, y luego dos de 0,25 U$S. Respecto de su exactitud, no tengo muchas posibilidades de verificarla, solo debo confiar en que los fabricantes hayan sido medianamente responsables. Buscar una hoja de sierra usada. Ya he dicho hasta el cansancio que yo no tiro nada a la basura. Particularmente, las hojas de sierra usadas son sumamente \u00fatiles para hacer peque\u00f1as trinchetas, para usarlas ocasionalmente como regla, para reemplazar un resorte, etc. As\u00ed que siempre las tengo a mano. Los dientes se pueden eliminar f\u00e1cilmente con la amoladora de mesa, a efectos de que tenga dos lados rectos y paralelos. Buscar un trocito de chapa de bronce. Cuando una ficha de tomacorriente pasa a mejor vida, las peque\u00f1as piezas de bronce que la formaban sirven para usarlas como contactos o para cosas \"raras\" como esta. Si no conseguimos una chapita que tenga una pesta\u00f1a con agujero como esta, habr\u00e1 que hacerla. Buscar un peque\u00f1o tornillo con tuerca. Si podemos conseguir uno lo suficientemente peque\u00f1o como para que pase por el agujerito de la chapita de bronce, fen\u00f3meno. Si no, se agranda el agujerito y listo. Pero no se lo puede agrandar demasiado, as\u00ed que evaluar si no es m\u00e1s negocio ir a comprar el tornillito con su tuerca. Extender la tuerca. Este paso es m\u00e1s una comodidad futura que una necesidad. Si la tuerca es muy chica, manejarla va a ser un poco m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil. Por lo tanto, es conveniente hacerla calzar dentro de un peque\u00f1o tubo, preferiblemente met\u00e1lico. En mi caso, us\u00e9 un pequeno tubo c\u00f3nico de aluminio, no me pregunten de d\u00f3nde lo saqu\u00e9. Posiblemente haya sido la punta de un bol\u00edgrafo. Hacer una muesca en la hoja de sierra. La chapita de bronce ir\u00e1 soldada de manera que el centro del agujerito por donde pasa el tornillo quede alineado con el borde de la hoja de sierra. Para eso hay que hacerle a esta una muesca con la amoladora. Soldar la chapita de bronce. Limpiar bien con papel de lija la hoja de sierra en las inmediaciones de la muesca, aplicar decapante para soldadura de esta\u00f1o, calentarla ligeramente sobre una llama de gas y apoyar el alambre de esta\u00f1o hasta que se derrita. Desparramarlo sobre la superficie donde ir\u00e1 soldada la chapita de bronce. Esta\u00f1ar tambi\u00e9n esta de la misma manera, y una vez hecho esto, poner en contacto ambas superficies esta\u00f1adas, mantenerlas as\u00ed apretadas con dos pinzas, poner todo unos segundos sobre la llama de gas para que se funda el esta\u00f1o y ambas partes queden soldadas. Agujerear el pl\u00e1stico. La mayor\u00eda de los transportadores pl\u00e1sticos vienen con un peque\u00f1o agujerito en el punto central del \u00e1ngulo a medir. Seguramente ser\u00e1 demasiado chico para que pase el tornillo, as\u00ed que habr\u00e1 que agrandarlo un poco. Armar todo. Pasar el tornillito por el agujero de la chapa de bronce, luego atravesar el pl\u00e1stico y atornillar la tuerca (no muy fuerte). C\u00f3mo se usa: Apoyar el borde inferior del transportador pl\u00e1stico sobre una de las caras del \u00e1ngulo a medir, y luego desplazar la hoja met\u00e1lica hasta que apoye correctamente sobre la otra cara. El extremo opuesto indicar\u00e1 el \u00e1ngulo en la escala del transportador. --------------------------------------When I cut the staves to my first bowl with lid, made with my method, I had measurement errors due to the difficulty of measuring with certain approach the angles involved. The thing was solved by removing a board into the case body, and adding half stave in the case of the lid. Keep in mind that the error in the inclination of the cutting blade is multiplied by twice the number of staves. The same goes with tilting of wood sled. Then, if the part to build is for example 18 staves, a small error of third degree (20 arc minutes) becomes an error of 10.8\u00b0, which is very difficult to conceal. I wanted to buy an industrial protractor, but the price scared me. My Instructables friend Bill Wells sent me the photo of two protractors he made, and I decided to make my own. Buy a good school protractor. In any school library can get a cheap and relatively accurate protractor. I got one for 1 U$S, then two 0.25 U$S. Regarding accuracy, I have not much chance to verify it, I just have to trust that the manufacturers have been fairly responsible. Search for a used saw blade. I have said time and again that I do not throw anything away. Particularly, used saw blades are extremely useful for small cutters, for occasional use as a rule, to replace a spring, etc. So I have always them at hand. The teeth can be easily removed with a table grinder, for the purpose of having two straight and parallel sides. Find a piece of brass plate/sheet. When a piece of outlet passes to better life, small bronze pieces that were used to contact serve to use them as \"weird\" things like this. If not get a piece having a tab with hole like this, we must do it. Find a small screw and nut. If we can get one small enough to fit through the hole of the brass piece, OK. If not, we enlarge the hole and go. But you can not enlarge too much, so evaluate whether business is not going to buy the little screw with nut.Extend the nut. This step is more a future convenience than a necessity. If the nut is too small, handle it will be a little more difficult. Therefore, it is expedient to fit inside a small tube, preferably metal. In my case, I used a small aluminum conical tube, do not ask me where I got it. It may have been the tip of a pen. Make a notch in the blade. The bronze piece should be soldered so that the center of the hole through which the screw is flush with the edge of the saw blade. For that we must make this a notch with the grinder. Weld the brass piece. Clean up with sandpaper the saw blade in the vicinity of the notch, apply flux for soldering tin, heat slightly over a gas flame and support the tin wire until melted. Spread it on the surface where it will be welded bronze piece. Tin it also the same way, and once done, contacting both tinned surfaces, keeping them tight with two clamps, make some few seconds over the gas flame to melt tin and both parts are welded. Drill the plastic. Most plastic protractors come with a small hole in the center point of the angle to be measured. Probably it is too small to pass the screw, so we have to enlarge it a bit. Assemble all. Pierce the little screw through the hole in the brass plate, then through the plastic and screw \u2013not much\u2013 the nut. How to use: rest the bottom edge of the plastic protractor on one side of the angle to be measured, and then move the metal sheet until it rests correctly on the other side. The opposite end shows the angle on the scale of the protractor.", "title": "Herramienta \u00datil (useful Tool)", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Herramienta-%C3%BAtil-useful-tool/", "section": "workshop", "steps": [], "channel": "Tools"}, {"category": "workshop", "description": "When you acquire an older micrometer, like an early 20th century Brown and Sharpe, you may find that it does not properly zero. After cleaning the measuring faces, twice, it still won't zero. It is pretty close, but not quite. The spindle turns freely and has no significant play, but it won't quite zero.Why?Are the faces worn or does one have a burr on it? Nope.Is the frame bent? No indication it has been dropped or hit.The spindle lines up with the anvil, and there is no light visible between the faces when closed. Probably not.I guess it just needs a small adjustment. A well cared for micrometer can go decades without needing an adjustment, but due to slight mishandling, otherwise insignificant wear, and fumble-thumbed efforts to '\"fix\" a micrometer that just needs to be cleaned, many used units need to be zeroed.Modern micrometers, nearly all except some digital types, specialty types, and the very cheapest standard types, adjust by rotating the barrel with a micrometer wrench. Many older mechanical micrometers, and a few modern ones, are adjusted differently. Here, we look at how to adjust older Brown and Sharpe units and older Tubular Micrometer Company (later Tumico, then Scherr-Tumico, and now ST) units. This guide applies to outside micrometer calipers, but also applies to some other types.We see that the Brown and Sharpe #8 above is not properly zeroed. It misses by about 3/10000\". Lets take a look at how this micrometer is adjusted, and then at a Scherr-Tumico 1-2\" micrometer.", "title": "How to Adjust an Older Micrometer", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Adjust-an-Older-Micrometer/", "section": "workshop", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "To understand the adjustment procedure, we'll look at how the unit is constructed. It isn't usually necessary to fully disassemble the micrometer to adjust it, but sometimes it is needed, as the parts may be stuck together by crud or rust.First, make sure the spindle is backed a few turns away from the anvil.The unit shown has a ratchet speeder for force control. Other common options are a friction thimble and no force control. These have a plain end cap. The end cap has a small hole in it for the pin on the micrometer wrench to grab. The wrench is used to loosen the cap. Little force should be needed. Too much force will either break the pin from the wrench or damage the hole in the cap. You should be able to hold the knurled section of the thimble in one hand, and loosen the cap. If it is stuck, Don't Panic! Don't force it. A little penetrating oil in the gap between the cap and the knurling, maybe a little heat- a little heat, like a few seconds from a low power heat gun, NOT the oxy-acetylene torch that you have always wanted to use- and a little time will usually do it. A light rap on the end of the wrench in the loosening direction may help.Once the cap is loose, we can remove it to see that there is a machined button end on the spindle and a machined annular surface inside the cap. On an older unit, these may be covered with crud or rust. They need to be CLEAN. Clean, with no burrs or roughness.Before we continue: DO NOT try to grab the thimble with a vise. You will distort it and ruin the tool. It is a pair of thin metal shells that need to be able to move relative to each other. Any distortion prevents this.At this point, the outer portion of the thimble should be able to slide toward the frame. If it does, Bob's your uncle. If not, then we go for the penetrating oil and time, with maybe a little heat mixed in. It may take a few days for the penetrant to work in. It should take almost no force at all to slip the outer part, but if it has been bound up, a little hand force may be needed. If it won't move after a week or so with penetrant, then decision time comes in: let it be, or up the ante a little. To up the ante, the spindle is fully removed from the frame. DO NOT turn the lock ring or lock lever when the spindle is out. The parts often rely on the spindle for support and may be distorted into uselessness if operated without the support of the spindle.The spindle needs to be held by the smooth portion in a soft, firm holder, such as a piece of soft wood with a hole slightly smaller than the spindle that is then split through the hole. The cap is replaced and threaded down until it touches the button, then BACKED OFF about one turn. Then comes the neanderthal action: A light, sharp tap on the cap with a soft, light mallet, such as a plastic or wooden mallet. You are trying to shock the part loose. The outside will move down the spindle. If not, try again. If it won't move after a few tries, more time and penetrating oil are needed, so give it a day or two.After the first movement, back the cap another turn and see if it moves by hand. If not, another rap. Keep going until it loosens up enough to slip off or you have backed up 3 turns or so on the cap. At this point, remove the cap, since there aren't enough threads engaged to rap safely again. Time and hand work pretty much get it free.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FM8/Q0H9/ISCB810C/FM8Q0H9ISCB810C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIG/EG8P/ISCB810T/FIGEG8PISCB810T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOY/XNDR/ISCB810F/FOYXNDRISCB810F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6U/9SU5/ISCB810I/F6U9SU5ISCB810I.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Disassembly and Parts"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "If we look inside the outer section of the thimble, we see that there is a lip at the end with the marks. This is what the cap works against. The large cylindrical part of the spindle is squeezed between the lip and the cap. This is also what allows us to adjust the micrometer.The inside of the thimble and the outside of the cylinder in the spindle need to be clean and smooth, and ANY crud inside the thimble needs to be removed. Bamboo skewers, cotton swabs, and mineral spirits are good for this. No abrasives. No corrosive chemicals.Once the parts are clean and rust free, light machine oil, like watch oil, sewing machine oil, or, believe it or not, micrometer oil, should be used to wipe the inside of the thimble and the out side of the spindle cylinder. This will allow for easy reassembly, easy adjustment, and help keep crud and moisture out so it can be adjusted again in fifty years. DO NOT use WD40 or any other substance that will get tacky or dry out. ONLY light machine oil.If the spindle threads or the frame bore need cleaning, now is the time. Take care of the wear adjustment ring. It shouldn't be adjusted unless the spindle threads have been started a few turns, and then only snug enough to take the play out. The spindle should turn freely. Just no looseness or slop.Slip the thimble back over the spindle and put the cap on loosely.

It has several benefits, as well as a few frustrating drawbacks.Similar to many other makes, the thimble can be separated from the spindle by removing the screw or speeder from the end. Unusual is that the thimble screws onto the spindle thread, and the end screw is only for locking it in place. In addition, the fine adjustment is done by rotating the graduated end of the thimble relative to the rest. This combination has the advantage that the alignment of the edge of the thimble with the barrel graduations can be adjusted, allowing the user to set it to fully expose the graduations or split them, at her preference, by running the thimble further up or down the spindle thread.

Final adjustment is done by rotating the graduated end of the thimble relative to the rest, and there is significant friction, even compared to the modern movable barrel adjustment most manufacturers use now. Additionally, the joint in exposed and gums up with rust, oil, and hand goo. Yes, your hand produces goo like everyone else's. It gets sticky and may be corrosive. It gets in the joint and makes adjustment a challenge.The joint is next to the hole for the wrench, which is also a size that is difficult to find. In the absence of a wrench, a properly sized steel pin can be inserted in the hole, and a piece of wood with a properly sized hole can be cut in half to hold the pin. It works, but is a bit awkward. In the example (made for a smaller tool), I just used the end of the drill bit.If the adjustment does not want to move, we are back to the penetrating oil and mineral spirits. The thimble should be removed from the spindle, cleaned, and penetrating oil applied. The adjustment should turn holding the knurled portion in one hand and the wrench in the other hand. It should be stiff, but should not need excessive force. If the thimble is clamped up for this, it is quite likely to be distorted and bind up forever. Once the adjustment if free, reinstall the thimble.With the micrometer measuring faces touching (in this case, on the gauge block), hold the knurled section of hte thimble and rotate the graduated section until zero is lined up.You are done.  You now have a functional, properly adjusted micrometer, ready for calibration and use.Calibration? That is where any errors are quantified. For many users, a zero check is all that is done. For critical users, periodic calibration is done to insure that the tool not only zeros properly, but that it is correct over the entire range, and to determine the uncertainty and errors at points throughout the range.

First, I was thinking it was made of 2\" x 4\"s which are really only about 1 1/2\" x 3 1/2\".  2\" x 4\"s are common, easy to get, so it made sense initially.   They are also a known size which we can use to figure out the design.  I counted how many boards there were on the visible side, luckily they alternate long and short so I don't have to try and find each board gap in the photo and hope I don't miss one or double count. There were 40 boards on a side.  I then calculated using the actual size of 2\" x 4\"s (1.5\" x 3.5\").  So 40 boards at 3 1/2\" wide would make one side about 11.67 feet long.  ((40 * 3.5\")/12) = 11.66667 feetThis seemed much longer than what is seemed in the photo.  Now due to the angle of the photo it could have foreshortened the length of the side and it could be that long, but something just wasn't fitting to my eye.  I then took the average weight of a 2\" x 4\" at 1.28 lbs. per linear foot, and calculated what the one visible side would weigh.  (40 * (8' * 1.28 lbs)) = 409.6 poundsSo the total weight of just one side of this portable cabin tent is about 409.6 lbs.   The real weight would be a bit less than that since half the boards are cut down about 1 foot.  And that is without any connecting boards or screws added in.  Trying to wrangle just one side is quite the task for a portable structure.  I then ran the numbers for using 2\" x 3\"s (1.5\" x 2.5\").  ((40 * 2.5\")/12) = 8.3334 feet  (40 * (8' * .94 lbs)) = 300.8 pounds  The length seems to match the size of the side better to my eye, but the weight is still a bit much for a portable structure.  So start looking closer at the photo.  I noticed the end of one of the connecting boards is visible on the underside of the far wall.  The thickness of this board seems much thinner than what I would think of for either a 2\" x 4 or 2\" x 3\", but the 3\" dimensional lumber size works out better in the calculation for the length.  So I revisit the 3\" size and work out the measurements using 1\" x 3\" boards.  ((40 * 2.5\")/12) = 8.3334 feet -- same as the 2\" x 3\" length which looks right.  (40 * (8' * .47 lbs)) = 150.4 pounds This gets us down to a workable approximate weight, but we can figure this out to a closer weight.  Since half the boards look like they are cut down to about 7' and the construction uses 2 boards to connect a side we change our calculation to (22 * (8' * .47 lbs)) + (20 *(7 * .47 lbs)) = 148.52 lbs.  This seems very reasonable for what I am seeing and what it is reported to be used for.  Now that we have an idea of what type of board was used we can start designing.

You can use simple pencil and ruler, even a program as basic as PowerPoint or Word can give you a rough idea of what it might look like, but you will have to work in scale.  Scale - For those who don't know scale is a calculated size change that allows you to draw and design on regular sized paper and draw large things like a house.  A typical size scale for drawing houses would be .25\" = 1'.  Which means for every quarter inch on the paper will equal 1 foot in real life.  Design software lets you draw the object on the screen with the real sizes you want showing as you draw it.  The scale is taken care of when it is printed based on the size of the paper and size of design.  Inside the computer it doesn't matter much since you can zoom in and out, but moving it to real life needs a set scale to keep everything the same when comparing them on paper.  If you are lucky enough to have design software that will give you a vectored pattern at size then even the better because it takes care of the scale for you.  3D design is even better because you can build the entire thing in virtual then rotate it move it around and see if it looks like the sizes in the picture.   Turn the angle so the design matches the angles in the photo and see if what you made matches what you seen in the photo.  The roof design is very easy.  I can see there are alternating long and short boards connected together with two boards running perpendicular to the rest.  So 42 rectangles with a width of 2.5 inches and lengths from 7 feet to 8 feet, alternating lengths, aligned on the bottom and two of those perpendicular to the others holding them all together.  Make two, rotate to face each other and the tops should weave together.  All you need now is something to hold the bottoms from sliding apart and it all falls down on you.  So we need some ends to help stabilize the two sides.  The ends are a bit more difficult.  I can't see the entire end piece where the door goes, and the edges of the boards are not easily seen, due to the angle, the wood grain, the image quality and size.  So my first guess is going to be: What is the full width of the end?  The end appears to be at the very least an isosceles triangle, having two side the same length due to how they are constructed.  It is even more likely an equilateral triangle to keep things strong and the measurements the same.  I design an end with a 7 foot bottom board and two 8 foot boards crossed at 7 foot and just touching the ends of the bottom board to so the relationship of construction.  I then start putting in the other boards to fill these end triangle pieces to see what is the best way to fill the space and to see how to add the door which I guessed to be about 20\" wide by 40\" tall.  I found that when I use a center seam pattern I end up not having to rip cut two boards to fit the door way.  If I use a center board pattern the door the boards need to be rip cut to fit the size.  The nearest board in the photo near the door looks to be full width as does the nearest board in the door.  So it doesn't appear any rip cuts were used in the original.  It is hard to see in the original photo if this is true at the center of the end wall due to the lack of detail in the photo and it being obscured by the roof line.  The build is much easier by not using the center gap than the center board layout on the end.  Fewer boards are used so the cost and work is reduced.  The rear end uses the same pattern, same board cuts, and no door cuts.  The edge boards cannot be seen in the photo, so their placement and use are part of my experience of how to build it to hold it all together solidly.  They appear on the outside in my design only to see where they go to recreate the cabin seen in the original photo.  What I would change from the original photo:  Use 3 boards on the roof pieces rather than the 2 seen.  I would use one at the top of each just under the ends of the 7 foot boards (and likely on the outside), one across the bottoms (on the inside), then one across the center (inside).  I have my basic plan based on what I knew about board size and applied that to reconstructing the original design, which I then thought of some ways I would build it better for me.  I'm not saying my way is right but how I would build it for me.

So lets give them something more to look at.  This is a small design and I am uses to working at scale and some experience in making 3D designs.  I used a small free online 3D design page called TinkerCAD.  Tinker works well for small items for 3D printing, so I need to work at scale for this project to get a feel that the ideas I came up with in the prior step works out.  First build your pieces:  - boards with a 1\" x 3\" profile, a real profile of .75\" x 2.5\" in lengths of 8 foot and 7 foot.  Start moving the pieces in place with a 7 foot base board, and start placing alternating 8 foot and 7 foot boards angled at 60 degrees on opposing sides adding more as you move back inline as the side would go.  The 8 foot boards should cross at the top at the 7 foot line, and the 7 foot boards butting up to the 8 foot boards crossing over them.  Add the end boards using the center seam pattern moving out from the center until the end is filled in.  Each board will need to be trimmed down to match the inside angle of the roof boards.  Once the end is filled use a hole shape to cut the door from the end.  Build the door group the board elements so they move as one object and place the door in the opening.  The size and pattern looked enough like the original that I believe the board size is correct.  In this example I used known sizes of what could be seen in the photo to recreate the design.

Calculating measurements from an unknown takes a little work and some basic mathematics.   First print or display the image you want to work with, and get out your ruler.  Clear plastic rulers are very useful since you can see what is under it.  Printed images are sometimes easier to work with as you can write on them, and set up dimension lines and angles from points to measure from.  If you are displaying it electronically you need to make sure you do not change the size or zoom of the image until your are done.  Changing the display size will change the scaling factor used.  Smaller items that can be printed bigger than what you think they are, will have better accuracy as you scale them down than large items that are being measured with a small ruler and scaled up.  This means that a scaled up image measured to the 1/16\" and that measurement is multiplied by 0.5 to get the real size which will give a measurement to the 1/32\".  Images that are scaled down that are measured to the 1/32\" but needs to be scaled up to a foot or more will have a large variance of where that measurement actually falls.  An error of 1/32\" when measured can result in the real world object being off by a foot or more.  If nothing on the image or in the description of the image gives a measurement or scale of any part of what is pictured you need to make your best estimate of what you think some part might be.  Pick some feature of the image and estimate what the real size would be.  I am picking the rear pin through the trigger to determine the scale factor.  I displayed the image so the head of this pin is 0.75\" displayed, and estimate the head to be 0.375\" in real life, and the pin to be 0.25\".  Using these sizes the ratio to figure out the rest of the dimensions will be 0.5.  So each measurement will be scaled by 0.5 for the real world size.  I set up a spread sheet to keep track of the measurements and automatically do the calculations to real world sizes. Each measurement added to the spreadsheet will be scaled by multiplying the measurement by 0.5.   Start measuring the different parts of each part and their relation to each other.  In this image there are two pins that hold all the parts in a mount so the measure between those two points helps place the parts in relation to each other.  The only problem with this image is there are no images of the top of the trigger system.  Make good descriptions of what is being measured and what that measurement is.  Use the scaling ratio to convert them to real world sizes.  Now that you have the measurements in a spread sheet it becomes easier to recalculate the scale ratio if you find a note that gives a size of the real item all the scaled sizes can be changed quickly either up or down.  If you are using metric it is even easier to convert the sizes.

The interior is another place I had to estimate the sizes, but from my measurements the basic pattern can be made fairly quickly from the side.  When it came to working on the interior I started with estimating what the width of the bolt or arrow to be used.  Estimating a bolt shaft size of between 0.25\" dia. and 0.375\" dia. and using 0.25\" for the two sides of the string catch I estimated the string block to be 0.875\" wide, thus needing the small pin to be at least that long.  I decide to put 0.25\" of material on either side of the string block since it is likely the widest moving piece used in this trigger system.  From this I can estimate the trigger pin and falling block pin would need to be at least 1.375\" long shaft and having a larger head.  The falling block and trigger would be about the same width as the space estimated for the bolt (arrow), between 0.25\" dia. and 0.375\" dia.

The second from choosing a size to assign a part in the image and converting all the measurements taken from the image by the ratio between the assign size and the measurement taken of that same part.  After that it is just measuring and converting those measurements to what may be the real life sizes.  All of this gets very easy with some design programs that allow you in import the images and trace the shapes as separate objects, discard the rest, and resize it all until it gets to the size you want.  You can even check that everything works together well through the movement of the pieces together.  This works very well with smaller objects since less detail is lost in images.  All that from a couple images found online that had no measurements associated with them, no size references in their descriptions, and no plans to build from.

A laser cutter is a machine that uses a focused laser to burn or melt away an image onto a sheet of raw material. Laser cutters can be used to etch or cut a variety of different materials from certain kinds of plastics to leather. It takes a vector file as input and in a few minutes will reproduce it on your chosen material.\u00a0 In this tutorial, I will be using a Trotec laser cutter and Corel Draw to etch a vector image I made onto a small sheet of acrylic. I will briefly discuss the material and vector that I chose before I go into more depth about the printer and printing software itself. Note that this is an overview for this particular kind of laser cutter; there are many kinds of laser cutters and software available. This should give you a general idea of what the process is like. Chances are if there's a laser cutter available to you you'll have to do a bit of research before you can use it.WARNING:\u00a0this is a basic intro to laser cutting as a concept. Laser cutters can be damaged and can be dangerous if not used correctly.\u00a0It is highly recommended that you receive formalized training before using one.

It is common to get the settings or placement wrong when working with an unfamiliar material] After assembling your materials, the first thing you should do is decide what you'd like to etch. Trotec laser cutters can take both raster and vector data. Raster images are composed of a series of pixels. If you choose a raster formatted image, like a .png, .jpg, or .gif, the laser will make deeper marks on darker pixels and lighter marks on lighter pixels. Vector images are composed of equations of lines, curves, and other relavent data. You can make them with programs such as Adobe Illustrator or Corel Draw. If you choose a vector image, the laser will follow the lines described by your inputed file. The strength of the laser will depend on how dark your lines are on a white to black scale.

The name of the tab can be edited by double clicking the tab header.You can trigger the Logic Analyzer several different ways by clicking the \"Trigger\" box.\"Auto\" is selected by default. The tool will wait approximately 2 seconds once started. If no trigger is detected, acquisition will start automatically. \"Normal\" will place the tool in \"Armed\" mode once started. The tool will wait indefinitely for the determined trigger condition, at which point acquisition begins. \"None\" will ignore trigger settings and immediately start acquiring data once the tool is started.You can set the source of your trigger by clicking the \"Source\" box.\"Digital\", \"Scope\", \"Wavegen 1\", \"Wavegen 2\", and \"Patterns\" refer to the Static I/O, Oscilloscope, Waveform Generator, and Pattern Generator tools of the AD2, respectively.

You can also press the delete key on your keyboard to delete a selected protocol. opens the properties editor for whichever protocol channel is selected in the grid. This is the same window that opens when you first select a protocol to add to the grid. drops down the basic trigger settings. You have to have  selected and also have a specific DIO channel selected within the protocol being analyzed to use this menu. You can choose \"X\" to ignore this channel, \"L\" to trigger when the signal is low, \"H\" to trigger when the signal is high, \"R\" to trigger when the signal rises from low to high, \"F\" to trigger when the signal falls from high to low, or \"E\" to trigger on any falling or rising edge. These settings can be set accessed in multiple ways, and most protocols have their own specific trigger settings utilizing a trigger wizard, so if you don't see what you want here, keep reading.Use the scroll bar  above the plot window to move the data window left/right once the data has been captured. Click on the arrows to change the position by a base span and double click to set the leftmost or rightmost position. Double click on the scroll area to reset the time to show the entire acquisition.Below the scroll bar and to the left is the acquisition state indicator . It's simply a visual indicator of the tool state, showing information such as whether the trigger is armed and ready or whether the tool is done collecting data. To the right of that you'll see a print out of the number of samples, sample rate, and time of acquisition for the last acquisition captured. The data displayed here will also change to display data specific to each protocol as you move your mouse cursor over the data captured in each channel in the plot window below.To the far right of the screen you have for buttons, three for hot tracking data in the plot window  and one to change plot window settings . Hot track is explained a bit later with the demonstration example. From the plot window settings you can adjust the plot background color between \"light\" (white), \"dark\" (black), or \"default\" (dark gray). You can adjust the size, from 1-4 point, of the data plotted. You can also adjust and reset where the analyzer starts interpreting the captured data. This can also be accomplished by simply right clicking on the plot where you want to begin analyzing and selecting \"Start from here\". All previous data will be ignored and the remaining data will be interpreted accordingly. The following two images illustrate this with a UART signal.Original UART data captured. Notice how the data 8-bit data packets are clearly interpreted and displayed above as both hexadecimal (h1B, h5B, h6A, h1B, h5B) and ASCII characters (\"ESC\", \"[\", \"j\", \"ESC\", \"[\").Now telling the tool to adjust where to start reading the UART data, beginning where it \"sees\" a UART Start bit. Notice how the data displays incorrectly, missing one packet entirely and complaining of framing errors and skipping some bits. But by the fifth packet (second \"[\") the tool had zeroed in on the correct UART sequence of bits and was able to decipher the remaining data correctly.SignalNow let's add protocols to the grid. By clicking  you can add several different protocols to the grid.Be aware that you can assign DIO channels to multiple protocols, i.e. you can use DIO 0 to watch your UART data signal as well as your I2C SCL signal. Notice the * in the colored box in the IO column to indicate that the DIO is doubled up.Whatever data is captured will be displayed wherever that particular DIO is assigned. Luckily you have 16 DIO pins (32 with the EEBoard), so you should have no problem spacing out your protocols across the pins. Try and avoid doubling up if you can help it.The first protocol in the list is Signal. Note that selecting any protocol will first open a small property editor window.Select one or multiple signals using the \"Shift\" and/or \"Ctrl\" keys on your keyboard. Once you have your channels selected, click  to add the selected signals to the grid.You can edit each channel by double clicking it on the grid, or clicking either edit button, in the grid next to the signal name  or above the grid . For Signal, the only thing you can edit is the name of the channel. You can change the trigger condition from the grid by clicking on the symbol in the \"T\" column. \"X\" is set by default, but the same options described above apply here as well.BusThe next protocol option is \"Bus\".Select the channels you want to use for your bus in the left table. Click  to add them to the table on the right. Remove any channel from the right hand side by selecting it and clicking . Clicking  or  with a channel selected allows you to change the order of the channels in the bus. selects an optional enable pin and polarity. selects the optional clock pin and sampling edge. allows you to choose the numerical format for how the interpreted data is displayed. There are a number of formats to choose from. sets how the data is interpreted, either MSB first or LSB first. and  set the values for the first and last indices. The minimum for LSB is -32 and the maximum for MSB is +31. Changing either will change both, maintaining a separation difference equal to the number of channels assigned to the bus. This tool works like bit shifting the interpreted data, adjusting up/down the max/min values interpreted by the bus by a factor of 2 with each increase/decrease of the indices.You can set the trigger for the bus by setting the trigger value for each channel in the \"T\" column.The tool will only trigger when all conditions for each channel have been met.To enable the protocol trigger wizard, click on the blank box at the top of the \"T\" column, next to the protocol name. will appear in the \"T\" column. Click on it to open the trigger wizard.With this wizard you can set the trigger condition to look for a specific set of bits, corresponding to the decimal value entered in the box.SPINext on the list of protocols is Serial Peripheral Interface, or SPI, which is used extensively in embedded applications for synchronous serial communication.Set the  for your SPI.Assign a DIO to  to watch the slave select signal and set the  status as high or low.Set a second DIO to watch the  clock signal and set it to  on either the clock rising or falling edge.Set a third DIO to watch the  signal (either MISO or MOSI) and set whether the  bit in the data packet is the MSB or LSB. lets you set the bit size of your data packet (1-32 bits). allows you to choose the numerical format for how the interpreted data is displayed. There are a number of formats to choose from. lets you set how many leading bits should be skipped when calculating the data value. Similarly,  sets how many trailing bits should be skipped when calculating the data value.Using  you can delay the start of acquisition with respect to the first sample.Once you have your SPI defined, click  to add it to the grid. Once there, you can edit the SPI properties by double-clicking any of the SPI channels, or by clicking either  or .To enable the protocol trigger wizard, click on the blank box at the top of the \"T\" column, next to the protocol name. will appear in the \"T\" column. Click on it to open the trigger wizard.You can set it to  on SPI start, SPI Stop, or when a specific Value appears in the data packet. If you choose Value, define what value to look for in the  box.I2CThe next protocol on the list is Inter-Intergrated Circuit, or I2C. This protocol is also known as Two-Wire Interface, or TWI. Like SPI, I2C is also used extensively in embedded systems communication.As the alternate name Two-Wire Interface implies, I2C only uses two wires, so the protocol is really easy to set up. Define the  of the protocol and set the  and  channels.Once you have your I2C defined, click  to add the protocol to the grid. Once there, you can edit the I2C properties by double-clicking any of the I2C channels, or by clicking either  or .To enable the protocol trigger wizard, click on the blank box at the top of the \"T\" column, next to the protocol name. will appear in the \"T\" column. Click on it to open the trigger wizard.The default  setting is to trigger once the I2C signal starts. But you can choose from several other options as well.\"Start\" and \"Stop\" have no additional settings to define.\"Any ACK/NAK\" will trigger acquisition on an ACKnowledge or Not AcKnowledge signal.

For this example I'll use UART, and from the reference manual I know that with CLS Revision E (, found on the underside of the PCB), I need to set the communication selection jumpers like so:There are two 6-pin Pmod headers on the CLS, J1 and J2. The silkscreen on the bottom shows the different communication protocol connections.Since I'm using UART, I will need to use the RX pin on J2. I won't be expecting to receive data from the CLS, so the TX pin doesn't need to be connected. Also on J2 are the SCL and SDA pins for I2C communication. Use J1 for SPI communication. Both J1 and J2 have 2 power (V and G) pins for powering the Pmod CLSUsing a 6-pin MTE cable, connect the CLS to the ChipKIT board. The image shows a uC32.Be sure to connect the RX pin on the CLS to the TX pin (1) on the uC32.The CLS has a number of commands in the user guide that can be used for some basic set up. Once that is done, you can start sending text to it. The following code is a very simple example of this.// ASCII values are in HEX, but can be converted to chars by typing a single apostrophe (')\n// before and after the char, e.g. '['. Note that 'ESC' won't work.\nbyte setup_display[] = {0x1B, 0x5B, 0x6A, 0x1B, 0x5B, 0x30, 0x68, 0x1B, 0x5B, 0x32, 0x63};\n                      // ESC,   [,    j,   ESC,   [,   0,     h,   ESC,   [,    2,    c\nbyte clear_display[] = {0x1B, 0x5B, 0x6A};\n                      // ESC,   [,    j\nvoid setup() {\n  Serial.begin(9600);\n  while(!Serial){};\n  Serial.write(setup_display, 11);\n  Serial.write(\"Hello World.

Be sure to also connect one of the AD2 GND wires to a GND pin on the uC32.Set up a UART protocol interpreter with the Logic Analyzer tool. The default property settings will work fine here. Click on the \"X\" in the trigger column and select \"Fall.\"The UART data line holds logic high when not in use. The start bit of the data frame is indicated by dropping the line to logic low, so we know that we are about to get a data packet when the line goes low and the tool will trigger on that first falling edge.In the  box, select Normal so that the tool will wait for the trigger and not automatically begin acquiring data.At the top right of the plot window, enter 4.5 ms in the  box. This will center the plot at 4.5 ms, shifting 0 ms to the left to allow us to see more data.Click  and the tool will wait for the trigger condition to be met, indicated by the status indicator . Reset the microcontroller to begin sending serial data on the TX line. The tool will trigger and acquire 9.5 ms of data.We can see that the analyzer correctly interpreted the data packets and the hex value along with the ASCII character is displayed along the top.The only problem is that we know that we sent a lot more bytes of data than the 9 we can see in the plot. Using the record function, we can capture the entire data stream. Let's look at that.Select Record from the  box. The plot will likely resize, but don't worry the data is all still there. Save it, export it, whatever, but we'll get another sample in a minute.Click  to configure the record function. A configuration window will open.Our serial baud rate is set at 9600, which is essentially 9.6 kHz. We want the sample rate to be significantly higher than that in order to capture the data. The default  should be 200 kHz, but any value higher than 10X baud is fine, just don't go to high or you won't have enough samples in the buffer to record enough data for the time required.Set the number of  to determine how long the tool will record. Multiply your rate by the time required for acquisition to get you samples. In this case I already know that the uC32 is finished transmitting data to the CLS after about 2.5 seconds, so with a rate of 200 kHz, that leaves me with 500,000 samples. is set by the tool in this case, so don't worry about it.Use the  box to set the position on the plot of the first sample. 0% is far left, 100% is far right, and 50% is right in the middle. For this example, set it to 5%.Once everything is set, click  to begin acquisition. The tool will buffer a few samples and then wait in  status. Reset the uC32 to begin transmitting to the CLS. The plot should look like this once it finishes.It doesn't look like much, but luckily we recorded it, so we can zoom in to see the data stream.Use the scroll bar above the plot window to move left or right through the recorded data plot.Notice that the data packets have been interpreted by the tool and both the hexadecimal and ASCII values are displayed at the top of the plot window.Click one of the hot track buttons  at the top right of the plot window.

On a calm day it will measure your height to within 0.2m.  This is effectively measuring the distance from your head to outer space and subtracting it from the distance of your feet to outer space (by measuring pressure \u2013 that is the weight of the air above).  This spectacular device has a range that will comfortably measure the height of Everest - and can also measure down to a few inches.This project was aimed as: a schools project, an example of modifying Arduino code and a good starting place to explore using the MS5611 sensor.  There are plenty of forum questions from those having difficulties with this sensor.  The approach here makes using it very straightforward.  After doing this project you will be well equipped to develop other pressure related applications.Every sensor has its own calibration constants that need to be read and used to correct the data.  There is a library available to help drive these.  The code shown here uses the library to take readings and then converts them to height and displays them on a LCD Shield.First we will send the data to the serial monitor on the PC/laptop for initial tests.  These show some noise and so we add a filter to smooth them out.  Then we will add a LCD display so the unit can run independently and you can try measuring your height \u2013 or anything else.Note the GY63 board just has the MS5611 pressure sensor.  The GY86 is called a 10 degrees of freedom board and also includes a 3 axis accelerometer, 3 axis gyro and a 3 axis magnetometer for just a few $ more.You will need:1.

It can make 4096 3 byte (24bit) analogue measurements in just 8ms and give the average value.  It has to measure both pressure and temperature so the pressure data can be corrected for internal temperature.  Hence it can deliver around 60 pairs of pressure and temperature readings per second.

Click: File>examples>>MS5611-master>MS5611data2serial.A new instance of the IDE will appear with the sketch.   Click the upload button (right arrow). Next start the serial plotter \u2013 click Tools>Serial Plotter and if necessary set the baud to 9600.  The data being sent is the pressure in Pascals.   After a second or so it will re-scale and raising and lowering the sensor by say 0.3m should show as lowering and raising of the trace (lower height is higher pressure). The data has some noise.  See first plot above.  This can be smoothed using a digital filter (a really useful tool).The filter equation is: value = value  + K(new-value) where \u2018value\u2019 is the filtered data, and \u2018new\u2019 is the latest measured.  If K=1 there is no filtering.  For lower values of K the data is smoothed with a time constant of T/K where T is the time between samples.  Here T is around 17ms so a value of 0.1 gives a time constant of 170ms or around 1/6s. The filter can be added by:Add a variable for the filtered data before setup():float filtered = 0;Then add the filter equation after the pressure = \u2026.  line.filtered = filtered + 0.1*(pressure-filtered);It is a good idea to initialise the filtered value to the first reading.  So add an \u2018if\u2019 statement around the the line above that does this so it looks like:if(filtered != 0){ \nfiltered = filtered + 0.1*(pressure-filtered);\n} \nelse { \nfiltered = pressure;          // first reading so set filtered to reading \n}The test \u2018!=\u2019 is \u2018not equal\u2019.  So if \u2018filtered\u2019 is not equal to 0 the filter equation is executed but if it is then it is set to the pressure reading.Lastly we need to change \u2018pressure\u2019 to \u2018filtered\u2019 in the Serial.println statement so we see the filtered value.The best learning is achieved by making the changes above manually.  However I included these in the example MS5611data2serialWfilter.  So if there are problems the example can be loaded.Now upload the code to the Arduino and see the improvement.  See second plot above and note the Y scale is expanded x2.Try a lower value for the filter constant, say 0.02 instead of 0.1, and see the difference.  The data is smoother but with a slower response.  This is a compromise that has to be sought when using this simple filter.  The characteristic is the same as a RC (resistance and capacitance) filter extensively used in electronic circuits.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FVA/958E/IWH3IP0N/FVA958EIWH3IP0N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGP/O783/IWH3IP0M/FGPO783IWH3IP0M.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Connect the Sensor to the Arduino and Test"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Now we will add a LCD Keypad shield, convert the pressure to height in meters, and show it on the display.  We will also add the ability to zero the value by pressing the keypad \u2018Select\u2019 button.With the LCD shield on the Arduino the sensor will have to be connected to the LCD shield.  Unfortunately the LCD shields usually come without the appropriate sockets.  So the options are to make solder connections or to get some socket strip.  Socket strip is available on ebay for not much more than the cost of postage.  Do a search on \u20182.54mm socket strip\u2019 and look for ones that are similar to the ones on the Arduino.   These usually come in 36 or 40 pin lengths.  I would avoid the turned pin ones as they are not deep enough for standard Dupont leads.The socket strip has to be cut to length and the cut has to be made in the same place as a pin.  So for a 6 pin strip \u2013 remove the 7th pin with some fine pliers, then cut at that place using a junior hacksaw.  I file the ends to make them neat.Make sure there are no solder bridges when soldering them onto the board.With the appropriate decision on connecting the sensor plug the LCD shield onto the Arduino and connect the sensor the same pins \u2013 but now on the LCD shield.Also get the battery and lead ready.

These are all connected to analogue input A0.  Each button gives a different voltage to A0.  A search on \u2018arduino lcd shield buttons code\u2019 found some good code at:https://www.dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php/Arduino_LCD_KeyPad_Shield_(SKU:_DFR0009)#Sample_CodeAdd this code before setup():// define some values used by the panel and buttons \nint lcd_key     = 0; \nint adc_key_in  = 0; \n#define btnRIGHT  0 \n#define btnUP     1 \n#define btnDOWN   2 \n#define btnLEFT   3 \n#define btnSELECT 4 \n#define btnNONE   5 \n// read the buttons \nint read_LCD_buttons() \n{ \n adc_key_in = analogRead(0);      // read the value from the sensor \n // my buttons when read are centered at these valies: 0, 144, 329, 504, 741 \n // we add approx 50 to those values and check to see if we are close \n if (adc_key_in > 1000) return btnNONE; // We make this the 1st option for speed reasons since it will be the most likely result \n if (adc_key_in < 50)   return btnRIGHT; \n if (adc_key_in < 250)  return btnUP;  \n if (adc_key_in < 450)  return btnDOWN;  \n if (adc_key_in < 650)  return btnLEFT;  \n if (adc_key_in < 850)  return btnSELECT;  \n return btnNONE;  // when all others fail, return this... \n}Altitude is usually zeroed at the starting point. So we need variables for both height and reference.  Add these before setup() and the function above:float mtr; \nfloat ref = 0;The conversion from pressure in Pascals to meters is almost exactly a division by 12 at sea level.  This formula is fine for most ground based measurements.  There are more accurate formulae that are more appropriate for conversion at high altitudes.  Use these if you are going to use this to record the altitude of a balloon flight.The reference should be set to the first pressure reading so we start at zero height and when the SELECT button is pressed.  Add, after the filter code, and before the Serial.println statement:  if(ref == 0){  \n    ref = filtered/12.0; \n  } \n  if(read_LCD_buttons() == btnSELECT) { \n    ref = filtered/12.0; \n  }After this add the height calculation:  mtr = ref - filtered/12.0;Lastly change the Serial.println statement to send \u2018mtr\u2019 instead of \u2018filtered\u2019, and add code to send \u2018mtr\u2019 to the LCD:  Serial.println(mtr);   // Send pressure via serial (UART) \n  lcd.setCursor(0,1);         // line 2 \n  lcd.print(mtr);All the changes here are included in the example MS5611data2lcd.  Load this as in step 2.There is one last mod that is helpful.  The display is difficult to read when it is being updated 60 times a second.  Our filter is smoothing the data with a time constant around 0.8s.  So updating the display every 0.3s seems plenty enough.So add a counter after all the other variable definitions at the start of the sketch (e.g. after float ref=0;):int i = 0;Then add code to increment 'i' and an 'if' statement to run when it gets to 20 and then set it back to zero and move the Serial and lcd commands within the 'if' statement so these are only executed every 20th reading:  i += 1; \n  if(i>=20) { \n  Serial.println(mtr); // Send pressure via serial (UART) \n  lcd.setCursor(0,1);         // line 2 \n  lcd.print(mtr); \n  i = 0; \n  }I did not include an example with this last modification in order to encourage entering the code manually which aids learning.This project should give a good starting point for example for a digital barometer.

It was initially developed for speech recognition purposes. For more details visit  Wikipedia.Higher the DTW_score, lesser the two time series are matching. For detection of matching the pair of a series, we can compare it to multiple series, with whichever series the DTW score is minimum, it is the matching series.

Yes, there are many LED control guides we can find on the Internet. One objective of my quest was to control a powered LED panel with a defined profile light intensity and real-time clock, and a light sensor to double check the output of LED panel. The input, output of light intensity are logged into SD card for a post-analysis.What are the parts? Below are the parts I have in my projects, details will be present along the way.Optional: I want to mimic a profile of solar intensity, which depends on the region, and the reason. The profile is hours vs. intensity of light. I grew algae so that the particle properties (uE, a photon) of light is the primary metric (can be 2200 uE/m2-s in the range of 400-700 nm in the summer's noon). Other light units are W/m2, lux, candle/ft. The conversion is between those sources have to be taken into account of the light source (or the spectrum of the light source).Optional: The key difference of my setup with other solar simulation is that I use an array to define a solar value (between 0-100%), and another array to store time value. With a defined time interval (5min), the program reads the real-time values, check a time value stored in arrays. If a new values (time, intensity) are found, the Arduino then writes those inputs via PWM pins to the enabling pin the LED driver. See the chart for a less wordy explanation.Important if you have not played with LED before: To turn on the LED, a voltage larger than the forward voltage is applied. The LED (which is a special diode) turn from non-conductible (the internal resistor is very large) to conductible (the resistant is very small). The chip will allow whatever current on DC source to run through. If no heatsink is provided, the chip will be burnt out because of too much heat. You have less than 2sec to see this busting of LED chip. And limiting the current below the forward current is a MUST.Here is a good intro to LED light:", "title": "Control High-powered LED Panel by Arduino Real Time With Log Data, Luminosity Sensor, LCD Display", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Control-High-powered-LED-Panel-by-Arduino-Real-Tim/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "10W (cool-white) LED Chip ( https://goo.gl/hZLC1R), $13/10pcs.

The board is step down voltage which means the input DC has to be larger than Vf of one chip or (x Vf when x of chips is wired together in series).  I wired there chips in serial and applied a DC 36 V for one bank. The light intensity is controlled by PWM on the enable pin via Arduino pin with the resistors to limit the back-wash current.  For this board, full output when the enabling pin is grounded, and zero with 5V reference. I would advise against wiring chips in parallel, except if you want to test the Ohm's law.

An easier way is to download .ino file and open it by Arduino IDE./*Control LED intensity by a timer Log data via a lux sensor By Binh Nguyen, May 13, 2016, update Update on Nov 11, 2017 (removing extra setup for TLS 2591 */ #include                                                          // Wire libary for I2C comunication #include                                                          // Date and time functions using a DS1307 RTC connected via I2C and Wire liRTC_DS1307 rtc;#include                                                           // Needed for SD libarary #include                                                            // SD card to store data#include                                                      //For OLED Display #include  #define OLED_RESET 4 Adafruit_SSD1306 oled(OLED_RESET);#include                                                     // For Luminosity sensor #include \"Adafruit_TSL2591.h\" Adafruit_TSL2591 tsl = Adafruit_TSL2591(2591);                              // pass in a number for the sensor identifier (for your use later) long lux2;                                                                   // store luminosity  const int chipSelect = 53;                                                 // need to figure out for Adafruit SD breakout//https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-micro-sd-breakout-board-card-tutorial/wiring                                                                             // CLK (52|13); DO (50|12); DI (51|11); CS (53|10) char logFileName[] = \"Light.txt\";                                       // modify logFileName to identify your experiment, for exampe PBR_01_02, datalog1 String dataString; long id = 1;                                                            //the id number to enter the log order float hour24 [] =    {0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 4.95,                                  5.20, 5.45, 5.70, 5.95,                        6.20, 6.45, 6.70, 6.95,                       7.20, 7.45, 7.70, 7.95,                        8.20, 8.45, 8.70, 8.95,                        9.20, 9.45, 9.70, 9.95,                       10.20, 10.45, 10.70, 10.95,                       11.20, 11.45, 11.70, 11.95,                       12.20, 12.45, 12.70, 12.95,                       13.20, 13.45, 13.70, 13.95,                       14.20, 14.45, 14.70, 14.95,                       15.20, 15.45, 15.70, 15.95,                       16.20, 16.45, 16.70, 16.95,                       17.20, 17.45, 17.70, 17.95,                       18.20, 18.45, 18.70, 18.95,                       19.20, 19.45, 19.70, 19.95,                       20.0, 21.0, 22.0, 23.0, 23.5, 24.0};                                                              //hour summer 2014 float intensity [] = {0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00,  //hour 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 4.95,                       0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00,      //     5.20, 5.45, 5.70, 5.95,                       0.00, 0.01, 0.02, 0.06,     //     6.20, 6.45, 6.70, 6.95,                       0.09, 0.13, 0.17, 0.22,     //     7.20, 7.45, 7.70, 7.95,                        0.26, 0.34, 0.37, 0.46,     //     8.20, 8.45, 8.70, 8.95,                       0.54, 0.67, 0.65, 0.69,      //    9.20, 9.45, 9.70, 9.95,                       0.77, 0.81, 0.90, 0.78,      //    10.20, 10.45, 10.70, 10.95,                       0.89, 0.76, 0.84, 0.90,     //     11.20, 11.45, 11.70, 11.95,                       0.87, 0.91, 1.00, 0.95,     //     12.20, 12.45, 12.70, 12.95,                       0.83, 0.79, 0.79, 0.84,     //     13.20, 13.45, 13.70, 13.95,                       0.82, 0.60, 0.48, 0.61,     //     14.20, 14.45, 14.70, 14.95,                       0.42, 0.42, 0.47, 0.42,     //     15.20, 15.45, 15.70, 15.95,                       0.39, 0.41, 0.37, 0.27,     //     16.20, 16.45, 16.70, 16.95,                       0.31, 0.33, 0.30, 0.32,     //     17.20, 17.45, 17.70, 17.95,                       0.25, 0.21, 0.18, 0.12,     //     18.20, 18.45, 18.70, 18.95,                       0.07, 0.04, 0.02, 0.01,     //     19.20, 19.45, 19.70, 19.95,                       0.00, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0};       //     20.0, 21.0, 22.0, 23.0                      float timechecker; int pinLED = 9; int pinLEDX = 10;void advancedRead(void){             // More advanced data read example.

For High Speed Data Logging (2000 samples/sec) see this instrucatble, Remote High Speed Data Logging using Arduino/GL AR150/Android/pfodAppThe AtoD converter built into the Arduino's has poor accuracy, typically +/-10% and very limited range, typically 0 to 5V DC volts only. Using a simple circuit and library, you can feed your Arduino with high accuracy auto-ranging measurements from a multimeter with an optically isolated RS232 connection. Having the measurements available to your sketch lets you control outputs based on the values. This tutorial also covers sending the measurement remotely, via WiFi, Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low Energy or SMS, to an Android mobile for display, logging and plotting using pfodApp.This instructable uses an Arduino Mega2560 5V board which you can pair with a wide variety of communication shields, Ethernet, WiFi, Bluetooth V2 (classic), Bluetooth LE or SMS. The interface hardware and library presented here can alos be used with 3.3V Arduino compatible boards. As well as the Mega2560 you can use a wide variety of other boards such as UNO with and Ehternet shield, an ESP8266 base board (stand alone), a board with integrated Bluetooth Low Energy, like Arduino 101, or boards that connect to the communication sub-system using SPI such as RedBear BLE shield and Adafrut's Bluefruit SPI boards. pfodDesignerV2 supports all of these board combinations and will generate the code for them. The limiting condition is that you need to have a free Hardware Serial to connect to the this Multimeter RS232 shield.The circuit and code presented here works with a number of multimeters. A readily available, inexpensive, one is a Tekpower TP4000ZC, also know as Digitek TD-4000ZC. Multimeters that work with this circuit and library include Digitek DT-4000ZC, Digitech QM1538, Digitech QM1537, Digitek DT-9062, Digitek INO2513, Digitech QM1462, PeakTech 3330, Tenma 72-7745, Uni-Trend UT30A, Uni-Trend UT30E, Uni-Trend UT60E, Voltcraft VC 820, Voltcraft VC 840", "title": "High Accuracy Remote Data Logging Using Mulitmeter/Arduino/pfodApp", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/High-Accuracy-Remote-Data-Logging-Using-Mulitmeter/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "This tutorial has two parts:The first part covers the hardware interface to the multimeter and the code library using an Arduino Mega.

The newer Digitek DT-4000ZC and Tekpower TP40000ZC meters come with a USB cable. While the older Digitek QM1538 was provided a RS232 9pin D connector cable.The above circuit (pdf version) shows how to connect the multi-meter's opto coupler to drive an Arduino RX serial pin.  Note: This circuit has been updated to add another protection resistor, R2, for the Digitek DT-4000ZC and Tekpower TP40000ZC meters. This resistor was not included on the 9pin D connector board shown above.Digitek DT-4000ZC and Tekpower TP40000ZCFor the Digitek DT-4000ZC and Tekpower TP40000ZC, you need a 3.5mm audio cable male to male, stereo or mono will do, and a 3.5mm socket.Digitek QM1538For the older Digitek QM1538, you need a 9pin D socket.The 9pin D connector has offset pins that will not plug into the prototype shield. Just cut off the row of 4 pins so you can solder the connector to the board, as the circuit only uses pins in second row of 5 pins. The mounting legs where bent over to let the connector lie flat and the connector was secured to the prototype shield using 2 part epoxy glue (\u201cAraldite\u201d) The connector pin layout is shown above is from this site. The 10K resistor that comes mounted inside the connector of supplied RS232 cables (connected between pins 2 and 3) is not required for this project.Connecting the signal to an Arduino RX pinThis circuit will work for both 5V and 3.3V Arduino boards. Here we are using an Mega2560 (5V) Arduino and mounted the circuit on a prototype shield as shown above.A flying lead is used to connect the TP1 on the shield to a Serial1 RX, pin D19, on the Mega2560.Note about Software Serial: Initially this shield was paired with an UNO using Software Serial on pins 10,11. However when paired with the Bluetooth Shield on Serial at 9600baud, some receive bytes were lost. Moving the RS232 to a Hardware Serial connection solved this issue. So for reliable remote displaying and logging, if you are using a communication shield that connects via serial, you need either a board with two or more Hardware Serials such as the Mega2560. Other alternatives are an UNO with and Ehternet shield, an ESP8266 base board (stand alone), a board with integrated Bluetooth Low Energy like Anduino 101 or boards that connect to the communication sub-system using SPI such as RedBear BLE shield and Adafrut's Bluefruit SPI boards. pfodDesignerV2 supports all of these boards and will generate the code for them.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWO/01KT/J1WW5TV1/FWO01KTJ1WW5TV1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI7/Q6JL/J1WW5TOP/FI7Q6JLJ1WW5TOP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVC/QOPI/J1WW5TLI/FVCQOPIJ1WW5TLI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3P/RECC/IX0PZ03J/F3PRECCIX0PZ03J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAK/TTF0/IX0PZ03L/FAKTTF0IX0PZ03L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3N/BK99/IX0PZ03K/F3NBK99IX0PZ03K.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: The RS232 Interface Hardware"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "The Tekpower TP4000ZC and a number of other mulimeter do not send the measurement via RS232 as ASCII text, rather it sends 14 bytes with bits set depending on which segments of the LCD display that are illuminated.

The more you push the ball away from its neutral position, the harder the spring tries to push it back.This force that the spring is applying is called a \"corrective force\". The strength of our spring's corrective force is proportional to how far from it's neutral position we push it.If you look at the speed controller code, you can find the line where we calculate the P value for our PID (highlighted in the second picture above). In that line, we take the difference between our motor's current speed and the speed we want (stored in the PIDmemory array) and multiply it by some constant. This is our \"corrective force\".Of course, springs are problematic. Let's go back to our ball and spring. Imagine what would happen if you pushed the ball out of its neutral position, and then let go.

So we'll set aside our ball and spring for the time being. Instead check out the illustration for this step.That's Ivan. Ivan is very impatient, and if you take too long to get where you're going, Ivan will start pushing you and speeding you up. The longer you take, the faster Ivan goes.That's kind of what an integral controller does. It keeps track of past errors, and sums them. Therefore, as the error accumulates, the integral controller pushes harder and harder.Now check out the code for the speed controller. The way we calculate I is a little more complex than P or D.

They're used to scale the magnitude of P, I, and D, so that we can control how much influence each one has on the corrected PWM output.As you can see, k_P is much larger than k_D. This is pretty typical. But wait, k_I is zero! Doesn't that mean I has no effect?

However, most of them consist of noisy buck or boost converters, and that noise will find its way into your measurements or amplifiers. Just look at that oscilloscope trace! There are also the odd few designs on here with linear voltage regulators and gigantic heat sinks, these are pretty good for noise but usually can't put out much current, and they get warm. Very warm, which leads to drifts in output voltage or current.For most people these are just fine, especially for digital arduino based projects. But if you need to do some precision analogue measurements or want to mess around with quality audio then you need a quality power supply.This is a high performance mixed mode power supply, meaning that it has low output ripple, can be configured for high current without the need for monster heat sinks or any fans (so it's silent), and it is extremely stable, so the parameters you set (voltage source or current source) do not vary with time, temperature or different loads. In addition, this design can accurately output ultra low voltages (even 0 V, very useful for trouble shooting). Digital control can be added. It can accurately showoutput voltage to +/- 2 mV and current +/-  2 mA with no calibration. It has little output capacitance (so no current spikes).Basically: It's a pretty sweet tool that would cost around half a grand!My design (15 V, 3 A) can be made for around \u00a350 but could be expanded for a little bit extra.", "title": "High Performance Adjustable Power Supply (~\u00a350) With Optional Digital Control", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/High-Performance-Adjustable-Power-Supply-50-With-O/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "So how are these specs possible? Well first you need to know how the different types of power supplies work.All power supplies need a primary power supply (confusing. I know). This is simply an AC/DC converter which outputs a fixed voltage, and can handle the amount of current you want to draw (high enough power rating).After the primary, there are a few different designs which could be used to get the adjustable output voltage/ current:    Switching: these use a buck converter to reduce the voltage to the set output, or to the right level to maintain a constant output current. They are efficient, meaning little power is dissipated on them, but some noise is coupled through to the output, and they may have some nasty RF emissions meaning that everything in the room will pick up some noise.Linear: these use linear voltage regulators to drop the voltage, with basically no output ripple. However, they are very inefficient. So at big voltage drops and high currents, they will get very, very hot! This usually means that all the control circuits on the same board or in the same box also get very hot, so the output can drift.Mixed mode: these designs use both switching and linear regulators. Linear regulators require a voltage drop of around 2 V to work properly, but any more is simply a waste of power. So in mixed mode supplies the majority of the voltage is dropped on an efficient switching regulator, and the rest on a low noise linear regulator. This is great as the output is quiet and the minimal voltage drop on the linear regulator means it doesn't heat up like a kettle. In practice however, this means that the feedback network for voltage control can be complicated. But no need to worry, this design has you covered.    ", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTL/34HY/J34PMF1Z/FTL34HYJ34PMF1Z.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Background"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "This design is based on an article by Keith Szolusha from linear technology. It might seem complicated but stay with me, it's explained step by step in a few key parts (start with the block diagram).At the core are the rugged LT3081 linear regulators which can be connected in parallel to output as much current as you want. I won't do LT's marketing for them but they are pretty awesome regulators.The output  voltage is set by inserting a current into the set pin of each regulator. To get accurate results here, a current source and a potentiometer (to set the output voltage) are used. The LT3081's already have a function for limiting current, which is simply set by a potentiometer between the output and the Ilim pin. This design includes a few more resistors to get the most out of the turning range of a potentiometer.The output voltage of the switching regulator (LTC1624 in this case) is set by a fancy feedback network which puts it 1.7 V above the overall output. This is the minimum voltage drop possible on the linear regulators, so they don't heat up that much in practise. The specs / my design:From my experience, most projects only really require 15 V and 3 A maximum, so this is the basis for this design. But I intend to make several of these units so if need be, they can be put in series or parallel to boost the voltage / current required.The maximum output voltage is limited by the linear regulators and can be 34 V, if you want to alter my design.The primary power supply: The easiest solution here is to use a switching module, it's cheap (\u00a37) and throws out 24 V / up to 9 A :http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/AC-DC-Switching-Power-Su...I have found these to be pretty quiet with RF emission as well, but any constant voltage source will do as long as it has enough watts and high enough voltage for your application.The schematic: Attached is the full schematic for this power supply. I'll explain what each key component does and what you need to look for if you want to use a different chip .Switching regulator: this outputs a voltage that is 1.7 V higher than the set voltage (or set by current limit). In my design I used the LTC1624, which can be found pretty cheap on Ali Express. But you can use a different one without changing the feedback circuit as long as the reference feedback voltage is around 1.2 V (picture). The regulator must be able to handle the combined current output of the power supply.Linear regulators: these are the core of the design, and can be found for \u00a38 a pair:https://www.aliexpress.com/item/2PCS-LOT-LT3081ET7...Each regulator can comfortably handle 1.5 A so put as many in parallel as you require. Usually you cannot do this with regulators but the lt3081 are pretty awesome so as long as there is at least 10 mR resistance on the output of each one then it's fine. I need 3 A so I'm putting 2 in parallel.Current source: this outputs a constant current which sets the output voltage via a potentiometer, around 1mA output per linear regulator is required. Any temperature stable current source will do here, I used the LT3092 as in the original article. It's pretty common so have a look.Negative voltage source: For the linear regulators to work properly, they need at least 4 mA pulled from their output (each). This is a problem at very low voltages, as a resistor cannot be used. The solution is to generate a small negative voltage (-3.3 V) and limit the current flow into it using a transistor. My design  uses an inverting charge pump, LTC1983-3, which only requires a few external caps to work and an npn transistor limits the current to around 10 mA. This could be replaced by any negative voltage source and current set by resistor R12. Voltage and current measurement: this is not critical to the operation of the power supply, but saves you pulling out the multi-meter every time you want to use it. In my design, I wanted something which is accurate to the order of mA (it's useful to see how much current things draw), stable with temperature and requiring little calibration / re-calibration. The perfect solution is a chip by Texas Instruments. The INA260 has an internal current shunt (2 mR!!!! which is crazy) with a built in adc for current / voltage measurement, and is internally calibrated to be accurate to around +/- 1.25 mA and mV. This is extremely hassle-free and goes perfectly with an arduino. However, it is only available from TI themselves, so it costs around \u00a38 for 2 of them. It could be replaced with a current shunt and a current sense amplifier, just be careful that you don't put too many volts into your ADC. If you decide to do this then you will also need some precise current / voltage measurement equipment, and go through a lengthy calibration process with some light statistics (chi-squared fitting). So I would say the \u00a38 is worth it.Voltage /current limit controls: the set voltage / current limit is set by a variable resistor, the simplest solution here is to use some quality, wire wound, 10 turn potentiometers:http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/3590S-2-102L-1K-Ohm-Prec... Although, these can be replaced with digital potentiometers for digital control, described in the next section.  Microcontroller: this is just to display current / voltage. Or is necessary if you want digital control (next section). I used an arduino pro mini clone as it's small and does the business (can talk I2C).  But if you want something with a bit more power then go for an STM32 nucleo board.Display: to show the current / voltage reading from the INA260 I used a cheap 16x2 LCD display. Use anything here as long as it can interface with an arduino.The rest: The rest of the components like capacitors, resistors, transistors... you can use anything you want as long as it can take the volts and amps. If you want to add digital control then a rotary encoder would also help.Bill of materials: A full list can be found on my easy EDA project:https://easyeda.com/andrei.markin/power_supply_for...SimulationYou may have noticed that this is mainly built of LT parts, so I have created a model in LT spice (it's free!!!)http://www.linear.com/designtools/software/#LTspic...You can use it to check what voltages and currents are at each part of the circuit, or see if you can interchange some components. If you want to REALLY know the details of how this circuit works then playing around with this model is the way to go.If you dont know how to use it, afrotechmods made a short and helpful youtube series which will show you the basics:Bottom line:This is a long list but at the end of it you get a quality tool which will last, so definitely worth it!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F6E/62R8/J30SWU5T/F6E62R8J30SWU5T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN3/JWEO/J38WLT72/FN3JWEOJ38WLT72.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLK/FXVT/J30SWA28/FLKFXVTJ30SWA28.LARGE.jpg", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png"], "step_title": "Step 2: The Design"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "If you want your power supply to be digitally configured (i.e. you don't like messing around with potentiometers) then the simple solution is to replace them with digital potentiometers.

In fact, the only suitable  ones that I have found are the MCP41HV51 range from microchip (again not very common I'm afraid). http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/MCP41HV51Keep in mind that a few other issues arise if you want to implement this:1) The resistance does not go in even steps, therefore some calibration is needed to convert step number (in digital potentiometer) to output current / voltage, this is further explained later. 2) The resistance floats with temperature, so put them far away from the regulators on your board. Also, this will be affected by ambient temperature more than wire wound pots.3) Digital potentiometers have wiper resistance which is always there (around 50 R), so this may limit your range of output values.  4) The microcontroller code will get more complex.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FLW/MO17/J34PN2UN/FLWMO17J34PN2UN.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Optional Design Extra: Digital Control"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Aliexpress / eBay should be a good start in searching for the components.

They dictate how the INA260 averages the values in order to give noise free readings.

For this you need to fit some data to a function. The way to do this is using something called chi-squared fitting. I will explain with an example.ExampleLet's say that you are measuring some value (like current) with an ADC. This just gives you a number that you need to turn into a useful value like current in amps. So you measure the current with a meter and record what ADC value relates to what current.Let's call the data that you get (adc output): \"data\", and what you want to turn in into (i.e. the reading on the meter: current in amps): \"real data\". What you need is some kind of mathematical function for which you input data and get \"real\" data out.FirstlyLook at the data and decide what function is appropriate. E.g. plot out the data and real data and look at the relationship. If it is a line then you only need a linear function to turn data into \"real\" data. In practise that has the form y = mx + c OR \"real data\" = (a*data) + b so you just need to find a and b, which are constants. This gets more complicated when your data is not linear and the functions get more complex. The most common functions are included in the picture. For digital potentiometers, unfortunately they usually have a sinusoidal component. But this has the same solution, you just need to find the right constants.Finding the constants To find the constants, the simplest way is to use Microsoft Excel and the solver add-in, I have pictures of an example for a quadratic function with 3 constants to find. First make a spreadsheet with the following columns: real data - the values you want to see e.g. current from multimeterdata - the data you measured e.g. values from adcconstants - these are what you need to find, set them to zero for a startfitted data - this is a function which takes data with constants and, if your constants are perfect, spits out \"real\" data (this will not be the case at the start when the constants are set to 0 but solver will find them for you). This will look something  like \"=(B2*B2*$B$21) + (B2*$C$21) +$D$21\" (my example).Chi - this is the difference between the fitted data and real data. For a perfect fit these would be evenly spaced around 0. This will look something like \"=A2-C2\".Chi-squared - simply square the previous term.Sum - this is a sum of all squared chi terms. The best fit is when this is as low as possible (ideally 0).Now, you need to change the constants to get the lowest possible sum term. Excel has a function called solver which will do this for you. Open it from the data tab and set the objective to the sum cell, the \"variables to change\" to the cells with your constants in them, set to find the minimum and press solve.BAM!! If all is well then you have found an equation which can take your data, use your constants and output the \"real\" data. You can then put this function into an arduino sketch to permanently turn any adc value into a meaningful current!!Sometimes solver does not give you the best answer  you can tell this by looking at the chi plot. If this is not perfectly spread around 0, it means your fit is bad or the function is not the right one for your data (if you have any mathematician friends, I'm sure they would love to help you out for this part). If the fit is bad, you can try getting solver to find the optimum for each constant in turn and see how good you can make it. I have included my Excel spreadsheet as an example so you can play around with it, and if you want to see how to implement this in arduino then have a look at my code in the previous section. The alternative to this method is to simply put a look-up table into your code, but this does not account for random errors in your measurements and takes up a lot of program space.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FKS/FUIX/J34PMQPL/FKSFUIXJ34PMQPL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXF/6D8T/J34PMQLW/FXF6D8TJ34PMQLW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F73/X971/J34PMQLX/F73X971J34PMQLX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJC/YLKV/J34PMQLZ/FJCYLKVJ34PMQLZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ7/8OL5/J34PMQM0/FZ78OL5J34PMQM0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDW/7IZ7/J34PMQM1/FDW7IZ7J34PMQM1.LARGE.jpg", "/assets/img/pixel.png"], "step_title": "Step 7: Calibration (Only for Digitally Controlled)"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Now use your newly acquired power for good.

Pretty sweet!! Have a look for yourself. Remember it's a rugged power supply so don't be afraid of short circuiting it. The only thing I would be careful about is charging batteries, accidentally switching the power supply off while a battery is connected is a known power supply killer, so be careful!  Taking it to the next level: Find a sweet aluminium box to hold your creation. Just look for \"electronics enclosure\" or \"project box\" in the usual places. An aluminium box is recommended  as you can attach the linear regulators to the box to act as a big heat sink, so no fans needed! You can see mine in the pictures, it's pretty small but that's all that is required.I would also recommend making several of these boards, as they are not that expensive and can then be combined to give higher voltage / current, or to be used as a negative and positive rail for amplifiers.In conclusion: Avoid the power supply envy and make yourself something quality.

To do this, I upload the following sketch to the Arduino's microcontroller using the development environment:\nvoid setup() {\n\u00a0 Serial.begin( 9600 );\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 // Open the serial port.\n}\nvoid loop() {\n\u00a0 unsigned int x = analogRead( 0 );\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 // Read 10-bit x-axis accelerometer on ADC pin 0.\n\u00a0 unsigned int y = analogRead( 1 );\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 // Read 10-bit y-axis accelerometer on ADC pin 1.\n\u00a0 unsigned int z = analogRead( 2 );\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 // Read 10-bit z-axis accelerometer on ADC pin 2.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 // Write synchronization bytes to serial port to act as starting markers for each 'packet'.\n\u00a0 Serial.write( 0xA5 );\n\u00a0 Serial.write( 0x5A );\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 // Write x-axis accelerometer to serial port as 16-bit unsigned integer in big-endian format.\n\u00a0 Serial.write( highByte( x ) );\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 // Most significant byte (MSB).\n\u00a0 Serial.write( lowByte( x ) );\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 // Least significant byte (LSB).\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 // Write y-axis accelerometer to serial port as 16-bit unsigned integer in big-endian format.\n\u00a0 Serial.write( highByte( y ) );\n\u00a0 Serial.write( lowByte( y ) );\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 // Write z-axis accelerometer to serial port as 16-bit unsigned integer in big-endian format.\n\u00a0 Serial.write( highByte( z ) );\n\u00a0 Serial.write( lowByte( z ) );\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 delay( 20 );\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 // Add a delay of 20ms to give a sampling rate of approximately 50Hz.\n}\nThe ADC pins have a 10-bit resolution (0 to 1023 inclusive) so I encode them as 16-bit unsigned integers in big-endian format before sending them over the serial port. Depending on the sensor(s) you are using, you can choose to sample more or less of the ADC pins. In my case, the ADXL335 accelerometer measures acceleration along three orthogonal axes: x, y and z. Hence, I sample the three corresponding ADC pins: 0, 1 and 2 respectively.\nFinally, you can alter the sampling rate of the sketch by increasing or decreasing the delay as required. For sensors that do not change very often (e.g. a temperature sensor) you will likely want to increase the delay to sample at a slower rate. Setting it to 100 would sample 10 times per second (or 10Hz) for example.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F7G/G58Q/H347FOT6/F7GG58QH347FOT6.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Connect Arduino and Upload Sketch"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Before I can connect the Arduino to SensorMonkey, I need to map the serial port assigned to the device to a TCP/IP socket. To do this, I download and install Bloom from the SensorMonkey support page.\nBloom is a serial port to TCP/IP socket redirector for Microsoft Windows. It comes with a fairly comprehensive help manual (which I would encourage you to read), but the basic operation is very simple:\n- Run Bloom from the Windows Start menu\n- Configure serial port settings for the Arduino and choose a TCP/IP port for Bloom to listen on\n- Set a polling frequency to (approximately) match the sampling rate of the Arduino's sketch\n- Press 'Start'\nBloom will listen for incoming connections on the specified TCP/IP port. When a connection is accepted, Bloom will open the serial port and transfer data back and forth between the TCP/IP socket and the serial port, allowing SensorMonkey to connect to the Arduino as if it were a networked device with an Ethernet shield.\nI use the following settings:\n- TCP/IP port: 20000\n- Polling frequency: 50\n- Serial port: COM8\n- Baud rate: 9600\n- Data bits: 8\n- Parity bit: None\n- Stop bits: 1\n- Flow control: None\nThe choice of TCP/IP port is arbitrary (you can choose whatever you like, as long as it's in the range 1024 to 49151, inclusive, and not already in use). Also, please bear in mind that your serial port will be different depending on what your Arduino was assigned.\nFor operating systems other than Windows, you can download an alternative to Bloom (typically referred to as a serial-to-network proxy) from our GitHub account. The sketch, named SensorMonkeySerialNet, runs in Processing on Mac OS and Linux.

By clicking on the newly added entry, I can configure the connection parameters; namely, the IP address and port number where the device can be found.\nRecall from Step 3 that I am using Bloom to map the Arduino's serial port to TCP/IP port 20000 on my local machine. So, I enter a port number of 20000 and an IP address of 127.0.0.1 (the local loopback address).\nI also need to specify a format description file that tells SensorMonkey how to parse and interpret the data being sent by the Arduino. In Step 2, I presented the sketch used to sample the accelerometer that was compiled and uploaded to the Arduino's microcontroller using the development environment. To match the data sent by the sketch, I use the following format description file:\n<bytestream>\n\u00a0 \u00a0 <format endian=\"big\">\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <constant>A5</constant>\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <constant>5A</constant>\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <variable type=\"u16\">Accelerometer X</variable>\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <variable type=\"u16\">Accelerometer Y</variable>\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <variable type=\"u16\">Accelerometer Z</variable>\n\u00a0 \u00a0 </format>\n</bytestream>\nNote that I have specified big-endian format (<format endian=\"big\">) and have added variables representing the three axes sampled by the accelerometer: x, y and z. The type of these variables is \"u16\", which is short-hand for 'Unsigned 16-bit Integer'. Many different types of variables are supported; you can find more information on the SensorMonkey support page.\nThe main point to realize here is that you just need to specify a format description file that matches the data being sent by your Arduino over the serial port. Depending on the sensor(s) that you are using, you may need to add more or less variables to your format description file. Make sure to give them descriptive names so you know what each variable is measuring.\nAfter clicking 'Connect', I navigate to the 'Stream' tab, select the three accelerometer variables, choose a stream type of 'Public', and click 'Publish'. The sensor data is now being streamed live over the Internet as a public stream in my personal namespace.\nIn the next step, I will write a simple HTML webpage to connect to my namespace, subscribe to my stream, and visualize the data in real-time using Processing.js.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2V/ZW5W/H337L1RN/F2VZW5WH337L1RN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI1/RC16/H2WETMYQ/FI1RC16H2WETMYQ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Publish Sensor Data"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "In the final (and best!) part of this tutorial, I'm going to create a simple webpage to view the output from my Arduino that is now being streamed live over the Internet using SensorMonkey (I have downloaded the latest Processing.js library - 1.3.6 at the time of writing - and placed it in the same directory as the webpage).

You can edit the Graph.pde file if you need to increase/decrease the size of the graphs, the range of data values that can be plotted, the frame rate etc. Just remember to include the Graph.pde file once for every variable that you want to plot (inside a <canvas> element) and name them accordingly (e.g. <canvas data-processing-sources=\"Graph.pde\" id=\"TemperatureSensor\"></canvas>). Then, you just need to get a reference to the graph (obtained by calling the Processing.getInstanceById() method) and use the update() function to plot new data points received in the \"publish\" and \"bulkPublish\" event handlers.That's it!

A ground receiver displays the data in real time.The base altitude is stored in Eeprom memory. This can be altered by connecting the transmitter to a PC and issuing a simple Serial command.TransmitterI decided to use the MPL3115A2 pressure sensor with the non breakout version of  the RFM69CW 433Mhz wireless tramsmitter / receiver.  For those requiring extended range I believe there is a RFM69HCW version, with a slightly larger transmitting current. I used a dipole aerial setup- with a 17.3cm wire on the aerial input and the ground.For the processor, I used an Arduino Pro mini 8MHz 3V3 which is small and light.A 3V3 regulator provides the correct voltage using either the planes lipo balance plug as  the supply, or a spare servo connector.  I used a LD1117V33 3v3 reg which is rated at 800mA. (Because I had them.)  Any good low dropout regulator would work, with a minimum current capability of 500mA.With a small balsa box I was able to get the mass down to 12.55g..Parts:Arduino Pro mini 8MHz 3V3 ( http://www.hobbytronics.co.uk ) FTDI Basic Breakout Plus 5V/3.3V for programming the Arduino ( http://www.hobbytronics.co.uk ) Or equivalent You will need to program 5V0 and 3V3 systems.

I recommend considering the final size of the containing box before soldering any wires.Assemble the regulator on a small piece of stripboard, with the smoothing capacitors. Connect a pair of wires for the supply. If you are using a spare servo connection as the supply add a servo socket with no data lead. NB check the plane's receiver is capable of supplying 400-500mA. If you are using the Lipo balance plug add a section of Single Row Header (0.1 inch pitch) with all but the 0 and max voltage pins removed. Then heat shrink to seal..It is prudent to check the output of your regulator using a suitable 2-3S LipoNB do not reverse connect to the lipo balance plug. You will blow the regulator and the pressure sensor. If this is a concern, use a 1n4001 diode in series with your positive lead..Connect the components to the 8MHz 3v3 Pro Mini as per the diagram.  Keep the leads short and use good quality wires.The Arduino will need a 6 pin strip of single pole header pins at the opposite end to the reset button. Depending on your FTDI you may find 90 degree header pins a better option. Note the marked colours on the Arduino 6 pin end and match to your FTDI programmer.  I find marking both the Arduino and programmer with Tippex particularly useful.The aerial wires should be 17.3 cm long after the wire exits the pcb. I attached one to the aerial point on the  RFM69CW and the second to the zero voltage point on the arduino used to ground the RFM69CW.  I deducted the length of the ground wire from the RFM to the arduino from 17.3cm, before cutting the ground aerial to length.  The aerial wires were fixed with a bit of 90 second araldite to prevent shearing.The Switch across pins 5 and 6 of the Arduino can be contructed by soldering a 2 pin header socket onto the board.  Solder two pins from single pole header together to form a jumper link. It is best to solder a small length of wire then remove and renew the plastic connector.  Araldite any bare metal on the top of the switch for insulation. Removing the link allows Serial output. Alternatively- solder two pins of single pole header to the board and use a 0.1\" jumper link.I used scraps of balsa wood and thin isocyanate glue to fabricate a box. I kept the 3 components separate with small balsa runners. The pressure sensor is light sensitive, so I made a small tray to shield it.  I cut a circular hole in the outer box directly above the rectangular sensor and then covered it with a piece of foam.Vent holes were cut to ensure air flow. Exit holes were required for one aerial lead and the led. I used a carbon rod to pin the tray and regulator in place..Software and PreparationThe pressure sensor will need to be calibrated for pressure and temperature.As altitude is a function of the atmospheric pressure at sea level and the pressure at the unknown altitude, we need to estimate sea level pressure. It is also a function of temperature, however we can leave this factor out in a reasonable approximation.A good estimate of sea level pressure can be obtained by reading the pressure at a known altitude- The base level. In my case the kichen table.  So, look up the altitude for your house and adjust for the position of your transmitter. You will also need a reliable value for sea level atmospheric pressure for your calibration period.  I used reports from internet weather sites.Download RFM69_transmitter3.zip and install the folder in your Arduino program folder. Move the RFM69 library folder to your Arduino library folder.

For this sensor we need to apply a small negative correction to the variable pcorrection. The correction must be divisible by 4.I recommend you apply similar positive or negative corrections until your sensor is calibrated.Note that the un-calibrated altitude value is pretty good. This is because today's pressure is close to the sensors default value of atmospheric pressure used in altitude calculations (101326Pa) On another day the internal sensor altitude value will be well out.For this reason we establish sea level pressure with a calibrated sensor and then perform our own altitude calculation based on the local pressure..2) TemperatureThis is a bit more problematic!According to the manufacturer's website the temperature sensor was never really intended to provide ambient temperature values. Apparently it provides the temperature of the \"sensor die\".Since the die temperature must be affected by atmospheric temperature we should be able to calibrate the temperature data to extract ambient values.The sensor appears to self heat over the first 17 minutes before establishing a temperature value which is constantly above the ambient temperature. This heating must affect the internal temperature compensation for the returned pressure value. I believe this is the cause of observed pressure drift for a stationary MPL3115A2 sensor.  We do not have a means of fixing this internal correction, but we can calibrate for atmospheric temperature.Prepare a table of Time and temperature:Time.. | Temperature0.000 |13/60 |1.000 |2.000 |..up to 17 minutes.The temperature at time zero will be the Base Temp and the value at 13 seconds the first reported value.The transmitter reports in this format:   D>P:0.0,0.0,25.0 C (Presure 100767.75 Pa ) 0:13 D>P: current altitude, max altitude, current temperature (local pressure) minutes:secondsLet the transmitter cool. Be patient. The die appears to retain heat and will affect the initial start-up temperature..Record the current room temperature, preferably to 1 decimal place.Plug in the transmitter to the PC with the Serial Inhibit link out.Record the temperatures. Open the spreadsheet calibrateTemp.xlsxEnter Room temperature in cell F3 and the temperature data in B3 to B21.The spreadsheet will produce temperature correction parameters.For the first minute I have assumed a linear correction:  Correction = mUB * Time + ccUBFor the remaining period:  Correction = aUB * Time^3 + bUB * Time^2 + cUB * Time + dUB.Edit the temperature coefficients in the RFM69_transmitter3 sketchAmend the temperature correction values in the unboxed section, using the spreadsheet values.

The mounting holes in the oled are close to the screen. Do not be tempted to use larger bolts.  I used nuts on the inside to act as spaces and then additional nuts to secure. Mark out and cut the hole for the oled screen before connecting the screen to wires. Check the bolt positions. Drill the holes, cut the bolts to length and secure the spacer nuts.The RFM can be mounted at an angle with the aerials at the top. I used two short 12BA bolts and nuts.

With this project, I\u2019ll show you how I did just that, using off-the-shelf open source hardware and software to build an Arduino compatible flight telemetry system. Model rocketry telemetry is nothing new.\u00a0Amateurs\u00a0have been stuffing electronics in rockets since the beginning of the hobby. A programmable micro-controller coupled with a low-power radio, however, allows us to take the hobby to a whole new level. What makes this project notable is: - Wireless data transmission allowing in-flight monitoring or post-flight data downloading without the need to physically access the on-board hardware. - Constructed from easily available open source hardware and software, allowing anyone with modest soldering and programing skills to put together a configuration to acquire and record any data they desire. No custom PCBs, chip programmers, or toolchains to setup as in my last well received, but little followed Instructable (https://www.instructables.com/id/Buggy-A-Crafty-Programmable-LED-Creature/)!  If you haven't heard of Arduino yet, or if you are rolling your eyes at \"yet another Arduino project\", you should read Phillip Torrone's take on it and his prediction that \"within the next 5 to 10 years, the Arduino will be used in every school to teach electronics and physical computing.\"Details, in brief: A 50 gram, on-board micro-controller collects pressure and acceleration data and then transmits it on 915 mHz using a Hope RM12 module at a rate of about 50 reading per second. A separate micro-controller connected to a laptop via USB receives the data and transfers it to a serial port. A software program running on the same computer graphically displays the data as it is collected, and also saves it to disk for further analysis.

It contains an Atmel Atmega 328P, which has more memory and runs faster than my first computer (a Sinclair ZX-81). The JeeNode has a significantly smaller footprint than a standard Arduino, similar to Lady Ada\u2019s Boarduino, but also has an integrated Hope RM12B wireless module. Additionally, the JeeNode has the I/O pins grouped in to four \u201cPorts\u201d to facilitate standardizing sensor connections, and runs at 3.3V. JeeLabs has developed a number of sensor/breakout boards, called \"Plugs\" using the IC2 interface, meaning they can be piggybacked on to the same port, making the JeeNode extremely extendable. In addition to the hardware, JeeLabs provides a software library making the use of ports and assessing sensor data very easy. I used the following hardware, available in the U.S. from Modern Device (http://shop.moderndevice.com/ ) or elsewhere from JeeLabs (http://jeelabs.com/ ). \u00a0\u00a0*JeeNode Kit ($22.50) (a.k.a. \u201cTransmitter\u201d) \u00a0\u00a0*JeeLink Module ($36.50, assembled) (a.k.a. \u201cReceiver\u201d) \u00a0\u00a0*JeeLabs Pressure Plug ($21.95) Bosch BMP085 barometric pressure and temperature sensor. \u00a0\u00a0*USB BUB Board Kit ($14.00) or FTDI programming cable \u00a0\u00a0Optional: \u00a0\u00a0*JeeLabs Gravity Plug ($20.00) BMA020 3-axis accelerometer sensor \u00a0\u00a0*JeeLabs Memory Plug ($9.50) (1 x 128KB STMicroelectronics M24M01 EEPROM) For the full setup, you are in for about $125 + shipping. You could fly with just a Pressure Plug for altitude. You will also need batteries and a holder (I got mine at RadioShack). Consider this a small investment in your continuing Maker education. You only need one JeeLink and USB BUB. You can add or reuse as many JeeNodes as projects you dream up (or just type \u201cArduino\u201d in the Instructables search box). The sensors and Port library can also be used with a standard Arduino with some effort.Disclaimer: I do not work for or have financial interest in JeeLabs. In fact, I would have a hard time pointing to the Netherlands on a map. I have, however, worked with Jean-Claude\u2019s tech and find it well engineered, documented, and supported. Those are three requirements to get my hard earned money in my pursuit of hobby. I hope this sends more his way.Makers Solder : Each of the kits have instructions online and require some soldering. The sensors need headers soldered depending on how you position them. If you are unsure of your soldering skill, check out https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-solder/ . If you want to see what building the kit involves, check out http://jeelabs.org/2010/09/26/assembling-the-jeenode-v5/ . Once you build this, you can definitely claim you can solder. Hacking is all about mad skills. In my hardware configuration for the Transmitter, all the IC2 sensors are connected to Port 3, and I have a single LED and resistor hooked to the Port 4 digital & GND lines. Any variation from this layout can be easily accounted for in the Transmitter program by changing the Port numbers. I\u2019m powering the JeeNode using 2 x AA in a plastic RadioShack battery holder. The flight assembly weighs in at about 50g, of which a little less than half is battery. A light-weight lithium ion battery would be ideal for this, but because of the near constant radio operation, it would take a bit more than a CR2032 coin cell (yes, I tried).\u00a0", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F48/PAFT/GJQEGR3T/F48PAFTGJQEGR3T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F26/KTYG/GJQEGR3S/F26KTYGGJQEGR3S.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Hardware"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "[Updated October 2015]Since this Instructable was written (February 2011!), both Arduino and the JeeLabs software have progressed, leaving my code useless for a current installation.

And water is still pretty cheap around here at least, especially compared to pack of Estes motors and igniters.

This year will add yet another level of interest!DATA ACQUISITION: Each of the uploaded Arduino sketches can be tested using the serial monitor for the port they are connected to (connect the Transmit JeeNode via the USB BUB or FTDI when uploading or testing). Use the same key commands for all three points (Transmitter, Receiver, and Processing):\u201cc\u201d - clears the non-volatile data memory and zeros out the sensors. The rocket should be in the correct orientation for launch. Processing or Receiving should report \u201c0, 0, 0\u201d in the serial screen, where as Transmitter will display the information about the sensors. The Transmitter LED should flash once.\u201cw\u201d - (as in \u201cwrite\u201d) starts or stops transmission and recording of data. The LED on the Transmitter will be lit when recording and a message indicating status displayed on the serial. Receiver and Processing will show a stream of data start on the serial and Processing will start to graph the data. Press \u201cw\u201d again to stop the data flow or it will just keep collecting until the memory is full (~2100 readings, or about 42 seconds).\u201cr\u201d - (as in \u201creplay\u201d) plays back the recorded data from the non-volatile memory (if used). This will be essentially identical to the flight data, but will also contain any data that was lost in transmission if your rocket went out of range or experienced interference.My launch sequence has been to do a clear, write, and read sequence prior to putting the rocket on the pad to make sure everything is powered and functional (see video). I then set up the rocket on the pad and pressurize it. With Processing running, send the clear signal \u201cc\u201d, followed by the write signal \u201cw\u201d. As soon as data starts coming in, start your count down! Processing is tracking the last 400 readings and will show the minimum and maximum acceleration, altitude, and speed. Once the rocket lands, hit \u201cw\u201d again to stop the data flow. If you think you lost data during the flight, bring the Transmitter near the Receiver and hit \u201cr\u201d to retransmit the data.

From the read outs in the field, we see a quick (off scale) acceleration followed by an arcing altitude graph. The results are a bit higher than I would have guessed, but within reason. One approach to validating the numbers is theoretical. \u00a0Dean Wheeler has put a water-rocket simulator on-line that accounts for everything down to air temperature. To put it to use, you need to know some key parameters. My total rocket (minus water) weighed 185 grams. I used 0.7 L of water pressurized to 60 p.s.i. (there I go mixing units again). Using Dean's suggested drag coefficient, which is the primary unknown in all this, the number fall short of measured (268 feet verses 176 feet). The calculated flight time and time to apogee are also shorter. So, what is a good scientist to do? Right, massage the data. Since the drag coeeficent is the primary unknown, and all the other data seem scaled low, I adjusted it until the maximum altitude matched. The time to\u00a0apogee\u00a0and the total flight time are pretty close!\u00a0 (see the dotted lines in Figure 1) There was a lucky accident here. Did you catch it? The theoretical model assumes the rocket has no parachute on its return to earth. My parachute failed to open, allowing us to directly compare the total flight time. Of the four flights we made, only flights 1 and 4 provided data. The crash from the first flight fractured the battery holder so the\u00a0micro-controller\u00a0would loose power during the\u00a0acceleration, leaving an\u00a0eerie\u00a0end to data transmission. The final flight, the parachute, making up for past transgressions, opened to early, leaving a flight in my estimate of half as high as the first. Alas, nothing in science is as clear cut as you would like it to be. A measurement of the angle at apogee on the final flight put it's altitude at 60 feet, well below the indicated 120 feet. Some final observations on the data. The\u00a0calculated\u00a0maximum Gs are ~60! That would kill a human, and explains why I have a hard time keeping fins attached to the rocket body.

We went down to Alpine on President's Day and got off six flights (a $3 engine a pop) off. The first and last had the improved telemetry package (lighter battery and a high-range accelerometer), and the remainder with a cheapo spy camera .  In all, not too bad. I've got plans for a lighter, more powerful rocket so I can fly both the electronics and the video camera at the same time (we were over the recommended limit by a ways).

Our circuit diagram is shown above. This part of the circuit allows audio to be sampled and processed by the Arduino. The audio signal from the microphone goes into the circuit through an op amp circuit and DC offset circuit and then into the Arduino. Preparing the Audio Jack: In our circuit, we used the \u00bc-inch mono audio jack. Connect a wire to the ground pin of the mono jack, which is usually the larger pin on the jack. Then connect a wire to the one of the two signal pins of the mono jack, which are the smaller pins. In our own circuit, we used electrical tape, but you can solder the wires for a better connection.Building the Circuit: Refer to the circuit diagram above while constructing the circuit. The first step in the circuit is the amplifier. It increases the amplitude of the signal from around \u00b1200 mV to \u00b12.5 V. It also protects the audio source from the rest of the circuit. The 9 V batteries power the amplifier. Wire the +V and -V to the op amp. Wire the signal from the mono jack to the non-inverting input and connect the ground pin of the jack to the 0 V reference on your voltage supply (the junction between the two 9 V batteries in series). Wire a 100 kOhm resistor between the output and inverting input of the op amp. We used a 10 kOhm potentiometer as a variable resistor to adjust the gain of the op amp. The gain is the amplitude of the output voltage divided by the amplitude of the input voltage. Wire the potentiometer between the inverting input and the 0 V reference. You can adjust the potentiometer to adjust the gain of the amplifier based on the sensitivity of the microphone while keeping it in an acceptable range for the Arduino, which is 0 to 5 V.DC Offset: The +2.5 V DC offset causes the audio signal to oscillate around 2.5 V so that it stays within the acceptable range (0 - 5 V) for the Arduino\u2019s analog inputs. The DC offset circuit has two main components: a voltage divider and a capacitor. Our voltage divider is made from two 100k resistors wired in series from the Arduino\u2019s 5 V supply to ground. Because the resistors have the same resistance, the voltage at the junction between them equals 2.5 V. This 2.5 V node is tied to the output of the amplifier with a 10 \u03bcF capacitor.

Test that the microphone is reading any sound and that the code is printing the corresponding frequencies to the serial monitor in the Arduino programming environment. Use your voice as a sound source for this phase of testing by speaking into the microphone. In our project, we ran into some trouble when wiring the microphone. Make sure you are using the proper channels on the microphone.2. Test that your device is detecting specific frequencies properly. Hold the microphone 4 - 6 inches from the acoustic guitar strings and check that the displayed frequency in the serial monitor matches the expected frequency by playing each note.Above are sample tests from determining what ampThreshold value to use. If you are running into problems detecting certain frequencies, try changing some of the threshold values. Two tests were recorded with the threshold value of 20 and one test was recorded with the Threshold value of 25. As you can see from the diagrams above, the circuit struggled to detect notes at higher frequencies. To eliminate some of the static, make sure you are testing in a quiet room with little to no surrounding noise.  3. Test that the seven segment display and associated LEDs are displaying the correct note. Repeat Test 2, but this time look at the seven segment display for feedback, as opposed to the serial monitor.

So the plan of action is to first connect the sensor and set up everything to acquire the signals from the ECG sensor. When we have the data we want, this can be used to plot a graph of the heartbeat. Now this graph will be used to make our gift!All of this might sound somewhat complicated, but I promise its pretty straight forwards - and I'll show you how!The bitalino comes with an arduino, bluetooth module, battery charger, and sensors for measuring:Electromyography - muscle activityElectrodermal activity - Skin conductivityAnd Electrocardiogram - or heartbeats, along with pre-gelled electrodes. This is what we're interested in!The kit is kind of expensive so make sure you either really like the gift recipient, or you really want to experiment with these sensors. What I like about the bitalino kit is how it takes a bunch of really advanced sensors, and puts it in the hands of DIY enthusiasts. From the start it's pretty much plug and play, as the arduino comes preloaded with the necessary firmware. So no need to upload your own sketch, unless you want to of course!If you want to write your own arduino sketch, you probably already know how to if you've played around with an arduino and basic sensors! If that's something you would like to brush up on do a quick read through on this page.While we get complex information out from the ECG sensor, acquiring the sensor information itself is easy! The sensor will send analog signals to the arduino. So you can break away the sensor and connect it to any of the analog input pins on any type of arduino. As usual you will get analog values represented digitally in 10 bits. That is to say, the analog values on the input vary between 0 and 1023 (2^10). Really like any type of analog sensor being read to a micro controller.To get a smooth looking graph you should sample the sensor data at about 10,000Hz. That is ten-thousand times each second. This is easily done by adjusting the delay between each analogRead function in your arduino sketch. To get 10,000Hz you should use this delay: delayMicroseconds(100);If you transfet the sensor data over the serial connection, use a baudrate of 115200.Out of the box the bitalino kit comes pre-loaded with firmware to broadcast the sensors information over bluetooth.

We only need something simple for this porject, and that is for a program to snap up the bluetooth signals sent by the bitalino and saves them as a .txt file. Nothing fancy, just acquire and save signals!OpenSignals is a free signal processing tool. This is made to receive the data sent by the arduino over bluetooth in the bitalino kit. If you use on of the three most common operating system you're in luck, as this software suite is supported on Windows, Mac OS X, and even Linux! Click here to download OpenSignals.If you have an Android phone you could also check out BITadroid. I didn't find a specific app for iPhone, but all you need is an app to be able to connect to an arduino over bluetooth and save data sent over the serial connection. Now turn on the bluetooth on the bitalino, it's as easy as connecting the battery and toggling the only switch you can find on the board. Turn on the bluetooth on your computer or phone and start searching for nearby devices. The sensor kit shows up as bitalino in the list of available devices. Choose this one and enter the password which is 1234, that should be easy enough to remember!Now open up opensignals and see if it can find your device. When it does you can test out the bluetooth connection by going into the recording option on opensignals. Shake the bitalino board around.

I have connected the same electrodes about 10 times to my chest while making and testing this project. The electrodes are starting to loose some of their glue now.

What I did was to graph the data in excel and then make a poster in photoshop with an old school graph, some symbolism, and space to write a nice poem I knew she liked. That's just one way of visualizing, you choose what you think is the best way for you. To give you some examples:At first I thought about 3D printing a phone case with the heartbeat, so my heartbeat would always be close by her. Then I considered 3D printing the heartbeat, and then use it as a stamp on any leather items like purses, keychains, or pencil cases. If you're wondering how in the world to turn a picture into a 3D printable object, you can either export the graph from excel or screenshot the graph in opensignals. Then take a look at this instructable by snifikino on how to 3D print photos.If you want to use the poster template I made, you can download it here in both .psd and .pdf format. This means you can open up and edit the template in most available photo editing software! I made the poster template in A3 size (11 x 17\u2033 in the US), and with 600 dpi. This means it can be scaled quite big or as small as you want! Most schools and offices has printers that can print in A3 size or even bigger.Heres how to graph the sensor data in excel. Open up the program and go into Data and then From text. Now locate the .txt file you saved with your heartbeat, choose Import. Change the value for Start import at row: to 4, this is where the sensor data starts. Now you can click Finish and select where excel should plot the data.To select the heartbeat data go into the sixth column which is labeled F. Press on the F to select all the data in this column. Go to Insert and under recommended charts choose one of the 2D Charts. Thiswill give a pretty standard looking ECG plot. Note that if the graph looks to messy you might have selected too much data. To remedy this, simply select less data from the F column before making a new plot. Remember that the bitalino sent 10,000 samples each second. Which means 10,000 rows in excel correspond to 1 second of your heartbeat. To get the graph into photoshop/gimp, select the graph and click on File > Export > Create PDF/XPS. Save the pdf somewhere you remember and simply drag it into your editing software on top of the template you can download from this step. I printed the graph on a textured and thick cardstock. This gives the final poster a much nicer feel. After printing the poster was cut and trimmed to a smaller size. I drew a 1cm (0.4 in) border around the printed border and used this as a cutting guide along with a ruler and a sharp hobby knife. While cutting thick paper and cardstock it's a good idea to do several passes with the knife along the cut, not force the knife through the paper all at once. Doing several of these light passes with the knife gives cleaner edge, and we want our hard work to look as nice as possible!When the poster was cut I mixed up some coffe and tea in a cup and used this to wash over the paper. This makes the paper take on a brownish-yellow color you often see on old paper. I really like this looked. Now if you're going to write anything on your poster, make sure you do this after you've washed the paper and let it dry. If you write something with a pen or pencil before washing the paper, your nice handwriting will wash all over the page making it smudged and hard to read.

It will find the minimum VSWR and corresponding frequency for each band but also will display a realtime VSWR for a user-selected frequency to facilitate antenna adjustment. If sweeping a single frequency band, it will display a graph of VSWR versus frequency. It also has a USB port on the back for outputting frequency and VSWR data, to allow more refined graph-plotting on a PC. The USB port can also be used to reflash the firmware if needed. I recently got into amateur radio (because I liked the idea of peer-to-peer communication over huge distances without infrastructure) and rapidly made the following observations:1. All of the worldwide communications that interested me take place on the HF bands (3-30 MHz)2. HF transceivers are very expensive and will break if you don't drive them into a reasonably well-matched antenna3. You are generally expected to rig up your own HF antenna from bits of wire strung across the garden (unless you want to spend even more money than you spent in 2).4. Your antenna might be a bad match but you won't know till you try it.Now a purist would probably say that one should first test the antenna on very low power at the frequency of interest and check the VSWR on the rig's meter to assess the quality of the match. I don't really have the time to muck about with that sort of thing for every frequency I might want to use. What I really wanted was an antenna analyser. These devices can test the quality of the antenna match at any frequency over the HF bands. Unfortunately they are also very expensive, so I set about considering whether I could make my own. I stumbled upon the excellent work carried out by K6BEZ (see http://www.hamstack.com/project_antenna_analyzer.html), who investigated the use of an Arduino to control a cheap direct digital synthesiser module (DDS). He soon abandoned the Arduino on cost grounds, preferring to use a PIC. Well, in 2017 you can buy an Arduino Nano for about \u00a33.50, so I thought it was time to revisit his work, pick up where he left off and see what I could come up with (note that I'm not the only one who has done this: there are some very nice examples to be found on the internet).Update (29/7/2018) - this work has been built upon considerably by bi3qwq, from China, who has made some really nice improvements to the user interface, which he has kindly shared. He's designed a very professional PCB (with a great calibration resistor feature) and done a really good looking build. To top it all he has prepared a schematic, which I know will delight many of those who have commented previously. Please see the comments section for more information.Update - I've been getting into 60 m recently, which the original sketch didn't cover. So now I've uploaded firmware version 7, which adds the 160 m and 60 m bands. These aren't add-ons; they are fully integrated into the operation of the analyser. It was fortunate that I could find an u8glib font that was still legible but allowed me to display ten bands simultaneously on that little screen (although it wasn't monospace, which caused some grief). I have estimated calibration values for the new bands, based on interpolation / extrapolation of the existing calibration values. I then checked these out with fixed resistors and they give pretty good results.Update - as several people have asked about schematics, the fundamental Arduino / DDS / VSWR bridge circuit is largely unaltered from K6BEZ's original work. Please check out the above URL for his original schematic on which I based this project. I've added an encoder, an OLED screen and fully developed firmware to make for an effortless user experience.Update - This system uses a very low voltage DDS signal source in conjunction with a resistive bridge containing diode detectors. Thus the diodes are operating in their non-linear regions and my first version of this system tended to under-read VSWR. As an example, a 16 ohm or 160 ohm impedance load should show a VSWR of about 3 in a 50 ohm system; this meter indicated a VSWR closer to 2 in this situation. I therefore carried out a software calibration using known loads which seems to be an effective fix for this problem. This is described in the penultimate step of this instructable and a revised sketch has been uploaded.Update - on-board graphing facility added to single sweeps as it was too useful to leave out, particularly when tuning antenna lengths for minimum VSWR : a graph gives you an instantly visible trend.", "title": "HF Antenna Analyser With Arduino and DDS Module", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/HF-Antenna-Analyser-With-Arduino-and-DDS-Module/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "You will need the following items.

Every intersection represents a stripboard hole. The copper tracks go horizontally. A cross represents a broken track (use a 6 mm drill or the proper tool if you have one). Lines of circles with a box round them represent headers. Large boxes with screws denote the connector blocks. Note that in my diagram there is an extra line which runs horizontally through the middle of the board. Leave this out when you are putting it together (it's marked 'omit this line').Some of the components may appear to be laid out strangely. This is because the design evolved once I'd got the basic hardware working (particularly when I realised that the encoder needed hardware interrupts, for example).When soldering components onto the board, I use Blu-Tak to hold them in firmly in place while I turn the board over to solder the legs.I tried to minimise the amount of wire I used by aligning the Arduino and the DDS module and just using the stripboard to connect key pins. I didn't realise at the time that the hardware interrupts needed to read the encoder only work on pins D2 and D3, so I had to move DDS RESET from its original D3 connection with a bit of wire:DDS RESET - Arduino D7DDS SDAT - Arduino D4DDS FQ.UD - Arduino D5DDS SCLK - Arduino D6Arduino D2 & D3 are used for the encoder inputs A & B.

Use self-adhesive PCB standoffs for mounting the stripboard. They make life really easy.2. Use a short USB adaptor lead to bring out the Arduino USB port to the rear of the enclosure. Then it's easy to access the serial port to obtain frequency vs. VSWR data and also to reflash the Arduino without taking the lid off.3.

This meant that although an antenna appeared to be okay, my rig's autotuner wasn't able to match to it. This problem arises because the DDS module gives out a very low amplitude signal (about 0.5 Vpp at 3.5 MHz, rolling off as frequency increases). The detector diodes in the VSWR bridge are therefore operating in their non-linear region.There are two possible fixes for this. The first is to fit an broadband amplifier to the output of the DDS. Potentially suitable devices are available cheaply from China and they will boost the output to about 2 V pp. I have ordered one of these but have yet to try it. My feeling is that even this amplitude will be a bit marginal and some non-linearity will remain. The second method is to put known loads on the output of the existing meter and to record the displayed VSWR at each frequency band. This allows you to construct correction curves for actual versus reported VSWR, which can then be put into the Arduino sketch to apply correction on the fly. I adopted the second method as it was easy to do. Just get hold of the following resistors: 50, 100, 150 and 200 ohms. On this 50 ohm instrument these will correspond to VSWRs of 1,2,3 and 4 by definition. In the sketch there is a switch 'use_calibration'. Set this to LOW and upload the sketch (which will display a warning on the splash screen). Then carry out measurements at the centre of each frequency band for each resistor. Use a spreadsheet to plot expected versus displayed VSWR. You can then do a logarithmic curve fit for each frequency band, which gives a multiplier and intercept of the form TrueVSWR=m.ln(MeasuredVSWR)+c. These values should be loaded into the swr_results array in the last two columns (see the preceding comment statement in the sketch). This is an odd place to put them but I was in a hurry and as this array stores floats it seemed like a sensible choice at the time. Then put the use_calibration switch back to HIGH, reflash the Arduino and off you go.Note that when doing the spot frequency measurements, the calibration is applied for the initial choice of band. This won't be updated if you make gross changes in frequency.Now the meter reads as expected for the fixed loads and seems to make sense when measuring my antennas! I suspect I may not bother trying that broadband amp out when it arrives...", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FOO/F7RM/J1QP3L37/FOOF7RMJ1QP3L37.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Calibration"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Attach an antenna via a PL-259 lead and switch the device on. It will display a splash screen then automatically perform a sweep of all the main HF bands. The display shows the frequency under test, the current VSWR reading, the minimum VSWR reading and the frequency at which it occurred. In order to reduce measurement noise, five measurements are taken of VSWR at every frequency point; the mean value of these five readings is then passed through a nine-point moving average filter with respect to frequency before the final value is displayed.If you want to stop this all-bands sweep, just press the encoder knob. The sweep will stop and a summary of all the band data gathered will be displayed (with nulls for those bands not yet swept). A second press will bring up the main menu. Choices are made by rotating the encoder and then pressing it at the appropriate point. There are three choices in the main menu:Sweep all bands will restart the sweep of all the main HF bands. When it finishes, it will display the summary screen described above. Write this down or take a photo if you want to keep it.Sweep single band will allow you to select a single band with the encoder then sweep it. Both the wavelength and frequency range are displayed while making the selection. When the sweep has finished, a second press of the encoder will display a simple VSWR versus frequency graph of the band just swept, with a numerical indication of minimum VSWR and the frequency that it occurred. This is very handy if you want to know whether to shorten or lengthen your dipole arms, as it shows the VSWR trend with frequency; this is lost with the simple numeric report.Single frequency allows you to choose a single fixed frequency and then continuously updates a live VSWR measurement, for antenna tuning purposes in real time. First select the relevant frequency band; the display will then show the centre frequency of the chosen band and a live VSWR reading. The relevant band calibration is applied at this point. One of the digits of the frequency will be underlined. This can be moved left and right with the encoder. Pressing the encoder emboldens the line; then rotating the encoder will reduce or increase the digit (0-9 with no wrap or carry). Press the encoder again to fix the digit, then go on to the next one. You can access pretty much any frequency across the entire HF spectrum using this facility - the band selection at the start just helps to get you close to where you probably want to be. There's a caveat though: the calibration for the selected band is loaded at the start. If you move too far away from the selected band by changing the digits the calibration will become less valid, so try to stay within the chosen band. When you have finished with this mode, move the underscore all the way to the right until it's under 'exit', then press the encoder to return to the main menu.If you connect your PC to the USB socket on the rear of the analyser (i.e. into the Arduino), you can use the Arduino serial monitor to collect frequency versus VSWR values during any sweep operation (it's currently set to 9600 but you can change that easily by editing my sketch).

With this way of thinking, I decided to build a homebrew Arduino Oscilloscope. This instructable was written with the purpose of teaching a bit about microcontrollers and data acquisition. This is an extreme project because I wanted to squeeze out from Arduino as much velocity as I could, I have not seen any other Arduino Oscilloscope as fast as this one.\nSome time ago I was working on an Arduino project and I needed to see if the output signal was into compliance with the specifics. Thus I spent some time on the internet looking for Arduino Oscilloscopes already implemented, but I did not like what I found.\u00a0The projects that I found were mostly composed of a Graphical User Interface for the computer written in Processing and a very simple arduino sketch. The sketches were something like:\n\n\tvoid setup() {\n\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Serial.begin(9600);\n\t}\n\tvoid loop() {\n\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0int val = analogRead(ANALOG_IN);\n\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Serial.println(val);\n\t}\nThis approach is not wrong and I do not want to insult anyone, but this is too slow for me. The serial port is slow and sending every result of an analogRead() through it is a bottleneck.\nI have been studying Waveform Digitizers for some time and I know reasonably well how do they work, so I got inspiration from them. These were the starting points of the oscilloscope that I wanted to create:\n\n\t\tthe incoming signal should be decoupled from the arduino to preserve it;\n\t\twith an offset of the signal it is possible to see negative signals;\n\t\tthe data should be buffered;\n\t\ta hardware trigger is required to catch the signals;\n\t\ta circular buffer can give the signal shape prior to the trigger (more to follow on this point);\n\t\tusing lower lever functions that the standard ones makes the program run faster.\nThe sketch for the Arduino is attached to this step, along with the schematic of the circuit that I made.\nThe name that I came up with, Girino, is a frivolous pun in Italian.

Also each meaningful bit of the registers has a name, like ADEN for the ADC Enable Bit in the ADCSRA register.\nTo set their bits we could use the usual C syntax for binary algebra, but I found on the internet a couple of macros that are very nice and clean:\n\n\t\t// Defines for setting and clearing register bits\n\t\t#ifndef cbi\n\t\t#define cbi(sfr, bit) (_SFR_BYTE(sfr) &= ~_BV(bit))\n\t\t#endif\n\t\t#ifndef sbi\n\t\t#define sbi(sfr, bit) (_SFR_BYTE(sfr) |= _BV(bit))\n\t\t#endif\n\tUsing them is very simple, if we want to set to 1 the Enable Bit of the ADC we can just write:\n\t\tsbi(ADCSRA,ADEN);\n\tWhile if we want to set it to 0 (id est clear it) we can just write:\n\t\tcbi(ADCSRA,ADEN);", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8T/X9ES/GZLW4ES1/F8TX9ESGZLW4ES1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBA/3NQ9/GZLW97EP/FBA3NQ9GZLW97EP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Setting Register Bits"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "\n          As we will see in the next steps, the use of interrupts is required in this project. Interrupts are signals that tell the microcontroller to stop the execution of the main loop and pass it to some special functions. The images give an idea of the program flow.\nThe functions that are executed are called Interrupt Service Routines (ISR) and are more or less simple functions, but that do not take arguments.\nLet us see an example, something like counting some pulses. The ATMega328P has an Analog Comparator that has an interrupt associated that is activated when a signal surpasses a reference voltage. First of all you must define the function that will be exectuted:\n\n\t\tISR(ANALOG_COMP_vect)\n\t\t{\n\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 counter++;\n\t\t}\nThis is really simple, the instruction ISR() is a macro that tells the compiler that the following function is an Interrupt Service Routine. While ANALOG_COMP_vect is called Interrupt Vector and it tells the compiler which interrupt is associated to that routine. In this case it is the Analog Comparator Interrupt. So everytime that the comparator sees a signal bigger than a reference it tells the microcontroller to execute that code, id est in this case to increment that variable.\nThe next step is to enable the interrupt associated. To enable it we must set the ACIE (Analog Comparator Interrupt Enable) bit of the ACSR (Analog Comparator Setting Register) register:\n\n\t\tsbi(ACSR,ACIE);\n\tIn the following site we can see the list of all Interrupt Vectors:http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/group__avr__interrupts.html", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FDF/1QWH/GZLW99GQ/FDF1QWHGZLW99GQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDQ/C2E2/GZMIUKWM/FDQC2E2GZMIUKWM.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: What Are the Interrupts"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "\n          The concept of using a Circular Buffer is pretty straight forward:\nAcquire continuously till a signal is found, then send the digitized signal to the computer.\n\tThis approach allows to have the incoming signal shape also before the trigger event.\nI prepared some diagrams to make myself clear. The following points are referring to the images.\n\n\t\tOn the first image we can see what I mean with continuous acquisition. We define a buffer that will store the data, in my case an array with 1280 slots, then we start to continuously read the ADC output register (ADCH) ad filling the buffer with the data. When we get to the end of the buffer we restart from the beggining without clearing it. If we immagine the array arranged in a circular way it is easy to see what I mean.\n\t\tWhen the signal surpasses the threshold, the Analog Comparator Interrupt is activated. Then we start a waiting phase in which we continue to acquire the signal but keep a count of the ADC cycles that passed from the Analog Comparator Interrupt.\n\t\tWhen we waited for N cycles (with N < 1280), we freeze the situation and stop the ADC cycles. So we end up with a buffer filled with the digitization of the signal temporal shape. The great part of this, is that we have also the shape prior to the trigger event, because we were already acquiring before that.\n\t\tNow we can send the whole buffer to the serial port in a block of binary data, instead of sending the single ADC reads.

It has an internal trigger that is able to show the signal always on the same position of the screen (or at least most of the times), creating the illusion of a stable plot.\nThe trigger is associated with a threshold that activates a sweep when the signal passes it. A sweep is the phase in which the oscilloscope records and displays the signal. After a sweep another phase occurs: the holdoff, in which the oscilloscope rejects any incoming signal. The holdoff period can be composed of a part of dead time, in which the oscilloscope is unable to accept any signal, and a part that can be user selectable. The dead time can be caused by various reasons like having to draw on the screen or having to store the data somewhere.\nLooking at the image we get a sense of what happens.\n\n\t\tSignal 1 surpasses the threshold and activates the sweep;\n\t\tsignal 2 is inside the sweep time and gets caught with the first;\n\t\tafter the holdoff, signal 3 activates the sweep again;\n\t\tinstead signal 4 is rejected because it falls inside the holdoff region.\nThe raison d'\u00eatre of the holdoff phase is to prevent some undesired signals to get in the sweep region. It is a little bit long to explain this point and it eludes the purpose of this instructable.\nThe moral of this story is that we need:\n\n\t\ta threshold level to wich we can compare the incoming signal;\n\t\ta signal that tells the microcontroller to start the waiting phase (see preceding step).\nWe have several possible solutions for point 1. :\n\n\t\tusing a trimmer we can manually set a voltage level;\n\t\tusing the PWM of the Arduino we can set the level by software;\n\t\tusing the 3.3 V provided by the Arduino itself;\n\t\tusing the internal bangap reference we can use a fixed level.\nFor point 2. we have the right solution: we can use the interrupt of the internal Analog Comparator of the microcontroller.\n        ", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FYJ/6VUX/GZPZMFFH/FYJ6VUXGZPZMFFH.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Oscilloscope Triggering"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "\n          The Arduino microcontroller features a single 10-bit successive approximation ADC. Before the ADC there is an analog multiplexer that lets us send, to the ADC,\u00a0the signals from different pins and sources (but only one at a time).Successive Approximation ADC means that the ADC takes 13 clock cycles to complete the conversion (and 25 clock cycles for the first conversion). There is a clock signal dedicated to the ADC that is \"computed\" from the main clock of the Arduino; this is because the ADC is a little slow and can not keep up with the pace of the other parts of the microcontroller. It requires an input clock frequency between 50 kHz and 200 kHz to get maximum resolution. If a lower resolution than 10 bits is needed, the input clock frequency to the ADC can be higher than 200 kHz to get a higher sample rate.\nBut how much higher rates can we use? There are a couple of good guides about the ADC at the Open Music Labs that I suggest to read:\nhttp://www.openmusiclabs.com/learning/digital/atmega-adc/http://www.openmusiclabs.com/learning/digital/atmega-adc/in-depth/\nSince my purpose is to get a fast oscilloscope I decided to limit the precision to 8-bits. This has several bonuses:\n\n\t\tthe data buffer can store more data;\n\t\tyou do not waste 6-bits of RAM per datum;\n\t\tthe ADC can acquire faster.\nThe prescaler lets us divide the frequency, by some factors, by setting the ADPS0-1-2 bits of the ADCSRA register. Seeing the plot of the precision from the Open Music Labs Article, we can see that for 8-bits precision the frequency could go up to 1.5 MHz, good! But since the ability of changing the prescaler factor lets us change the acquisition rate, we can use it also to change the timescale of the oscilloscope.\nThere is a good feature about the output registers: we can decide the adjusting of conversion bits, by setting the ADLAR bit in the ADMUX register. If it is 0 they are right adjusted and viceversa (see the image). Since I wanted 8-bits precision I set it to 1 so I could read just the ADCH register and ignore the ADCL.\nI decided to have just one input channel to avoid having to switch channel back and forth at every conversion.\nOne last thing about the ADC, it has different running modes each one with a different trigger source:\n\n\t\tFree Running mode\n\t\tAnalog Comparator\n\t\tExternal Interrupt Request 0\n\t\tTimer/Counter0 Compare Match A\n\t\tTimer/Counter0 Overflow\n\t\tTimer/Counter1 Compare Match B\n\t\tTimer/Counter1 Overflow\n\t\tTimer/Counter1 Capture Event\nI was interested in the free running mode that is a mode in which the ADC continuously converts the input and throws an Interrupt at the end of each conversion (associated vector:\u00a0ADC_vect).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFU/6Y34/GZQR1BVN/FFU6Y34GZQR1BVN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM2/0IGY/GZPZME5W/FM20IGYGZPZME5W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA2/MS3S/GZQ40KO6/FA2MS3SGZQ40KO6.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: How the ADC Works"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "\n          The analog input pins of the Arduino can also be used as digital I/O pins, therefore they have an input buffer for digital functions.

PWM signals (more on this to follow) are square signals with a constant frequency but a variable pulse-width. This variability brings a variable mean value of the signal that can be extracted with a low-pass filter. A good cutoff frequency for the filter is about one hundredth of the PWM frequency and I chose about 560 Hz.\nAfter the two threshold sources I inserted a couple of pins that allows to select, with a jumper, which source I wanted. After the selection I also added an emitter follower to decouple the sources from the Arduino pin.\n        ", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F1Y/7HHJ/GZUA8XAV/F1Y7HHJGZUA8XAV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 13: Threshold"}, {"step": 14, "steps_text": "\n          As stated before, a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal is a square signal with fixed frequency but variable width. On the image we see an example. On each row there is one of such signals with a different duty cycle (id est the period portion in which the signal is High). Taking the mean signal over a period, we get the red line that correspond to the duty cycle with respect to the signal maximum.\nElectronically \"taking the mean of a signal\" can be translated to \"passing it to a low-pass filter\", as seen on the preceding step.\nHow does the Arduino generate a PWM signal? There is a really good tutorial about PWM here:http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/SecretsOfArduinoPWM\nWe will see just the points that are needed for this project.\nIn the ATMega328P there are three timers that can be used to generate PWM signals, each one of those has different characteristics that you can use. For each timer correspond two registers called\u00a0Output Compare Registers A/B\u00a0(OCRnx) that are used to set the signal duty cycle.\nAs for the ADC there is a prescaler (see image), that slows down the main clock to have a precise control of the PWM frequency. The slowed down clock is fed to a counter that increments a Timer/Counter Register (TCNTn). This register is continuously compared to the OCRnx, when they are equal a signal is sent to a Waveform Generator that generate a pulse on the output pin. So the trick is setting the OCRnx register to some value to change the mean value of the signal.\nIf we want a 5 V signal (maximum) we must set a 100% duty cycle or a 255 in the OCRnx (maximum for a 8-bit number), while if we want a 0.5 V signal we must set a 10% duty cycle or a 25 in the OCRnx.\nSince the clock has to fill the TCNTn register before starting from the beginning for a new pulse the output frequency of the PWM is:\n\n\t\tf = (Main clock) / prescaler / (TCNTn maximum)exempli gratia for the Timer 0 and 2 (8-bit) with no prescaler it will be: 16 MHz / 256 = 62.5 KHz while for Timer 1 (16-bit) it will be 16 MHz / 65536 = 244 Hz.\nI decided to use the Timer number 2 because\n\n\t\tTimer 0\u00a0is used internally by the Arduino IDE for functions such as millis();\n\t\tTimer 1 has an output frequency too slow because it is a 16-bit timer.\nIn the ATMega328P there are different kinds of operation mode of the timers, but what I wanted was the Fast PWM one with no prescaling to get the maximum possible output frequency.\n        ", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FOA/VZS3/GZQR3MLC/FOAVZS3GZQR3MLC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1C/JRSF/GZPZMIJW/F1CJRSFGZPZMIJW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 14: How the Pulse Width Modulation Works"}, {"step": 15, "steps_text": "In the sketch, I wrote another initialization function that sets-up all the parameters of the Timer functioning and initializes a couple of pins.\n\n\tvoid initPins(void)\n\t{\n\t\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 //---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\t\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 // TCCR2A settings\n\t\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 //---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\t\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 // These bits control the Output Compare pin (OC2A) behavior.

I want to build and test rockets!\"That's what my oldest son told me when we began discussing what he wanted to do for his school science fair project this year. During a class launch last year he had noticed that some rockets appeared to launch faster than others and they were all using the same rocket engine so he thought some rockets must be heavier than others or maybe the fins made a difference. For his science fair project this year what he wanted to learn about was acceleration and prove that a heavier rocket would accelerate less quickly than a lighter weight rocket. In order to prove his hypothesis we needed to build a rocket and launch system where the only variable would be the mass of the rocket. We thought about using traditional solid propellant rocket motors but we had not devised a method of testing the motors to ensure the consistency of motor power output. For this reason we decided to use compressed air as a power source since we could accurately monitor the air pressure in the air launcher. We also liked the idea of air rockets as some solid propellant rockets that can carry a payload can reach very high altitudes and we were concerned with the possibility of losing a rocket and our data.In order to measure the acceleration during each launch we made a very simple circuit using a three axis accelerometer with a range of +/- 16g. The data from the accelerometer was logged on a micro SD card during launch so we could analyze it later. This way we could launch over and over again during one launch session in order to try and remove weather as a variable.This is a great project for introducing kids to the scientific process, coding, electronics, soldering and making rockets. The rockets are very inexpensive to make and once the launcher is built they cost nothing to launch and you can launch them over and over again in a very small field.This project does require the use of a soldering iron and sharp cutting tools so be sure to take the necessary safety precautions when assembling the rocket, launcher and circuit.Now let's gather our materials and build some rockets!", "title": "Science Fair Air Rockets", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Science-Fair-Air-Rockets/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "In order to build our rocket and launcher we're going to need a few items.

Gravity is our only recovery system...Since our rocket is air powered it needs to precisely fit our launch tube and that means making our own wound paper tubes. Thankfully there's an awesome Instructable for that!The only modification we need when making our tubes is to first cover the launch tube with three layers of paper before wrapping our three final tube layers- do not glue the first three layers as these will be removed later. The reason for these additional layers is when the glue dries the tube will shrink a fair bit. If you don't account for this shrinkage with additional layers first the finished paper tube will be too small to slide easily over the launch tube. We found the easiest way to cut the paper into accurate width strips is to get a large ruler or wide piece of rigid material to use as a guide with a rotary cutter. By using a 2\" wide Aluminum ruler we could cut perfect width strips very quickly. This makes a huge difference in the ease of wrapping the paper tubes since the paper strips were extremely consistent in width. Three layers of wrapped paper makes for a reasonably strong and light weight tube.Once the finished tube is dry it can be slid off the 3/4\" PVC pipe after trimming the ends with a knife. Then you just reach in the end of the tube and pull out the three under layers. The finished tube should be a perfect fit on the launch tube and its inside diameter is just large enough to fit the data logger circuit.Once the rocket body tube is made it needs to be cut in order to create a payload section. We cut the payload section to a length of 5 1/2\" and the main body tube to a length of 7\". The length of these sections isn't super critical. The payload section is attached to the main rocket body tube with a 2 1/2\" long solid balsa wood coupler/plug. The plug slides into each tube section and is glued to the top of the lower body tube and the bottom of the payload section. This plug is what the high pressure air from the launcher pushes against in order to force the rocket off the launch tube. A solid balsa nose cone is then fitted to the top of the payload section. We made the nose cone a total length of 3\" with almost 1\" fitting inside the top of the payload section. The nose cone should be a very snug fit.You can buy all kinds of balsa nose cones and couplers but I turned ours from balsa wood blocks using a lathe. Carving nose cones and couplers from insulation foam would also be an option.We cut the fins from 3/32\" thick balsa sheet and glued them to the main tube using super glue followed by filling any gaps with white glue. We decided to use four fins vs. three in hopes of obtaining more stable launches. The pattern for the fins came from the Juno rocket here. The finished weight of our rocket is 30 grams.

The most important change we made was to add a pressure gauge to read the air pressure in the air chamber. Being able to read the air pressure in the chamber means we can get very consistent launch power.The main body of the launcher is made from a 16\" long section of 2\" schedule 40 PVC pipe. A 2\" coupler with a plug cap is fitted to each end of the main body. When cementing the PVC pieces together be sure to use a primer to prep the joints before applying PVC cement. One of the plug caps has a short length of schedule 40 3/4\" PVC fitted and then a 3/4\" Tee is fitted to the 3/4\" pipe. Another short length of 3/4\" pipe is fitted to the opposite side of the Tee and this is fitted to a 3/4\" threaded fitting that attaches to the inline sprinkler valve. The opposite side of the sprinkler valve has a threaded 3/4\" slip fitting with a 16\" long schedule 40 PVC pipe for the launch tube.The other 2\" PVC plug cap has 3/4\" slip x 1/2\" female thread fitting attached. A 1/2\" x 1/4\"  threaded adapter is then used to attach a 1/4\" threaded hose barb to the 2\" plug cap. A 1/4\" ID high pressure hose is then secured to the hose barb with a hose clamp and a bicycle tire valve is fit to the other end of the hose with a second hose clamp. I cut the tire valve out of a spare bicycle inner tube I had in my garage.The finished launcher is wrapped with duct tape for protection in case the PVC pipe should ever fail under pressure.The sprinkler valve is powered using 8 \"AA\" batteries so when a button is pressed the sprinkler valve is actuated and the air shoots out the launch tube. The battery packs are connected in series to make a 12V power source. The positive wire from the battery pack goes to one wire of the sprinkler valve. The other sprinkler valve wire is connected to the launcher push button switch with a long wire. Another long wire connects the push button switch to the battery pack negative wire so when the launcher push button switch is pressed it completes the circuit. The air launcher is attached to an old telescope tripod I had on hand using large zip ties. Update:I found an Aluminum project box in a dumpster along with a key switch so I mounted the \"AA\" battery holders in the box and wired the key switch in series with the launch push button. This way it's harder to trigger a launch by accident and it looks a lot nicer than before.

Since it's such a simple circuit it's a good first project for learning how to solder. The circuit is based around a 3.3V Arduino Pro Mini, an Adafruit ADXL 326 analog accelerometer and a Sparkfun OpenLog. The Pro Mini reads the output from the accelerometer and the OpenLog records the data on a micro SD card.In order to keep the circuit as small and light weight as possible the OpenLog and accelerometer were connected directly to the Pro Mini using pin headers and a small two row section of prototyping board. We took the male seven pin header that shipped with the accelerometer board and soldered the prototyping board directly to the analog input pins on the Pro Mini. We began with pin 13 and soldered all seven pins. Next we soldered a seven pin female machine pin header on the next row of holes on the prototyping board. The female machine pin header is oriented so the accelerometer board is situated underneath the Pro Mini.Now we bridged four pins from the female header to the pins soldered to the Pro Mini- these pins connect the accelerometer X axis to analog in pin 0, Y axis to analog in pin 1, Z axis to analog in pin 2 and the accelerometer 3V pin to VCC on the Pro Mini. The GND pin from the accelerometer is connected to the GND pin on the opposite side of the Pro Mini with a short length of wire.Next we soldered a six pin female machine pin header to the top of the Pro Mini- this is used to connect the Open Log to the Pro Mini and it's also used as a programming port. We soldered male machine pin headers to the OpenLog and accelerometer board. I really like these machine pin headers as they are very low profile and they have a very solid connection compared to standard headers.Finally we soldered a battery connector to the Pro Mini. This was made with short lengths of wire and a two pin female machine pin header. These wires were soldered to the pins marked GND and RAW on the Pro Mini. The ends of the wires at the pin header were covered with heat shrink tubing for protection. The JST connector was cut from the LiPo battery leads (don't throw it away!) and a matching male pin header was soldered to the battery leads and they too were covered with heat shrink tubing. I ended up shortening the battery leads quite a bit to save weight and space. Note that when the data logger is placed in the rocket the X axis arrow on the accelerometer needs to point up in order for it to work properly.To charge the battery a matching two pin female connector was soldered to the cut off JST connector and this is then plugged into the single cell LiPo charging circuit to charge the battery. The finished weight of the data logging circuit and battery came to 12.03 grams.Now that the circuit is done it's time for programming...", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FR9/IE52/I80102G4/FR9IE52I80102G4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG4/073G/I84BHAQV/FG4073GI84BHAQV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOB/M26M/I800ZZTE/FOBM26MI800ZZTE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9I/2QC5/I800ZZU8/F9I2QC5I800ZZU8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIJ/GYFD/I800ZVLP/FIJGYFDI800ZVLP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAO/MH1N/I800ZZP3/FAOMH1NI800ZZP3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDC/WUKR/I800ZVMG/FDCWUKRI800ZVMG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEL/GVKE/I800ZVM3/FELGVKEI800ZVM3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYO/3BJC/I800ZVLK/FYO3BJCI800ZVLK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFW/LCZW/I80102MT/FFWLCZWI80102MT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5O/ACZM/I80102QV/F5OACZMI80102QV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2W/KWR2/I800ZVMI/F2WKWR2I800ZVMI.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Building the Data Logger "}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Let's load some code!Programming the Arduino is super easy. If you're not familiar with Arduino I wrote a basic guide to programming here.To program the Arduino you need to unplug the OpenLog board as it shares the same pins as the FTDI board needs during programming. The machine pin headers are a slightly different size than standard headers so I connect the FTDI board using jumper wires. Once the Arduino is programmed you can plug the OpenLog back into its header, connect the battery and check it out- there a couple of LEDs on the OpenLog that should light up. It should log data to the SD card just like what is shown in the photo- it will be labeled LOG#####.TXT on the SD card. The OpenLog is configured to communicate at 9600 baud rate so it's good to go out of the box. If you have trouble with it open up the SD card and look at the file labeled CONFIG.TXT and make sure the first line at the top says 9600- if the baud rate doesn't match the card won't record data properly.Every time you disconnect the battery and plug it back in the OpenLog will create a new log file on the SD card.I've included the data logging code here so you can download it.

The rocket hit the ground so hard the nose cone slammed back into the body like a cork and I had to pry it out.Epic fail!Upon turning the rocket over I saw there was a large hole torn in the side where the collapsed nose cone had pushed the data logger circuit back and out of the body. We also broke a fin. I was able to retrieve the circuit but the SD card had ejected and was nowhere to be seen- not only was our rocket damaged but we had no data to show for it. Bummer!I noticed the circuit was no longer functioning so I unplugged the battery and plugged it back in- still no power. We packed everything up, went home and started troubleshooting. The first thing we checked was the battery and it showed 4.17V on the multimeter but when it was plugged back in the circuit wouldn't power up. Next we checked the circuit by plugging it into my laptop and it was getting power. Very strange. Going back to the battery we discovered it was showing proper voltage but it couldn't provide any current- as soon as it was plugged into the circuit the voltage would immediately drop at the circuit input. Upon examining the battery's built in protection circuit we discovered one of the tiny circuit chips on the protection circuit had been torn off in the crash.

Luckily I had a 5V boost regulator board on hand that would bump our battery voltage to 5V to power it. Since the wonderful Adafruit accelerometer board and OpenLog can both handle both 3.3V and 5V input we were back in business. We took a bit of prototyping board and quickly assembled a new circuit. Since our OpenLog and accelerometer board survived the previous crash all we had to do was connect the power output from the 5V boost regulator to the VCC pin on the Pro Mini. All of our other connections remained the same but we had to construct it a bit different than our previous circuit due to the necessary boost regulator- all we did was run point to point wires for each of the connections for the accelerometer, power and ground. After uploading our code our circuit was ready to log some data. This circuit was slightly heavier than the first version at 15.28 grams.I knew that since we were now using a 5V board instead of a 3.3V board to read our accelerometer the numbers logged would be a bit different. Normally if you connect a 5V sensor to a 5V Arduino you would see values that range from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 1023. When you use a 3.3V sensor with a 5V Arduino the values will range from 0 to 675 because of the voltage/scaling difference. 3.3/5 * 1023 = 675.

Next we added our 5 gram weight and then closed the rocket back up and taped the nose cone shut before launching again.The weights were nothing more than a few BB's rolled up in duct tape pouch.On the second launch everything was kept the same except for the additional 5 grams added- air pressure was kept the same at 20 psi. Once the rocket came back we repeated the process with a 10 gram weight added. On the third launch with the 10 grams added the rocket came back noticeably faster and the nose cone was pushed into the rocket body a bit. We opened up the rocket and retrieved our data logger. The perfboard that we used to build the circuit had fractured during landing but everything was intact and more importantly we had our data this time! I would definitely recommend putting some crumpled paper or cotton balls between the nose cone and data logger to cushion the electronics in a hard landing.With our data safely tucked away we stayed at the site for a while launching over and over again (this time at 60 psi and higher.) We soon had a small group of kids around us wanting to check out our rocket launcher. It was pretty exciting and the kids had a ton of fun.

The first column is the elapsed time in milliseconds. The next column is the the accelerometer X axis reading, followed by the Y and Z axis. For the purpose of this experiment, what we really care about is the X axis data as that shows the vertical acceleration of the rocket.The accelerometer has a range of +/- 16g. At 0V we would get a reading of -16g and at 3.3V we would see +16g. The Arduino interprets this reading as a numerical value ranging from 0 to 1023 (this is called 10 bit resolution.) Now remember that I said the value would change when using a 3.3V sensor with a 5V Arduino? When using a 5V Arduino the maximum value interpreted will be 675 instead of 1023. Our logged accelerometer data reflects this. On our first launch the maximum accelerometer X axis value recorded is 664. With an additional 5 grams the max value is 398 and with 10 grams added the max value is 635. If we convert these numbers to g values (675 = +16g) we get +15.73g for the first launch, +9.43g for the second launch and +15.05g for the third launch.So why are the the recorded numbers lower for the second launch? In order to see what is going on let's make a line plot for each launch. First change the name of the .TXT file for each log to .CSV so it can be uploaded to a site like Plot.ly. This allows us to plot a line chart and zoom in and examine the acceleration data during the launch. On the second launch you can see the plot bounces up and down during the launch vs. it being near vertical for the other two launches. This could indicate the data logger possibly shifted around during the launch.  The first and last launch plots are more clear- there is a rapid acceleration recorded and clearly the heavier rocket had slower acceleration. We only recorded these three launches but ideally you would record as many launches as possible in as short a time as possible in order to gather the most accurate data.Why does the acceleration drop for a heavier rocket?Because physics! Newton's Second Law of Motion states that the net force on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by the acceleration of the object- or more simply put: force equals mass times acceleration.This Law is expressed in the formula F=ma.  F=force (in our case the 20psi air pressure of our launcher), m=mass (the mass of our rocket) and a=acceleration (the recorded acceleration of our rocket.) If we change this equation to solve for acceleration (what we measured) we get a=F/m. From looking at this equation and dividing the force by the mass we can see that since our launch force is constant, the higher the rocket mass the lower the acceleration number. This formula tells us that in the case of our second launch there must have been a problem with the launch or with our data logging and this is shown by the accelerometer graph plot.

The time difference between readings is on average 20 milliseconds -we're taking a reading every .02 seconds. This means we're logging data at a rate of 50Hz, or 50 samples per second since 1/.02 = 50.What if we want to log data at a faster rate?We can change the Arduino code to get more data points. If we change the baud rate we can speed up the data transmission and capture more samples. The default baud rate on the Arduino and OpenLog is 9600 but we can go all the way up to 115200.To change the baud rate we simply replace 9600 with 115200 in the Arduino code. You also have to change the baud rate for the OpenLog SD card to match, otherwise the card will just log gibberish. To change the OpenLog rate we change the first value in the CONFIG.TXT file on the SD card. Once this is done you'll see that we are now logging data every 4 milliseconds or .004 seconds. That's 250 Hz or 250 samples per second. In order to really take full advantage of this you need to change the accelerometer board as the Adafruit ADXL 326 board is set to 50Hz. By looking at the manufacturer's data sheet you can see it's possible to increase that bandwidth by swapping out some capacitors. For the purpose of our experiment this really wasn't necessary but it would be interesting to pursue this option later...Other possibilitiesNow that we're able to measure acceleration we could alter percentages of weight or launch force and run multiple back to back tests in order to see if our experimental data backs up our math. If it doesn't that means we have variables in our testing procedure that are affecting the outcome. Further testing could include three fins vs. four or various shapes of nose cones or fins and asking: How does aerodynamics affect the acceleration? We can also add an altitude sensor to the rocket can tell us how changes to our rocket affects the launch height. If you want to build a slimmer rocket use 1/2\" schedule 40 PVC pipe for the launch tube and rocket body tube mandrel. A slimmer rocket will have less drag and should be able to obtain higher launches but it will require modifying the data logger circuit in order to get it to fit inside the slimmer rocket body. The sky's the limit with what you can build and test!This was a great project for my son and I to do together and he had a blast doing it. He learned about the scientific process, how to solder, program an Arduino, overcome failure and build rockets!

Doing so gives you a neat and inexpensive method of capturing data in real-time and having the ability to analyse the data from almost anywhere, and export it with very little effort.Getting StartedIf you haven\u2019t already done so, ensure your Arduino Y\u00fan can connect to your network via WiFi or cable \u2013 and get a Temboo account (we run through this here). And you need (at the time of writing) IDE version 1.5.4 which can be downloaded from the Arduino website.

You can call them whatever you need. For new Google users, the URL shown in my example will be different to yours.

Look for the following line:const String SPREADSHEET_TITLE = \"your-spreadsheet-title\";and change your-spreadsheet-title to ArduinoData.Finally, create your header file by copying the the header file data from here (after logging to Temboo) into a text file and saving it with the name TembooAccount.h in the same folder as your sketch from above. You know this has been successful when opening the sketch, as you will see the header file in a second tab, for example in the second image above. Finally, save and upload your sketch to the Arduino Y\u00fan. After a moment or two it will send values to the spreadsheet, and repeat this every sixty seconds \u2013 for example in the third image above. If your Y\u00fan is connected via USB you can also watch the status via the serial monitor. One really super-cool and convenient feature of using Google Docs is that you can access it from almost anywhere. Desktop, tablet, mobile\u2026 and it updates in real-time.So with your Y\u00fan you can capture data and view it from anywhere you can access the Internet.

We use the RTC as the time and date from it will match when the data was captured, not when the data was written to the spreadsheet. If you don\u2019t have a DS3232 you can also use a DS1307.If you\u2019re not familiar with these parts and the required code please review this tutorial. When connecting your RTC \u2013 please note that SDA (data) is D2 and SCL (clock) is D3 on the Y\u00fan.The sketch for this example is a modified version of the previous sketch, except we have more data to send. The data is captured into variables from the line:// get the values from A0 to A3 and D7, D8You can send whatever data you like, as long as it is all appended to a String by the name of rowdata. When you want to use a new column in the spreadsheet, simply append a comma \u201c,\u201d between the data in the string. In other words, you\u2019re creating a string of CSV (comma-separated values) data. You can see this process happen from the line that has the comment:// CSV creation starts here!in the example sketch that follows shortly. Finally, you can alter the update rate of the sketch \u2013 it\u2019s set to every 60 seconds, however you can change this by altering the 60000 (milliseconds) in the following line:const unsigned long RUN_INTERVAL_MILLIS = 60000;Don\u2019t forget that each update costs you a call and some data from your Temboo account \u2013 you only get so many for free then you have to pay for more. Check your Temboo account for more details.So without further ado, the following sketch will write the values read from A0~A3, the status of D7 and D8 (1 for HIGH, 0 for LOW) along with the current date and time to the spreadsheet.

Sometimes it's nigh impossible. But the Digital Discovery makes it easier to monitor and troubleshoot complex digital circuits.In this Instructable, I will show how to monitor simple digital signals with a rather not-so-complex digital modulo 10k counter and 7-segment LED display.The code for the counter itself is written in Verilog and loaded onto a Digilent CMOD A7 bread-board compatible FPGA board. That being said, this is not a Verilog or FPGA tutorial. However the concepts behind the code will hopefully be explained enough so that you can use any other type of programmable chip and whatever language you are familiar with to follow along.The overall design and source code for this project is not my own but comes from the Verilog edition of Digital Design with some slight modifications to get it to work for this exact project. I will go over each individual logic block used in the design one at a time, and then tie them all together at the end.Once the code is defined and explained, I'll describe the external driver circuit for the LED display.Lastly, I'll go over how to use the Digital Discovery to monitor the signals.For this project you will need:- Digilent Digital Discovery.- Digilent Waveforms 2015 software.This is a free software download and is required to interface with the Digital Discovery.- Digilent CMOD A7.The A7 was chosen specifically because it has very few built-in peripheral devices on the board, i.e. no 7-segment LED display. As mentioned, any programmable chip and board will work for this.- Xilinx Vivado HLx tool suite. This is a free download that is compatible with Xilinx's family of FPGA chips. The A7 version I will be using uses the XC7A35T-1CPG236C chip.- 7-segment LED display. I used a common-cathode MSQ6941C, but a common-anode version will work with some design tweaks.- 4X NPN BJT transistors.I used 2N2222A, but this project won't be picky with a specific NPN version. These are used to control the cathode signals. The FPGA pins are not meant to drive high power loads, and while an LED might not seem like much, it's good practice to protect your chip FPGA by buffering the signal with a transistor. If you are using a common-anode display you will need to use PNP transistors on the anodes.- solderless bread-board and wires.Whatever works to make connections on the bread-board. Depending on your setup, you may need to use a couple of bread-boards.- 12X resistors.5X 1k\u03a9 resistors, one for each BJT base pin and one for the decimal point pin on the 7-segment display since it won't be used and can be driven low to keep it turned off.7X 150\u03a9 resistors, one for each segment anode pin on the display.", "title": "Monitoring Digital Circuits With the Digital Discovery", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Monitoring-Digital-Circuits-With-the-Digital-Disco/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The first block we will define is a clock divider, which is then used to drive the counter block and the 7-segment block. The A7 system clock is 12 MHz, so if we define a minimum 20-bit bus and toggle the LSB with the system clock, we can pick and choose any bit n (n starting at 0) and get a 2n+1 factor of 12 MHz. So if we use the first bit we would get 12 MHz / 20+1 = 6 MHz. The 2nd bit gives us 12 MHz / 21+1 = 3 MHz and so on.Based on this, we will define 2 additional clocks using this divider. One will be driven from bit 15 to give us a 183 Hz clock and will be used by the 7-segment driver block as the segment refresh rate. You want to have each segment refresh at about 50 Hz, and since we are using 4 segments, we need \u2248 200 Hz to drive the segment refresh rate.The second clock will be taken from bit 20 and will give us a 5.7 Hz clock which will be used by the counter block to increment the value shown on the display. Using a lower bit value will increase the count rate by some integer multiple of 2, i.e. bit 19 would increment the count at 11.4 Hz.Here's the code:module clkdiv(\n    input wire mclk,\n    input wire clr,\n    output wire clk183,\n    output wire clk6\n    );\n    \n    reg [23:0] q;\n    \n    always @(posedge mclk or posedge clr)\n    \tbegin\n    \t\tif(clr == 1)\n    \t\t\tq <= 0;\n    \t\telse\n    \t\t\tq <= q + 1;\n    \tend\n    \n    assign clk183 = q[15];  //183Hz\n    assign clk6 = q[20];   //6hz\nendmodule", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: The Clock Divider."}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Next we define the block that will count from 0-9999 and then reset back to 0.

As long as the \"clr\" button is not pressed or the count is not 9999, q will increment by 1 for each clock pulse.

With decimal, one digit can only accurately display up to \"9\", and then an additional digit is required to display the values 10-15. To do the conversion, we will use the double dabble, or shift-and-add-3, algorithm. I will leave it to you to verify that it works.The algorithm is as follows for an n-bit binary value:1) Shift the binary number left one bit.2) If n shifts have occurred, the BCD number is accurately represented in the Units, Tens, Hundreds, etc. columns.3) If the binary value in any of the BCD columns is greater than or equal to 5 after shifting, add 3 to that value in that BCD column.

The tutorial at electronics-tutorials.ws is another good option.The code contains a couple of case statements that determine which value to display and on which digit of the 7-segment display to put it.A 0-3 counter s takes the 5.7Hz clock as its trigger. The value of s is used to determine which anode is turned on as well as which 4 bits of the 16-bit binary input is used. The binary value of the digit is then converted to the 7-segment binary value that represents that digit.Normally you would drive the cathode value low and the anode value high in order to turn on the LED.

For LEDs to work the cathode must be more negative than the anode, so we should be sending a \"0\" signal to the cathode pins and a \"1\" signal to the anode pins. But the BJTs are in between what we have designated as the cathode pins in code on the A7 and the actual LED display cathode pins. NPN BJTs require a positive signal on the base pin in order to turn on, so the code requires a \"1\" to be output for both cathode and anode pins in order to turn on the LED. The BJT acts kind of like a... buffering inverter here I guess. When it receives a positive signal at the base, the connection across the collector and emitter pins is closed, connecting the LED cathode pin to \"0\" or GND.Anyway, here's the best schematic I could make.

(Go here for a more in depth look at the Logic Analyzer tool and here for a collection of tutorials for all of the Waveforms tool available.)Let's break up the 11 signals we want to observe into two distinct groups, \"digits\" and \"segments\", and then define each group as a bus in the tool window.Segment A on the 7-segment display maps to bit 0 of the \"segments\" bus, with segment G mapping to bit 6. Digit 1 (leftmost) on the display maps to bit 0 of the \"digits\" bus, with digit 4 mapping to bit 3.We can observe the data live simply by clicking on the run button at the top. You can adjust the time base of the window to view more or less data in the window. Below you see a full minute of captured date in one window. At about -21 s the count goes from 999 to 1000 so you see the signal for digit 1 turn on. At +6 s I reset the counter. You can see the digits begin to turn on as they are added to the display as the count increments the tens (\u2248+7.5 s) and then hundreds (\u2248+23 s) places.The problem is that if I want to zoom in on this data we start to lose data integrity and it becomes harder and harder to correctly interpret.Let's record the data instead. This way we can zoom in or out and not worry about losing data clarity. Click on the button that says \"Screen\" in the \"Mode:\" box and select \"Record\".The \"Single\" button will change to \"Config\". Click on it to configure the record options.\"Samples\" lets you determine how many samples will be taken. The rate at which those samples are taken is set in the \"Rate\" box. The \"Base\" box lets you determine how long you will be able to record information. You can only set two of the three options, while the software will do its best to auto-set the third value based on your other two choices. Since this project is running pretty slow, let's go with 6,000,000 samples at 10 kHz. The Base box should auto-fill with 1 min. Click \"Start\" once you have the configuration set. You should see something like this:At about +8 s I reset the counter, so you can see all of the digits reset, then digit 4 is on while the count is 0-9, then digit 3 turns at about +10 s and digit 2 turns on at about +26 s.Since I recorded the data, when I zoom in you can clearly see the rising/falling edges of the data.In this image we can see the time it took for the FPGA chip to reset, retrieve the saved program file from flash memory, load it, and start counting again. The digit signal starts again and then very soon after the data for the segments starts up. If we zoom in even more we can start to pick out the actual data. Let's look at the data at +8.17 s, right before I reset the counter.You can see that in the \"digits\" bus, bit 3 is high, so digit 4 (the rightmost digit) is high, and therefore that digit is turned on. Moving up into the \"segments\" bus and starting with bit 0 (segment A) we can see that bits 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 are all high while bit 4 is low. So segments A, B, C, D, F, and G are all on while segment E is off. This pattern corresponds to the pattern for the decimal digit \"9\" and is displayed in the Ones place.Moving right to about +6 ms, we see that digits[2] is on, and segments[0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6] are all high. This matches the previous pattern so we should also see a decimal \"9\" on the display in the Tens place.Moving right again to about +11 ms, digits[1] is on and segments[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] are all high. This pattern is for the decimal digit \"0\", so we should see \"0\" in the Hundreds place.Lastly, at about +18 ms digits[0] is high and segments[0, 1, 2, 3, 6] are all high. This pattern corresponds to the decimal digit \"3\" and is displayed in the Thousands place.We can therefore conclude that the value of the counter when I reset it was 3099.At this point we're done with this project. By default the Digital Discovery can sample up to 200 million samples per second. The next step goes over how to use the High-Speed Adapter for the Digital Discovery to monitor signals at up to 800 million samples per second.", "step_imgs": ["/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png"], "step_title": "Step 8: Monitoring the Signals. Finally"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "The Logic Analyzer tool for the Digital Discovery has a sample rate of 200 MS/s. By adding the High Speed Adapter and using the included high-speed logic probes, we can increase the sample rate up to 800 MS/s. To do this, select the \"800MHz DIN 0..7\" option in the \"Inputs\" box above the acquisition window. The Digital Discovery will re-allocate the resources used to sample channels 8-23, limiting us to using channels 0-7.Since the speed of the CMOD A7 clock is only 12 MHz, I'm going to substitute in the Nexys 4 for this step, which has a core clock of 100 MHz. I really want to try and push the capabilities of the Digital Discovery. The program blocks are all the same but the code is adapted to be used on the Nexys 4. The Vivado project file is included as a zipped file.Using the 100 MHz clock to drive the 10k counter means that the 7-segment will be counting so fast that you'll never see the digits change. But if, in the program code, we tie the segment signals and one of the anode signals to several of the pins tied to the PMOD connectors JA and JB, we can use the HSA to observe these signals.Each high-speed probe comes as a twisted pair, one red and one black wire.When looking at the HSA, the topmost and bottommost rows of pins are all tied to GND (blue boxes) while the two innermost rows of pins correspond to pins 0-23 (red boxes).Simply connect the high-speed probes so that the black wire connects to GND and the red wire connects to the associated input port.Now here's the tricky part. All of the black GND wires are tied to the Nexys PMOD GND pins through a couple of jumper wires using a small bread-board power strip. The red wires are tied to the several pins on the PMOD connectors JA and JB. The heat shrink tubing on the probes won't allow for more than three probe wires to be placed next to each other on the PMOD header, so you have to get a little creative. Luckily there are a lot of pins to work with on the Nexys.Once we have all of the connections made we can get to collecting the data. We will need to use the record option again, so configure the settings as follows:Click on \"Start\" and you should get something like the following. Click here for a much clearer, higher resolution version.I added some cursors to highlight some timing blocks. You can see clear differences between the blocks when you look at the \"segments\" bus. If you look close at the \"digit\" signal at the top, you'll see that in the first block I have highlitghted it goes low. I have the anode signal to digit 4 (rightmost) connected here, and during this block we see that digit 4 is turned on. There are three more blocks where the other three digits have their chance to shine, but since I'm limited to only 8 signals if I want to utilize the full 800 MS/s rate, I could only pick one digit.By zooming in on the data right near the first cursor, we can really start to see what's going on. (high res)Looking at the \"segments\" line in the table you'll see a decimal value displayed which corresponds to the binary data shown below in the individual \"segments\" channels. Taking a look at the decimal value \"2\" we see that with 7 bits the binary value is \"0000010\". Remembering that for the Nexys-based code a \"0\" means that the segment is on, and then mapping the segments as \"GFEDCBA\", we see that only segment \"B\" is off. This is a decimal-valued \"6\".Looking at the next few decimal values we find that \"120\" displays a \"7\", \"0\" displays an \"8\", \"16\" displays a \"9\", \"64\" displays a \"0\", etc. We are cycling through all of the decimal values 0-9 in order and then starting over. Sounds like a clock. It's hard to tell in this view, but by adding a couple more cursors we can measure the distance between two instances of the same value and find that the time is 100 \u03bcs. This equates to 10 kHz, which is what we should be expecting for the Thousands place digit using a 100 MHz clock to drive the Ones place digit. When we consider that the Ones place digit is ticking at 100 MHz, then divide that value down by 10 kHz for the Thousands place digit to cycle 0-9, we see that the Thousands place digit is cycling 0-9 at 10 kHz.Now let's look at the data in the One's place. (high res)Take a second to look at the high resolution version. I added the cursors to make the data easier to read. From cursor 1 on the left to cursor 11 on the right is a spread of only 100 ns. At 800 MS/s, that comes out to only 800 samples in that time frame. So it looks like we succeeded in pushing the Digital Discovery's capabilities. But let's analyze what we see.The cursors I added are each separated by 10 ns. If we look at the decimal value displayed in the \"segments\" line where each cursor is placed, we see that the same pattern of 10 decimal values that we saw when we looked at the Thousands place is displayed, albeit with some added \"bonus data\". We get some noise in the signal when we have several channels change state all at once. Look between cursors 8 and 9. To change from \"121\" (binary \"1111001\") to \"36\" (binary \"0100100\") we need 5 values to change state. Each channel changes, but not all at the exact same time. If we look at all of the data, we'll see that the only \"bonus data\" we get is when the channels are changing states. But note that the correct data is present at the correct time and that there is no errant data on the channels, they just don't all change state at the exact same moment. This is due to propagation delays inherent to the trace routing on the Nexys 4 PCB itself. Some traces are slightly longer than others so the signal takes just a bit longer to get to the end. We don't often think about this because the projects we work on don't often deal with this time scale.", "step_imgs": ["/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png", "/assets/img/pixel.png"], "step_title": "Step 9: Using the High Speed Adapter"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "The Digital Discovery is a superb tool that allows you to observe and record high-speed data.

The first implementation of a pfodParser was in ASM on an Atmel Atiny84 8bit microprocessor. As the conclusion saysUnder the pfod protocol, the pfodDevice\u2122 advertises its capabilities to the pfodApp\u2122 so the same pfodApp can be used to control any pfodDevice. The pfod protocol is very simple with minimal message structures and is readily implemented by small micro-processors ...While pfodApp has moved on to Android and the pfod protocol has expanded to include addition features like menu caching and sliders and charts and additional formatting of fonts sizes and colours, the parser needed on the microprocessor is still very simple.pfodDesignerV2 WYSIWYG menu design and Unicode supportThe latest version of pfodDesignerV2 (V2.0.2181+), which lets you design menus and charts on your Android mobile in a WYSIWYG fashion, now generates C code (C++ compatible) that can be readily used in any small microprocessor to render that menu on pfodApp and handle the user's inputs to control your micro. Check out the detailed pfodDesignerV2 tutorials on this page for how to design pfodApp menus and generate the code. Select the C Code target from the Generate Code screen.pfodDesignerV2 also supports Unicode characters so you can design non-english menus and include special symbols such as \u2103 To enter Unicode into pfodDesignerV2, type in \\uxxxx, e.g. \\u2103 which will be immediately replaced with the actual symbol i.e. \u2103 , provided your Android mobile has the appropriate font installed. When pfodDesignerV2 generates the C code it outputs the Octal representation for the bytes that make up this Unicode character. e.g. \\342\\204\\203. This page, Using Non-ASCII chars in Arduino and other micro-processors, has a Java program that also does this conversion.The pfodDesignerV2 does not cover all the pfod messages or all the options. For the complete pfod message specification see the pfodSpecification.pdf.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: Background"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The pfodParserC Library consists of three (3) C code files and their associated header files, pfodParser.c, pfodParserStream.c and pfodMenu.c. pfodParser.c parses the incoming messages from pfodApp and does not change. The pfodParserStream.c files needs to be customized for your microprocessors UART implementation. The third file, pfodMenu.c is generated for you by pfodDesignerV2 and contains the menus and sub-menus definitions and the main command switch statement to handle the parsed messages from pfodApp.The pfodParserC Library page contains a zip file and installation instructions for these files. Those files are based on a PIC18F14K22 using the MPLAB IDE. The necessary customization of the library for your particular microprocessor is covered next. If your microprocessor is programmed by the Arduino IDE then an Arduino version of the library is also available. The pfodParseC Library uses about 84 bytes of RAM and a few kilo-bytes of Program. As you can see the RAM usage is very modest. The program space depends on your compiler and its optimization settings.Overall approach to using pfodParserC on your microprocessorModify the pfodParserStream.c file to work with our micro's I/O so you can send and receive bytes.  Don't touch pfodParser.c at all. It does not change   Use the free pfodDesignerV2 to design the menu you want and then generate the pfodMenu.h and pfodMenu.c files. Replace any existing files with these new ones   Only use the variables and methods exposed in pfodMenu.h in your code (main.c)   Connect a communication module, Bluetooth, Bluetooth LE or WiFi, and use the pfodApp to control your board and log and plot data from it.Once you are familiar with pfodSpecification.pdf you can make manual changes to the pfodMenu files outside the pfodDesignerV2Customization the pfodParserC Library(Also see the pfodParserC Library installation and configuration)As mentioned above the pfodMenu.c and its header are generated for you by the pfodDesignerV2 by using the C Code target when generating the code for the menu you have designed. The pfodParser.c and its header are constant across the microprocessors. It is only the pfodParserStream.c file that you need to customize to your particular microprocessor and compiler.The pfodParserStream file handles the I/O for the parser and menu. It only has four (4) methods:-size_t pfodParser_TXfree(void);\nint pfodParser_write(uint8_t c);\nsize_t pfodParser_RXavailable(void);\nint pfodParser_read(void);The pfodParser uses the pfodParser_read() and pfodParser_RXavailable() to get the bytes to parse from the communication channel module (Bluetooth, BLE, WiFi), usually via the microprocessor's UART. The pfodParser_printXX() methods use the pfodParser_write(uint8_t) and pfodParser_TXfree() methods to write data back to pfodApp.Because each microprocessor and each circuit has different ports/UARTs/ISP connections to the communication module, you need to first customization the implementation of these four methods to suit your particular set-up.Here is a typical implementation. (MPLAB / PIC18F14K22 / UART with STDIO redirect)  It will be covered in detail in the examples below./**\n * This is the interface to the i/o\n * Modify this file to suit your serial/uart connection code\n * \n */\n#include \"pfodParserStream.h\"\n#include \"mcc_generated_files/mcc.h\"\nextern uint8_t pfodParser_connected; // set true (1) when {.} parsed, set false (0) when {!} parsed./**\n * return space available for write();\n * @return bytes free, if space is available any non-zero return will do\n */\nsize_t pfodParser_TXfree(void) {\n    return eusartTxBufferRemaining;\n} int pfodParser_write(uint8_t c) {\n    if (!pfodParser_connected) {\n        return 1;\n    }\n    while (pfodParser_TXfree() == 0) {\n        // spin\n    }\n    putch((char)c); // spins if no space available\n    return 1;\n}/**\n * return bytes available to read(void)\n * @return bytes available, if bytes are available any non-zero return will do\n */\nsize_t pfodParser_RXavailable() {\n    return eusartRxCount;\n}int pfodParser_read(void) {\n    while (pfodParser_RXavailable() == 0) {\n        // spin\n    }\n    return (int)getch(); // spins if not data available\n}\nIn the above example code, MPLAB IDE provides two variables to use for pfodParser_TXfree() and pfodParser_RXavailable() and setting STDIO redirect in the UART configuration, links putch(uint8_t) and getch() to send and receive bytes to the UART.You need to provide similar support in your microprocessor. You don't need to have a hardware UART, although that is desirable. You can use a half-duplex software UART implementation or an ISP interface. (See below on how to reliably use a half-duplex software UART)In general, the code avoids the newer C99 features. The exception is uint8_t. If your compiler does not recognize this type add the following typedef to the top of each filetypedef unsigned char uint8_t;That's all the customization necessary to use pfodParser in your code. See below for how to debug your customization.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 2: Modifying the PfodParserC Library for Your Microprocessor"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Once you have customized the pfodParserStream.c file for your set-up, you will want to action the user's commands in your program and perhaps send back some data for logging or plotting. Your main.c file will typically look something like this..// other header includes\n#include \u201cpfodMenu.h\u201d\nvoid main() {\n  // initialize your microprocessor, clock settings, interrupts, I/O\n   . . .\n  pfodParser_setup();  initialize pfodParser\n  while (1) {  // loop here doing your stuff\n    pfodParser_parse();   // call this each loop the parse incoming messages \n    // and set the pfodParser global vars with user data and send back menus and data (if any)\n   //  you other loop code here which uses the variables set by pfodParser to control your hardware.\n   . . .\n  }\n}Looking at a simple menu design that just turns a led on and off. (The full MPLAB example to turn a Led on and off is given below)pfodDesignerV2 generates the following pfodMenu.h file (as well as the pfodMenu.c file). As you can see this file is C++ compatible in case your micro development system is C++ based.The first comment shows the menu message that will be returned to the pfodApp when pfodApp connects and asks for the main menu by sending the command {.} /* ===== pfod Command for PIC ====\npfodApp msg {.} --> {,<bg n><b><+3>~PIC Led Control`0~V29|A`0~Led is ~~Off\\On~}\n */\nThe pfodDesignerV2 generates this response for you to match the menu, colours, font size and text you have designed. See the pfodSpecification.pdf for the details. All pfod messages are enclosed by { }The cmd_A_var holds the user's requested led state, 0 for Off, 1 for On.extern int cmd_A_var; // name the variable for 'Led is'  0=Off 1=OnSo in the while (1) loop of your main code you use this variable to control the led. The LED_RC0.. methods set the micro's output RC0 high or low.         if (cmd_A_var) {\n            LED_RC0_SetHigh(); //sets RC0 output pin high\n        } else {\n            LED_RC0_SetLow();  //set pin low\n        }The complete code for this MPLAB example is included in a later step.No plots have been defined in pfodDesignerV2, so just the default pfodParser_sendDataFlag and plot_X_var are defined. These will be discussed in the next section and in second example.The pfodParser_connected variable can be used to control parts of the code that should only run while there is a connection. This is the variable the is used to ignore pfodParser_printXX() calls when there is no connection to pfodApp.Finally the PFOD_PARSER_BUFFER_SIZE define sets the size of the pfodParser storage buffer. The pfodSpecification.pdf limits the maximum command from the pfodApp to 255 bytes, but the pfod messages your micro sends to the pfodApp are designed so that you always know exactly the maximum size the pfodApp commands can be. Using this information the pfodDesignerV2 can calculate the maximum length of an incoming message for your designed menu and reduce the allocated RAM accordingly. If you manually add other pfod screens, for example a text input screen, you may need to increase this buffer size.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5A/05XD/IRT0SSMT/F5A05XDIRT0SSMT.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: \u200bHandling User Commands"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "As mentioned above, all pfod messages are enclosed in { }. Any byte sent by your micro (the pfodDevice) outside of { } is raw data and is automatically logged to a file on your mobile. The pfodApp displays the name of this file when you exit. While you can send any raw data you want, including debugging output, if you want to plot your data you need to send it as CSV (comma separated values).In the pfodMenu.c file there is the pfodParser_sendData() method. If you did not add a chart to your pfodDesignerV2 design then a minimal method is generated for you to fill in manually.This method is called at the end of the pfodParser_parse() method. If pfodParser_sendDataFlag is false (0) then it just return. Also if the pfodParser_connected is false (0) the pfodParser_printXX() methods just return without sending any data. To send data you need to be connected and you need to set pfodParser_sendDataFlag to true (non-0). When you are connected, each time you set pfodParser_sendDataFlag to true, the next call to pfodParser_parse() will send the data and clear the pfodParser_sendDataFlag to false. Typically you would use a timer in your microprocessor to set pfodParser_sendDataFlag to true at regular intervals.This will be covered in detail in the second example. See the pfodSpecification.pdf for more details on sending data for plotting.If you add a Chart to your menu in pfodDesignerV2, you automatically get upto 3 plots. You can add more manually if you need. pfodDesignerV2 lets you set labels and hide unused plots and preview the chart. For example if you define a chart with two plots showing, as shown in the picture above, pfodDesignerV2 generates the following pfodParser_sendData() method, as well as a button to show the chart.void pfodParser_sendData() {<br>  // assigned values to the global plot variables are sent here\n  if (!pfodParser_sendDataFlag) {\n      return;\n  }\n  pfodParser_sendDataFlag = 0;\n  // send plot data in CSV format\n  pfodParser_printLong(plot_X_var);\n  pfodParser_printCh(','); pfodParser_printLong(plot_1_var);\n  pfodParser_printCh(','); pfodParser_printLong(plot_2_var);\n  pfodParser_printCh(','); // Plot 3 is hidden in pfodDesignerV2. No data sent.\n  pfodParser_println(); // end of CSV data record\n  plot_X_var++; \n}The pfodMenu.h file is also updated to include the global plot variables plot_1_var and plot_2_var. These variable are defined as volatile so they can be updated from a timer interrupt routine.To actually send the data, in your main.c you need to assign some values to plot_1_var and plot_2_var and set pfodParser_sendDataFlag to true (non-0). In this example, timer TMR0 is set up to call the TMR0_CallBack() method once a second. (See the second MPLAB PIC plotting example below for details on configuring a PIC timer.) In that interrupt call back values are assigned to the plot vars and the pfodParser_sendDataFlag to true so then next call to pfodParser_parse() will send this data as a CSV record.Since TMR0_CallBack() is called from an interrupt, it should be keep as short as possible. Just assign the plot values here, collect and calculate them somewhere else.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FG7/0WKT/IRT0SWZ9/FG70WKTIRT0SWZ9.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Sending Data to PfodApp for Logging and Plotting"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Your pfodDevice (your micro) cannot force a menu update in pfodApp on your Android mobile. In order to get the menu updated you need to set a menu re-request interval for that menu in pfodDesignerV2. pfodApp will then re-request the menu regularly and display the latest values. For example if some other part of your code turned the Led off, then update cmd_A_var to reflect this and when pfodApp re-requests the menu it will display the updated Led state on your mobile.pfodApp caches each menu with a revision string. Then when it re-requests that menu, either at the next connection or re-request interval, pfodApp sends its current menu version as part of the request. pfodParser parses this menu version and compares it to its current version and if they match, pfodParser_parse() only send back a short menu update message instead of the full menu.For example the full menu may be {,<+3>~PIC Led Control`0~V26|A`0~Led is ~~Off\\On~|B~Plot of Random Data}but the refresh message is only{;|A`1}V26 is the menu version and the refresh message only sends the current value of the Led, its Off/On setting. This means that while the initial menu may be very long, up to 1024 bytes of text and menu items, it is only sent once and thereafter the much shorter update messages are sent. Because pfodApp saves the cached menu across connection attempts, the full menu is only sent on the very first connection.The pfodDesignerV2 automatically updates the menu version each time you generate a new set of code. However if you manually update the pfodParser_sendMainMenu() method in the generated pfodMenu.c, you should also change the pfodParser_pfodParser(ver) in the pfodParser_setup() method.The pfodParser_printXX() are blocking.  If there is no space available in the TX buffer, they block until there is.  The method pfodParser_TXfree() is used to check if there is any free space.  This ensures that no response bytes are lost.  Since almost all menu updates are short messages, you only need a small TX buffer to hold the response.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 5: Sending Updates, Menu Caching, Short Refresh Msgs and Blocking Prints"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Ignoring sending raw data, i.e. pfodParser_sendData(), the pfodParserC library is Half-Duplex safe. The pfodDevice, your micro, waits for pfodApp to send a command and then sends just one response. pfodApp does not send any other commands while waiting for the response to the pending one.If your micro has a half-duplex UART, the simplest approach is to not send any raw data or plot data. If you need to send some raw data or plot data then the only safe time to send it on a half-duplex connection is after the pfodParser has finished parsing a command and before it send the response. For example, in pfodMenu.c, the beginning of pfodParser_parse() isvoid pfodParser_parse() {<br>  uint8_t cmd = pfodParser_parse_RX(); // parse incoming data from connection\n  // parser returns non-zero when a pfod command is fully parsed\n  if (cmd != 0) { // have parsed a complete msg { to }Once cmd != 0, the parser has finished parsing the pfodApp's command and the UART can start sending without missing any incoming data.  Once the response has been sent the UART must stop sending data and listen for a new command from pfodApp.  So if your hardware only has a Half-Duplex UART, you can safely send raw data or CSV records immediately after the statement cmd != 0 statement. i.e. insert a call to pfodParser_sendData() there and remove it from the bottom of the pfodParser_parse() method.if (cmd != 0) { // have parsed a complete msg { to }<br>    pfodParser_sendData(); // safe to send data here if half-duplex UARTOf course this means that you can only send raw data when the pfodApp sends a command, so set a re-request interval for this menu so that pfodApp regularly re-requests the menu and allows you to send raw data.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 6: Half-Duplex Operation"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "Here are two examples using MPLAB to program a PIC18F14K22 via PICkit3.

A is the command associated with the On/Off button and the arguments 0,1 represent Off and On. The cmd_A_var is set with this argument value, when the command arrives. Finally pfodMenu.c sends back a menu update is sent back to the pfodApp to display.In your main.c file you can use the current value of cmd_A_var to control the Led.

In this example you will use the C code target to generate the pfodMenu.h and pfodMenu.c files needed for non-Arduino based processors.Start with your previous \u201cPIC Led Control\u201d menu design in pfodDesignerV2. Following the example of How to Display/Plot Arduino Data on Android, add a chart button called \u201cPlot of Random Data\u201d containing a chart labelled \u201cPIC Data\u201d with two plots (i.e. hide Plot 3). Plot 1 labelled \u201cRandom Data\u201d and Plot 2 labelled \u201cLed setting\u201d with Y axis \u201cLED (On=1)\u201d, Fixed Scale and a Plot Data Variable Range of (-1 to 2) Generate the C code and replace the existing pfodMenu.h and pfodMenu.c files with the new generated code. Here are the generated pfodMenu.h and pfodMenu.c files. Do a clean rebuild and re-program your PIC. (Note: disconnect the Adafruit's TX/RX lines when reprogramming so it does not get confused.) Then when you connect with pfodApp you will see your new menu.Clicking on the \u201cPlot of Random Data\u201d button open the chart with two empty plot.

If you don't assign a value to plot_X_var then pfodParser_sendData() will just send an incrementing counter for the X axis.Setting up a 1sec TimerOpen the Code Configurator again (Tools \u2192 Embedded \u2192 Code Configurator Open/Close) and from Device Resources (left hand side) open the Timer section and double click on TMR0. Configure it as shown above. This set the time to call the interrupt method once a second.Click the Generate tab to re-generate the MPLAB config files. There are now two new files tmr0.h and tmr0.cunder mcc_generated_files. The SYSTEM_Initialize() method now automatically initializes and starts timer TMR0.Open the tmr0.c file and cut the void TMR0_CallBack(void) method and paste at the bottom on your main.c file.Setting and Sending the Plot DataEdit the TMR0_CallBack method to assign values to the plot variables and to set pfodParser_sendDataFlag to non-zero. This example overrides plot_X_var with a sec. counter and just assigns a random value for plot_1_var and assigns the current value of cmd_A_var to plot_2_var.unsigned long timeSec = 0;void TMR0_CallBack(void)\n{\n    timeSec++;\n    plot_X_var = timeSec;\n    plot_1_var = 450+600+(rand()%100);\n    plot_2_var = cmd_A_var;\n    pfodParser_sendDataFlag = 1; // send data once per sec\n}The complete edited main.c is here. You need to add stdlib.h to the includes for rand().Since the TMRO_CallBack() is an interrupt callback method, it should be kept short with little or no calculation in it. Just assign the variables and return.Now when you connect with pfodApp and turn the led on and off a few times the plot looks like the chart above.The CSV plot data is also logged to a file on your Android for later downloading and further analysis. The raw data filename is displayed as you exit pfodApp. See pfodAppForAndroidGettingStarted.pdf for more details.The complete MPLAB project for a PIC18F14K22 is in DataLogging.X.zipConclusionThis second MPLAB PIC18F14K22 example builds on the first one to add data logging and plotting. pfodDesignerV2 does most of the coding for you and generates the pfodMenu.h and pfodMenu.c files. You only need to assign values to the plot variables and set the pfodParser_sendDataFlag. pfodApp automatically saves the data to a file on your mobile for later use.

This builds off of a previous Instructable which shows you how to build a basic weather station which logs to an SD card with a few Adafruit sensors and an Arduino. It's a good starting place and we recommend building it here. Once you've done that you can make a few changes and you'll be ready to gather data as your balloon disappears into the sky!Our mobile station is equipped with the original contents of our station (minus the anemometer): an Arduino wired to a protoboard with a data logging shield, a DHT22 Temperature and Humidity sensor, and a BMP280 barometric pressure and altitude sensor. In addition to this, we added 2 cameras, different housing, and a few other extras which allow us to protect all of our sensors and cameras.

Our other camera only got about thirty minutes of footage, and we think that the changing temperature on the ascent sapped the battery.

A link to the Instructable that we used as our template can be found here. We used a 600g balloon from High Altitude Science and a 5 foot Rocketman parachute, which was perfect for our payload size.You'll also need to run simulations of your balloon flight to see where it's likely to land and how much helium to use. To calculate our helium needs, we used this site. For our balloon, we needed about 80 cubic feet of helium. This also allows you to determine lift, ascent rate, burst altitude, and flight duration. Once you've done that, use one of thesesites to determine the trajectory of your flight. These simulations are remarkably accurate, and they will let you decide when to launch so that you can retrieve your balloon with minimal fuss. However, note that if you don't have a good way of measuring the lift of the balloon during launch, you'll only be able to make vague estimates of when it will burst and how far it will go. Our balloon ended up going considerably farther than expected, which landed us in a spot of trouble when it landed in a military base.

Cut off the excess parts of the Kate\u2019s Paperie bag that you will not need. You want to have a flat blank sheet of paper without any creases. You will be using this sheet to create a variety of individual strips.\n2. With your measuring tape, measure the circumference of the large tube. This measurement will be the length of your strip. This strip will be used for decorating the end of your telescope. (See 1st photo for reference).\n3. Using your ruler, mark off the dimensions of your strip on to your paper. Use the measurement above for the length of your strip. And make your strip 1.5\u201d wide.\n4. Now, you are going to cover the smaller tube. With your measuring tape, measure the circumference of the small tube. This measurement will be the length of your strip.\n5. Using your measuring tape again, measure the length of the tube from the exposed edge to the edge of the black cap. Do not include the cap size in your measurement. This measurement will be the width of your strip.\n6. Using your ruler, mark off the length and width of your strip onto your card stock.\n7. Cut out your strips.\n8. Glue strips onto your tubes with a glue gun or another heavy duty glue.\n9. Now, you will create a strip to hide the raw edges of your slit. Create a narrow strip that is .5\u201d longer than the slit on your large tube.\n10. Make another strip from card stock with the same dimensions for the opposite side of the telescope. Place this piece on the opposite side of the slit to make your design look symmetrical.\n11. Glue these two strips to your telescope.Adding rivets:\n1. Heat up your glue gun.\n2. Around the edges, add beads of glue. Space the beads of glue evenly to create the illusion of rivets. As you drop a bead of glue into place, keep still for a few seconds for the glue to dry. It's easy for the glue to drip or loose it's shape if you move too quickly. You want the drops to look circular.\nAdd as much detail and texture to your toy as you like. I encourage you to also look around your house for more discarded materials that you can recycle for this project. Create different textures by attaching gears from an old watches and wires from old cell phone chargers.Piecing your telescope together:\n1. Slide the smaller tube into the larger tube. Slide this tube in as far as it can go.\n2. Once your telescope is in its collapsed state, positioned the way you want it.\n3.

The period is the amount of time between the sensor sending out and receiving a pulse.To view the period of each pulse, open the Serial Monitor (Ctrl+Shift+M). We will use these values to find a correlation between the period (in microseconds) and the distance to the object the ultrasonic sensor is facing (in any unit of distance you choose).Create a new Google Sheets document. Microsoft Excel works too, but for this tutorial we will be using the former. Create two columns: the first will be for pulse duration, and the second will be for distance. Place a ruler on top of a horizontal flat surface with the end that reads zero perpendicular to a vertical flat surface. Consider, for example, a tabletop and a hardcover book. Choose intervals along the ruler at which you will be placing your ultrasonic sensor such that it is facing and parallel to the vertical flat surface.Tip: Choose a small interval that spans the entirety of your ruler. The more data points you have, the more calibrated your ultrasonic sensor will be.Start your ultrasonic sensor closest to the vertical surface and turn it on. Record the period of the pulse in the first column of your Google Sheet, then record the ultrasonic sensor's distance along the ruler for that pulse.

I will now show you how the wind direction is working. It is also reading and uploading UV \u00edndex.There are a few projects around that use a setup of reed swicthes to get the wind heading. I always thought that it does a pretty simple solution, but nowadays with digital compasses it seems more appropriate to use one of these small devices. Also, since my objective was to run all sensors on I2C bus, i was sure that i could find one that would fit in this type of bus. So i did.I am using a HMC5883L, which is a 3 axis digital compass, using I2C bus. You can find ready soldered modules on ebay as cheap as 1 euro. Just search and you'll find them for sure.One piece of advice with this sensor. I believe that this kind of sensors are quite sensitive, since i managed to kill one. After a few days of getting wrong indications from it, i got a new one and all sorted out. Just be careful , don't drop it too many often.The other importante part that i used is called a slip ring. What is a slip ring? It's a small device that allows you to have a rotating axis and connections at the same time. There are several parameters that define such device. One is the number of ways(or wires) and other is the rated current accepted through the wires. Since we are only Reading sensor, and in this case I2c, we will need 4 wires and the current is as low as you can get.I got a 6 wire , low current which happened to have the axis diameter the same as the inner measure of some plastic tubing that i used to build the vane.The various pictures show how i managed to build the thing. It's not pretty but it dows the job. SOFTWAREIt's a pretty simple thing to read from the HCM. I took a few looks on the datasheet, made some research in the web, and i got to these code lines to put it working :def write_byte(address,adr, value):    bus.write_byte_data(address, adr, value)- Procedure to write data in a specific address of the I2C bus.def median(lst):    lst = sorted(lst)    if len(lst) < 1:            return None    if len(lst) %2 == 1:            return lst[((len(lst)+1)/2)-1]    else:            return float(sum(lst[(len(lst)/2)-1:(len(lst)/2)+1]))/2.0- This is a procedure for getting the average number of a list of readings. It will be neededwrite_byte(0x1E,0, 0b01110000) # Set to 8 samples @ 15Hzwrite_byte(0x1E,1, 0b00100000) # 1.3 gain LSb / Gauss 1090 (default)write_byte(0x1E,2, 0b00000000) # Continuous samplingscale = 0.92x_offset = 45y_offset = -82- Needed declarations for the sensor. The first 3 lines set up sample readings and gain. The fouth sets the scaling. The 2 last ones are values to tune up the sensor Reading. They may vary from sensor to sensor, but most of the times they do not affect much the Reading.def get_heading(): x_out = (read_word_2c(0x1E,3) - x_offset) * scale y_out = (read_word_2c(0x1E,7) - y_offset) * scale z_out = (read_word_2c(0x1E,5)) * scale bearing  = math.atan2(y_out, x_out)  if (bearing < 0):  bearing += 2 * math.pi if ((math.degrees(bearing) + 90) < 360 and (math.degrees(bearing)+90) > 90):  heading = math.degrees(bearing)+90#  print round(heading,0) elif math.degrees(bearing)+90 == 360:  heading = 0#  print round(heading,0) else:  heading = math.degrees(bearing)-270#  print round(heading,0) return heading- This is the main reading procedure. It gives you the heading of the vane in degrees from 0 to 359So now that we have all declarations and procedures, the only missing past is insert the next code into the main program :dir = 0 lista = range(500) print('Reading 500 times wind direction separated by 10mS each for smoothing final reading ...') for dd in range (0, 500):  lista[dd] = get_heading()  time.sleep(0.01) direction = median(lista) print('Done !') print('Wind dir is ',direction)I found that doing just one reading would result in huge variations in the direction, so what we are donig here is taking 500 measurements separated by 10mS each, and outputting the average of all values. All print lines can be deleted since they only serve for debugging purposes.Do not forget to update the upload line to wunderground, now we have more data, so you have to put in windir=direction, in my case.Cheers, folks!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FLL/TIGV/I7KB2454/FLLTIGVI7KB2454.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAI/4QBE/IATH6ZH2/FAI4QBEIATH6ZH2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJB/4OM8/IATH6ZIW/FJB4OM8IATH6ZIW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFK/GCXC/IATH6ZKC/FFKGCXCIATH6ZKC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXJ/GL2A/IATH6ZLS/FXJGL2AIATH6ZLS.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 10: Project Update 1 - Wind Direction"}, {"step": 11, "steps_text": "Hi folksStill waiting for the new slip rings from China, hope i'll get them in a couple of weeks, and then as promissed i will update with the howto of wind direction and wind speed.I've made some changes on the main program which you can download.

This can be changed at your will.I'm using a cron job to run the program each 5 minutes instead of being running all the time.

Mass never change and if your mass is 71 kilograms then the weight is basically your mass multiplied by the gravity (10) which gives you the actual weight on earth.

This will simplify things on the Python side.

To do this, you must import the serial library.ou then create a serial object which will be used to read the data. In the sample below, we call the object \u2018arduinoSerialData\u2019. We then create a While loop that loops continuously. Inside that loop we check to see if there is any data available on the serial port, and if there is, we read it into the variable myData, and print it.import serial #Import Serial Library\narduinoSerialData = serial.Serial('com11',9600) \n while (1==1):\n    if (arduinoSerialData.inWaiting()>0):\n        myData = arduinoSerialData.readline()\n        print myDataRemember than in the line that creates the adruinoSerialData object, you need to change the com port to whatever com port your arduino is sending on. You can see this by looking under tools- port in your arduino IDE window. Also, this format is for windows machines. You would have to adjust for apple computers.It is important to remember that the command .readline() in Python will read a string, so we need to remember that myData is a string, and if we want to use it as a number we will need to convert it to a float, with something like distance = float (myData). Then distance will be a normal number, not a string. As a first demonstration lets create an object using the vPython library that is a cylinder. We will need to import the vPython library, and we will create the object before the while loop, and then inside the while loop, we will adjust the length parameter of the cylinder. We will make the cylinder with a length of six inches, we will make it yellow in color, and with a radius of 1/2 inch. Also, when we are using Vpython and dynamically updating a graphic object, inside the loop that is adjusting the graphic, we have to issue a rate() command. The rate command tells vPython how many times a second you want to go through the loop. You need to play with this command, so that it gives smooth graphics for the rate at which the Arduino is sending data. rate(20) is sometimes a good starting point. So, our code now looks like this:import serial #Import Serial Librar\nfrom visual import * #Import all the vPython library\n \narduinoSerialData = serial.Serial('com11', 9600) \nmeasuringRod = cylinder( title=\"My Meter\", radius= .5, length=6,\n                             color=color.yellow, pos=(-3,0,0))\nwhile (1==1):  \n    rate(20\n    if (arduinoSerialData.inWaiting()>0):\n        myData = arduinoSerialData.readline() \n        print myData \n        distance = float(myData) \n        measuringRod.length=distance So, this is pretty cool! It creates a little rod, and the length of the little rod dynamically changes in response to how far your target is from your sensor. This gives a very nice qualitative visual to what is happening in the real world with your sensor. Often times you also want quantitative indication of the data.  We can do that by adding a label. Before the while loop, we will create a label object called lengthLabel. We will position it up just a little bit, so it is not on top of the measuringRod. We will set the label initially to \u2018Target Distance is: \u2018. We will also want to set box=false, since we do not want a box around our text. Then, a good height for the label is about 30 pixels. You can play around with all these settings. We create the lengthLabel before the while loop, but then inside the while loop we dynamically update the lengthLabel.text parameter. We set it to our myLabel string, which is dynamically being updated to be the concatination of the string \u2018Target Distance is: \u2018 and the string myData. Remember, myData is read as a string, and so we use that variable, and not distance, which is a number, not a string. Pulling this together leads to this code:import serial #Import Serial Library\nfrom visual import *\narduinoSerialData = serial.Serial('com11', 9600) \nmeasuringRod = cylinder( radius= .5, length=6, \n                          color=color.yellow, pos=(-3,0,0))\nlengthLabel = label(pos=(0,1,0), text='Target Distance is: ',\n                                        box=false, height=30)\nwhile (1==1): \n    rate(20)\n    if (arduinoSerialData.inWaiting()>0): \n        myData = arduinoSerialData.readline() \n        print myData \n        distance = float(myData) \n        measuringRod.length=distance \n        myLabel= 'Target Distance is: ' + myData\n        lengthLabel.text = myLabel Lets keep playing around with this. The graphic will begin to look more like a\u2019Virtual World\u2019 if we create a box to represent the target we are using in the real world.  I will make the box the dimensions of the real target, which is .2 X 3 X 3. Also, I will make it green, just like the target in the real world. In order to better fill our viewing window, I will move the cylinder down by about 2 inches, so its new position will be (-3,-2,0). For box type objects position is measured from the center, so I will need to also move the target box down by about .5, so it will coincide with the measuring rod. this is because 1/2 the target would be 1.5, and moving down by an additional .5 will make it coincide with the measuringRod.Finally, I need to dynamically update the position of the target box in the while loop. I will need it to be placed at target.pos=(-3+distance,-.5,0). Along the x-axis this will put it right at the end of the rod, and will keep it properly positioned in y, as before. Bringing all this code together we get:import serialfrom visual import * #Import all the vPython library arduinoSerialData = serial.Serial('com15', 9600) \nmeasuringRod =  cylinder(radius= .1, length=6,\n                          color=color.red, pos=(-3,-2,0))\nlengthLabel = label(pos=(0,2,0),text='Target Distance is: ',\n                                box=false, height=30)\ntarget = box(color=color.white, length=.3,width=4, height=2,pos=(0,-.5,0))\nwhile (1==1):\n    rate(20)\n    if (arduinoSerialData.inWaiting()>0): \n        myData = arduinoSerialData.readline() \n        print myData \n        distance = float(myData)\n        measuringRod.length=distance \n        myLabel= 'Target Distance is: ' + myData\n        lengthLabel.text = myLabel \n        target.pos=(-3+distance,-.5,0)Play around with the parameters until you get something you are happy with. Also, you can change your view of the visual once the program is running. Right mouse click and you can change your positional view of the virtual world you have created. Press and scroll the mouse wheel to change the zoom.OK, you need to start exploring and creating your own virtual world. Go ahead and see if you can create additional objects to make your virtual world more realistic. Try creating a graphic for the sensor itself, and maybe even your PC board and arduino!

GPSDO means: GPS disciplined oscillator. GPS for global positioning system. All GPS satellites are equipped with synchronized atomic clock. GPS module receives these signals from several satellites. And by triangulation, he knows his location. But here, what interests us is the pulse per second that is found on the module. With this precise pulse (from atomic clock), we can do a very very accurate oscillator. What for ? For reference, for calibration of frequency counter or just for fun to have one in his lab.They are many schematic on the internet. I have tried some. Some are good, one with a tiny2313 was 5 hertz too slow. But mine is the most simple, useful and convenient. And i'm giving you the .hex code. They are no VCO and no divider. Circuit with VCO are doing well. But, it must have a pulse signal of 10khz or more continuously. If antenna goes too weak, missing pulse or no pulse at all, the Oscillator (ocxo) is running by itself and the VFC (Voltage Frequency Control) isn't accurate anymore. The VCO feedback needs reference frequency to stick on. If not, It varies from a 1 to 2 Hertz! Also, the cheaper gps module doesn't work in this configuration. We must have at least 10khz to make a VCO. I tried with 1000 hertz. The gap was too large.The frequency varied. So with a ublox neo-6m you can't do a great vco gpsdo because maximum output frequency is 1000Hz. You must buy a neo-7m or upper.This is how my GPSDO YT works. The controller found the good adjustment for any OCXO with vfc 0 to 5v. If we loose GPs signal, the frequency doesn't move at all. When the signal reappears, the controller takes his last known good value and continue as before. On scope, with a reference oscillator. We can't tell when the signal is lost or when it came back. The signal is the same.After calibration, you can use the gpsdo without antenna if you want. A few mounts later you will have a very little drift. But.... how much larger ? It's time for some explanation.Here is some Math... Easy math, follow me with this it's easy. So far the algorithm has 6 phases. Each phase takes a sample of 1 to 1000 seconds, found the good pwm adjustment and go to most longer samples for more accuracy.Accuracy = (((Number of second x 10E6) + 1)/number of second) - 10E6Phase 1, 1 second sample for 10,000,000 counts for +- 1 Hz accuracyphase 2, 10 seconds sample for 100,000,000 counts for +-0.1Hz accuracyPhase 3, 60 seconds sample for 600,000,000 counts for +-0.01666 Hz accuracyPhase 4, 200 seconds Sample for 2,000,000,000 counts for +-0.005 Hz accuracyPhase 5, 900 seconds sample for 9,000,000,000 counts for +-0.001111 Hz accuracyPhase 6, 1000 seconds sample for 10 billions counts for +-0.001 Hz accuracyWorst case . When we get phase 6. This number can change a bit each 1000 seconds or not. some time it will be 10,000,000,001 or 9,999,999,999 So, +or - 0,000,000.001 variation for 1000s. Now we must know the value for 1 second.10Mhz = 1 secondFor 1 second = 10,000,000,001 count/1000s = 10,000,000.001 Hz (worst case for 1 second)10,000,000.001 - 10,000,000 = 0.001 Hz/s   faster or slower0.001Hz X 60 X 60 X24 X365 = 31536 Hz/yearsSo remember,  10Mhz is 1 second, 31536Hz X 1 / 10E6 = 0,0031536 second/ yearAnother faster method for calculation. one miss fo 10E9Mhz is 1/10E9= 1E-101E-10 x 60x60x24x365 = 0,0031536 second/year.Is that accurate enough for you?however, you must have a good OXCO. I prefer Double Oven 12v Sinus output. More stable, quiet and accurate. But i have same result with simple 5V. For exemple, a stp 2187 have a stability short time (allan deviation) of 2x10-12 = 0.000,000,000,02 Hz of stability. In the same time, when gps pulse is available, Avr will always correct pwm (frequency). The uC is always counting... always. This mean that on display you will not see date and time. When uC is sampling 900s, this one is busy for 900 seconds. It must count all clock. Problem is uC is running at 10Mhz. Each clock must be count. It is counting itself. If only one clock is missing the sample will not be good and pwm adjustement will not be right. I can't refresh display each second.When the sampling is started. Uc start to count timer0. Each 256 clock generates an interruption. X register is incremented. when it's full Y register is incremented and X reseted to 0 and so on. At the end, at he last one gps pulse, the count is stopped. And now and only now i can update display and do some math for pwm calculation.knowing that, i have only 25,6 us (256 clock before interrupt) to read and display time or other. It's impossible. One interrution can be buffed, not 2. I could refresh the time after 1000s... but it will be not pratical to see time with 15, 16 minutes interval. I have a watch, a clock, a cell phone to know time :) I'm doing a 10Mhz reference. Not a clock.Another problem i had, some avr instruction have 2 cycles. Including the rjmp instruction. This means if the first or last gps pulse came up at the same time of a 2 cycles instruction, the uC will miss a clock. Because uC will finish the instruction before begin the interrupt. So the counter will start or stop one cycle later. So i can't do a time wait loop... But in fact, i have no other choice. I needed to loop somewhere!! I So i'm using rjmp and  nop (this do nothing) instruction. Nop is an one cycle instruction. I have put 400 nop instruction for one rjmp on atmega48. 2000 on atmega88 and atmega328p version. So the chances are less to first or last pulse come at rjmp instruction. But yes it's possible and if this happen, this error will be corrected at the next sampling.The display is optional. You can do circuit with, uC, OCXO and low-pass filter (resistor capacitor) only, turn on and wait. After 1 hour you will have an acceptable frequency. But to reach phase 6. It takes a couple of hours.Pwm is 16 bits. 65535 step. 5v/65535 = 76,295 uVOCXO variation is 2Hz by 1V.  1v/76,295uV = 13107 step for 2 hz. 2/13107 = 152.59uHz by step of pwmThe phase 5, is changing pwm by 3, phase 6 is 2. step... Why 3 ? because 3 is changing frequency by 0.000,000,000,4 at 15 minutes scale. and 4 is my magic number in my algorithm. For exemple, if in phase one,  first frequency found is 10.000,003Mhz. I lower down by 0,000,000.4 step.Too large step can pass from 10.000003 to 10.000001 and after 9,999998Hz. I'm missing the target.With 0,0000004. It's quicker than 0,1 and i'm more sure of not bypass a number. And so on. I'm doing the same with 10 seconds, 60 seconds and 200s phase and 900s. 1000s is running mode and use a pwm step of 2Please note that phase 5 is more longer to achieve. The gap between 4 and 5 is larger. But it help to pass from 5 to 6 quicker.When phase 6 has counted exactly 10 billions, the pwm values is saved in eeprom. Now, it's time for the running mode. This one count 1000 seconds sample but with 2 step pwm only. At running mode, the real frequency is displayed and updated at 1000 seconds interval. If signal is lost in running mode it pass in self running. No change of pwm in this mode. When signal come back, it return to phase 5 to resynchronization.If circuit is unplug after eeprom is saved. This one will begin at phase 5 at power on with eeprom pwm value.For erasing eeprom value, just press the button at at start-up. Pwm 50% will be load and calibration will start from phase 1.I pass many hours to try different thing, configuration of the circuit. I did many tests, with OP amp, buffer and other chip. And at the end... the best result i got doesn't need it. Just a good stable power supply and some filtering capacitor.

Now sometimes the absentee ballot tells you how much postage but often they\u2019ll say to use appropriate postage. So is it over an ounce?\nThe miser in me figures this way: I live about five miles from the nearest town. That\u2019s ten miles round trip. My car gets around 30 mpg, so a trip to the post office (or to a polling place) is going to take one-third of a gallon or a little less than a dollar. To my friend who is taking college Algebra, here\u2019s an example of applied Algebra. So it\u2019s actually cheaper for me to mail in a ballot, than it is to drive in and vote. (I would do it anyway. I hate waiting in line). But I also don't want to underpay or overpay.\nOkay, so I thought, I bought an Arduino clone, how can I use it for weighing a letter? I found some sensors that could do it but they were quiet expensive, so I decided to go low tech. Another Instructable has a good postal scale:\nPretty Good Postal Scale from Old CDs\nhttps://www.instructables.com/id/Pretty-Good-Postal-Scale-from-Old-CDs/\nby Phil B\nAnd it\u2019s probably cheaper than mine.

The basic idea is equal lengths and equal weights balance (see Garfield picture).Non-essential Information: Algebra: I like to think of the balance scale (see first picture) as a visual example of the equal (=) sign. Everything on the left has to have the same weight as everything on the right. Which means whatever you do to one side, you have to do the same or equivalent to the other.\nUnfortunately, the ruler wasn\u2019t quite what I was hoping for. I was hoping for a hole in the middle and a hole equally spaced near the ends. So I needed to drill one hole to match up with the other end.Scientific: The scientific me say, how am I going to get the hole the exact same distance from the center and what if it\u2019s still not balanced? Will I have to shave it off?Practical: The practical me says it\u2019s not that critical, I have a calibration scheme to compensate and all I really care about is \u2018Is this letter less than an ounce or more than an ounce.\u2019\nSo I had to drill a not so critical hole in the ruler. What I did was: take my calipers to the side with the hole and adjusted them to the edge of the hole and the edge of the ruler, then I went to the other end and marked a line with my soldering aid tip. This made a square but you can\u2019t quiet see it in the picture. Then I scratched a line from corner to corner to get the center of the square. This matched up to the center of the hole on the other end. This may sound pretty complicated. Depending on the ruler you are using, just try to make holes to match the other side.CAUTION: Drill out the hole to the same size as the other one slowly and carefully. The plastic on a 33 cent ruler is thin and cheap. I know; I broke my first one.\n\u00a0", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSE/O7K8/GE38TB50/FSEO7K8GE38TB50.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5S/04F2/GE38R6NQ/F5S04F2GE38R6NQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYW/ILKU/GE39IJM9/FYWILKUGE39IJM9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSM/IF2K/GE38R6NM/FSMIF2KGE38R6NM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCX/AFZX/GE39IJMK/FCXAFZXGE39IJMK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Ruler Modification"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "In attaching the clips, I did use a little physics. My first thought was to bolts or just glue the clips to the ruler. But depending on where you clip the letter, the center of gravity will change and that would affect the balance, so I suspended the clips with some dental floss so the distance from the balance point would always be the same.\nSince most of us don\u2019t have calibrated weights in our junk pile (I used to), we need something common of a known weight and what is probably the best candidate are U.S. coins. Phil M already figured out that five quarters, 1967 or later = 1oz.\nHere\u2019s a reliable supporting website, the US Mint:\nhttp://www.usmint.gov/about_the_mint/?flash=yes&action=coin_specifications\nThe weight of a quarter is 5.67grams. 1 gram = 0.0352739619 ounces.\nWhat? Another Algebra problem? Well I already did this: one quarter = 0.20003oz. So five quarters are 1.000017oz. Close enough for government use.Non-essential Information: You may notice that all of the coins are a mixture of metals and the silver dollar is no longer a silver dollar and even the copper penny is no longer just copper. Over the years, prices of metal kept rising until the metal in the coins were worth more than the value printed on the coin. That\u2019s how the \u2018sandwich\u2019 coin was created. I just read an article that the metals in a 1932-1964 quarter is worth about $3.75.Calibration: I suspended the scale from a screw through the middle hole and clipped five quarters on each side. (See picture) It is a good idea to pull the ruler away from the door so the clips aren\u2019t dragging along the door. If it isn\u2019t balanced then take a paper clip starting near the center on the high side and slide it out until the ruler is level. (See second picture).

Make sure your subject object is squared nicely in your picture.  Take a picture from a point that is perpendicular to your subject.4     Download your pictures and open them up in MS Paint.TECHNO, GEEK, ENGINEER:1     I suppose a 3-d object could be your subject but to keep the math more realistic I prefer to only work with 2-d objects.  Other wise you will need to take depth/perspective and complicated scaling into  into account.2     Any object with a known size should work, ideally the larger the object the more accurate your measurements will be.  However, if your reference object is too large it may be easier to actually measure your subject instead.  Try to keep your known object in the same plane as your subject object because any offset in your plane will affect the accuracy of your work.3     A picture with a higher number of pixels/inch will result in a more precise measurement but this is just an estimator and there comes a point where the increased precision is useless.  Consider your goals/expectations and realities when when selecting the picture resolution.Square the subject object nicely in the picture because the amount the object is skewed from the reference axises is reduced and it helps to eliminate inaccuracy's and calculations.  When taking a picture remember to take a picture from a point that is perpendicular to your selected object, this will help to reduce skew errors with the picture.4     I wanted to use MS paint because it is a program just about everyone has and it is easy to work with.

If you intend to try this out remember  a couple of key points to make things easier. 1  Select a 2-D \"flat\" object.2  Select a reference object that is as large as possible.3  Take a picture from a point that is perpendicular and centered on the subject object.4  Try to keep the subject object as squared within the picture edge as possible.5  Keep your reference object as close to your subject object as you can.For the TECHNO, GEEK  ENGINEER in all of us.This instructable is not 100% accurate and could use some help.  Below are a list of potential errors as I see it and problems that I have not or failed to address.  Remember this is only intended as an estimator and not for truly accurate measurements.1  My subject object is pretty close to 2-D.2  My reference object is set about 6 inches or so back from the subject object, this introduces an additional scaling error.3  The picture was not taken from a point that is perpendicular to the subject object.4   I tried to simplify the math in for the CASUAL method so that the broadest community would understand what  I was trying to accomplish.5  The scale of the subject object would be larger on one end than the other because of perspective issues associated with the lack of perpendicularity.6  The vertical error measured on the 16 in framing square was less than the actual length of the object where as the vertical error on the side trim was more than the actual length of the object.  Although I knew about this problem I made the assumption that the error was bilateral and not just unilateral and so the error would be assignable to both sides of the actual measurement.7  The vertical error was assigned to the horizontal measurements.  This assignment may or may not be applicable.  I made the assumption that the vertical error was an approximately correct and applied this to the horizontal measurements as well.8  You can see that if proper care is taken the additional steps of finding the true length calculations are not necessary.  When one compares the CAUSAL to the TECHNO styles there is very little practical difference.  I believe that the TECHNO method would be more appropriate if the subject object was not squared as nicely within the picture.9  I do not believe that using a higher resolution graphics file would result in a more accurate measurement.  The precision in selecting individual points would increase but the additional time and effort in analyzing this type of file would increase.  Using a higher resolution photograph would also reduce potential error.  Personally, I would select a reasonable resolution graphic and work with this.  However, If you are working for the US Military and needed to select individual targets in some foreign country I would recommend using a higher resolution graphic.What is a practical application for this instructable?1 - Siding estimator - estimate the amount of siding needed for a wall.2 - Measure your ex-girlfriends apartment without stepping foot inside.3 - Figure out how far apart your neighbor's houses are4 -  Figure out the height of a flag pole5- etc. etc. etc.If you would like to learn more about this subject search the web for photogrammetry http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhotogrammetryKnowledge of descriptive geometry would also be useful if one was to seriously consider this type of work. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_geometryIf you have not seen it already, take a look at my other Instructables:https://www.instructables.com/id/Hanging-around/https://www.instructables.com/id/Volume_of_a_Cylinder_2/https://www.instructables.com/id/476_better_than_a_Bank/", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 8: What Have We Learned?"}], "channel": "No channel to show"}, {"category": "technology", "description": "Background and PurposeSome weeks ago a friend broke her forearm: she was on a bus whose driver violently pulled the brakes, and she fell down.

", "title": "ACCELEROMETER & LOGGER + MAKE & USE", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/ACCELEROMETER-LOGGER-MAKE-USE/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "What is Required?The list of materials for this accelerologger is as follows:1 Arduino Pro (5V, 16Hz)            1 module GY521 (with accelerometer and gyroscope MPU6050)            1 SD breakout board (and, yes, the memory card)            1 4-DIP switch            1 2-pin screw terminal            1 LED + 330 ohm resistor (I later added a second LED).            2 capacitor (100 nf)            1 perf board (5*7 mm, 2.5 mm pin spacing)            1 battery holder (4 LR6/AA, included please)            Pin headers and flexible wires (plain, pinned female)            Welding gear, plywood, glue, tools.Of course there are miriads of possible variations. In general, I have used what I already had in hand, and here I include few lines on my choices:I really, really, like the Arduino Pro: small, cheap, reliable, easy to use, tough and powerful. Still, it is a too big horse for this project, but it is the smallest that I have!            SD board/card: I'd rather use a microSD board/card, but the large one is what was available in my box, so... There are references of bad experiences with powering the board at 5 V (not the +5 V VCC pin, but the data transfer pins). I can only say that mine works OK at 5 V, so far.            The accelero/gyro GY521/MPU6050 seems to be a usual choice, so no regret on this regard. I am surprised by the amount of noise and requirements for calibration (see below), but I cannot compare to other accelero/gyros. I wonder if the analog units are better on this aspect.            LR6/AA batteries. The package required to reach the 6 V for the Arduino Pro is \"large\", and the first alternative is the 9V 6LR61/6AM6 \"rectangular\" battery. However, sometime ago I read that the energy density or delivered power of the 6LR61 is very low compared to the LR6, so I am not using them anymore. Also, it is very easy to find rechargeable R6/AA batteries. Finally I thought of LiPo batteries, but did not further develop (for no real particular reason).            I like welding (though I'm not that good), so, for me, welded PCBs are a good enough solution for relatively simple circuits. I also considered etching a printed circuit, but, apparently, some parts were missing in Fritzing and I preferered not to create them with their real dimensions etc. Finally, I definitely use headers for the main parts, so that after I'm tired of my circuit (or, ehem, it does not work) I can easily recover the main parts. (I know that this is probably a cause of faulty connections, but I take the risk).How Much does it Cost? Total cost, roughly (from where I normally buy, www.dhgate.com):Arduino Pro: 3.5 USD    GY521: 4.5 USD     SD board and card: 9 USD     Total: approx. 25-30 USD", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSZ/VEWX/I95GPDBW/FSZVEWXI95GPDBW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: BOM"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The Fritzing schematics are in a picture; the original file is uploaded here: Kindly note that some parts in the scheme are not exactly what I have actually used (namely the accelero/gyro board and the SD board): I have added some remark notes in order to provide further clarity on the wiring.Attached are also some pictures of the making process, from the protoboard to the final result.Two final notes regarding possible \"mistakes\":There are two capacitors, aimed at stabilizing the supply, although probably there should only be one, if any. Still, one is on the \"upstream Arduino\" side, and the other on the \"downstream\" part.        The Arduino Pro Mini board description mentions that \"If you're supplying unregulated power to the board, be sure to connect to the \"RAW\" pin on not VCC.\" The supply to the Pro is done on the VCC connection, either from the PC, through the USB adaptor, or through a battery - hope both are regulated enough! :-)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FO1/R9LB/I95GPEYG/FO1R9LBI95GPEYG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM2/8QFT/I95GPFSZ/FM28QFTI95GPFSZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F23/KAT7/I95GPDE3/F23KAT7I95GPDE3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLB/X0DV/I95GPDJ0/FLBX0DVI95GPDJ0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FON/H8PI/I95GPDBV/FONH8PII95GPDBV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2H/9Y2A/I9OSS467/F2H9Y2AI9OSS467.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Build It - Hardware"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Sketch UsedThe accelerologger runs with Arduino, and the code/sketch can be found here.Few comments on the general parts of the code:The 3 DIP switches which are coded (#2-4) are pulled-up with the pins' internal resistors. The action of the switches are:      DIP02: continuous reading. If the switch is off (pin high) the duration of the reading is defined by TimeR (time of reading), whose value is defined within the code. If the switch is on (pin low) the data reading and writing goes uninterrupted (actually there is a code line where this can be limited, by default I have set 2 hours).      DIP03: interrupts the reading. If the switch is off (pin high) the reading goes as specified by DIP02. If the switch is on (pin low) the reading & writing step is bypassed, but the timers are not stopped. This allows for a clean halt of the reading in case of need.      DIP04: calibration. If the switch is off (pin high) there is a calibration phase at setup. If the switch is on (pin low) the calibration step is bypassed.The DIP switch which is not coded (#1) powers the Arduino Pro from the batteries. Here the off position means switch disconnected (no-power).      The calibration function simply reads data and writes it to the SD card during a time defined within the code (TimeC). There is no use within the code of the calibration results, the purpose is just to gather information at a controlled stage. What use should be provided to this information is a matter of postprocessing (see next Step).      The data reading and writing frequency can be specified in the code (name of variable: frequency, in Hz). In order to adjust the timing an input is required: the average time of reading and writing (TimeDRW), which in my experience is 20-25 ms. The resulting frequency is not exact, just good enough for my purposes.      The yellow LED is on when things go OK (reading and writing), blinks slowly during preparation (setup) and completion of the data reading&writing. If there is a problem with the data (the x component of acceleration is -1 or 0), the red LED blinks for a short time; if the problem is related to the SD card, the red LED stays on. When there is a SD-related difficulty or the task has been completed the sketch enters a repose mode (infinite void loop) after informing with the corresponding blinking. MPU6050 and SoftwareRegarding the MPU6050:The communication with the board is done through the I2C protocol.       I have used the code prepared byJohn Chi at http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/MPU-6050.   Jeff Rowberg has extensively worked on libraries and code for this device (see https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib and  http://www.i2cdevlib.com), but for my purposes I found that Chi's approach was good enough through the Wire library.     The raw data read by the MPU6050 is in local coordinates. If global coordinates are required, the MPU6050 has an additional processor (DMP, Digital Motion Processor) which can provide the required calculations. This DMP also has error minimization capabilities. Access to the DMP results can be achieved through the libraries written by Jeff Rowberg.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJV/0RYE/I9OSS0XC/FJV0RYEI9OSS0XC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYR/0Y8C/I9OSS0XT/FYR0Y8CI9OSS0XT.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Build It - Software"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Why Do We Need to Calibrate? Isn't the sensor already calibrated from the factory? These are ten consecutive readings (accelerations followed by angular velocities; x, y,z in both cases) with the GY521 in standstill, vertical position (axis +X upwards): 17088 208 -1048     5    -1   -216        17028 308 -1320     4     3   -250        16988 360 -1212     7     3   -236        16876 376 -1032  -13  -36   -218        16972 244 -1348  -13  -25   -226        17060 316 -1156    -2   -11   -224        16948 328 -1300  -31      0   -224        17016 332 -1124      1    -1   -209        17088 348 -1088    -6   -27   -238        17072 284 -1104   -13  -24   -228If the device was really vertical, the readings for the accelerations should be (see below the reason):  (16384, 0, 0); and if the device was really still, the readings for the gyroscope should be: (0,0,0). So: the readings should all have been: [16384, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]: what's wrong? Or, is actually anything wrong?Three things are probably happening: the device is still, at least with no noticeable movement, but it is likely not perfectly vertical,        there is signal noise, and this is probably the cause of the fluctuation in the instant readings,        the readings are raw, not calibrated, which is why they are \"deviated\", on average.So, let's go step by step.ADC of the MPU6050The MPU6050 has an integrated ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) which outputs each channel (acceleration and angular velocities, each in x, y, z) in 16 bits. Therefore 2^16 different results are possible: 0 to 65535, or -32768 to +32767.  This range of readings is mapped in the standard configuration to +-2g in accelerations, and +-250 deg/s in angular velocities. Then 1 g corresponds to 16384 LSB (Less Signifficant Bit, or digital raw units of reading), and 1 deg/s corresponds to 131 LSB.Both ranges can be changed in the configuration settings via software through Jeff Rowberg's code (see previous Step). The possibilities are: Acceleration ranges: +- 2g, 4g, 8g, 16g        Gyroscopes ranges: +- 250, 500, 1000, 2000 deg/s.Note that because of the ADC's 16 bit constraint, extending the ranges of measurements decreases the sensitivities: the +-4g range mapped into a reading range of (-32768,+32767) gives 8192 LSB/g.So, the raw readings can be converted into \"physical\" units with the known sensitivities are: 1,042969 0,012695 -0,063965  0,038168 -0,007634 -1,648855        1,039307 0,018799 -0,080566  0,030534  0,022901 -1,908397        1,036865 0,021973 -0,073975  0,053435  0,022901 -1,801527        1,030029 0,022949 -0,062988 -0,099237 -0,274809 -1,664122        1,035889 0,014893 -0,082275 -0,099237 -0,190840 -1,725191        1,041260 0,019287 -0,070557 -0,015267 -0,083969 -1,709924        1,034424 0,020020 -0,079346 -0,236641  0,000000 -1,709924        1,038574 0,020264 -0,068604  0,007634 -0,007634 -1,595420        1,042969 0,021240 -0,066406 -0,045802 -0,206107 -1,816794        1,041992 0,017334 -0,067383 -0,099237 -0,183206 -1,740458        Units: g and deg/sGood, but ... what's the real result?  How many decimals can be properly used? I have selected 6 decimals, but why not 10?Manipulation of NumbersWhat we can say is that with a 95% confidence level (based on all the records of the calibration, not just the 10 shown here) the averages can be calculated with statistical tools and consideration of the rules of significant figures. See here the spreadsheet, whose results are: Ax = 17002 +- 5 LBS <->  1.038 +- 0.000 g       Ay =   328 +- 4 LBS <->  0.020 +- 0.000 g       Az = -1170 +- 6 LBS <-> -0.071 +- 0.000 g       Gx =  -1.9 +- 0.7 LBS <-> -0.014 +- 0.005 \u00ba/s       Gy =   0.6 +- 1.1 LBS <->  0.004 +- 0.008 \u00ba/s       Gz =  -227 +- 1 LBS <-> -1.730 +- 0.007 \u00ba/sClearly, just by looking at the results: the acceleration readings seem to be \"reliable\", and Gy is not.  But even these \"statistically corrected\" averages are still not what one would expect! Acceleration should be 1.000; and, in addition, one wonders why the average of Gz is so high if the device was not moving.So, enter calibration - at last!Calibration (of the Accelerometer)First remark: calibration is not intended to correct the results of a faulty sensor. If from the previous results we feel that sensor Gz is likely broken or miss-connected, then there is probably no calibration which can fix it.Second remark: a calibration compares readings, or readings with assumptions. Extrapolation beyond those readings requires care.The MPU6050 displays a theoretical linear relationship between the measured accelerations or angular velocities and the output. (The product specification datasheet mentions a \"nonlinearity\" of 0.5% and 0.2%, respectively; \"cross-axis sensitivity\", the amount of change introduced in one axis by the application of acceleration or angular speed on another axis, is 2%).Then,it might be possible to apply corrections to the converting equations. In the previous case, for the accelerations the correction of the gain error leads to: Ax(g) = (Ax(LBS)      )/(16384 + 618)Offset deviations might be also corrected: Ay(g) = (Ay(LBS) - 328)/(16384- 328)        Az(g) = (Az(LBS) +1170)/(16384+1170)This offsetting procedure could be correct IF we are sure that the accelerometer was really vertical (+X up) when the calibrating measures were taken - otherwise it is not correct. It may be that the error thus introduced is small, but it is nonetheless not correct. And, unfortunately, it is difficult to be sure of the accuracy of the verticality with which the MPU6050 is placed during the calibration.One alternative calibration procedure (the \"six positions test\") would be to read six times the acceleration results, with the device still. On each of these instances the sensor would be turned so that every time a different axis is on the \"vertical\" (+-x/y/z). The readings on each position for all axis provides enough information for a detailed calibration.A simple description of this procedure can be found here; more precise info here; more serious here.Regardless of the position of the sensor, if it is not moving, then the norm or modulus of the vector acceleration should be 1 g (or whichever is the gravity acceleration in your location). This can also be used for calibration purposes in any position of the sensor.Calibration (of the Accelerometer) other than with GTwo simple additional calibration tests seem possible, although I have not developed them:Free fall: An accelerometer in free fall should read (0,0,0), regardless of its spatial orientation. It will probably be difficult to collect enough data before applying an arrestor (from my 7th floor it will take the tester barely more than 2 seconds to reach the street).     Pendulum: A pendulum on whose bob is the GY521 would measure accelerations and angular velocities which are relatively easy to calculate.Calibration (of the Gyroscope)The standard procedure used for the calibration of the accelerometer can be used for the offset control of the gyroscope, but it provides no clue about the gain error. If the gain error needs to be checked, I assume that a calibrated pendulum might be required.How Much Time for Warm-Up? And for Calibration?A chart is attached showing the readings logged as quickly as possible after powering up the Arduino. No warm-up period is apparent - or, if there is any, it seems that is very short and of no practical effect for my purposes.The question of how much time is required for calibration data reading can be converted into a statistical issue: how many samples are required from a general population to accurately estimate the average? The answer is: as many as required in order to provide stable results. There are explicit expressions for the number of samples, but, in general and when feasible, it is preferable to make as many assumptions on the population as possible. An attached chart shows the evolution of the estimation of Ax with the sampling size. After 10-15 seconds of readings the results are quite stable, and my recommendation would be to read for 20-25 s at a frequency rate of at least 25 Hz.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FLC/DGSH/I98BK7T8/FLCDGSHI98BK7T8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6V/VMYY/I98BK7T9/F6VVMYYI98BK7T9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ5/L91R/I96W6NWH/FQ5L91RI96W6NWH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUZ/F098/I9GWATAE/FUZF098I9GWATAE.LARGE.gif"], "step_title": "Step 4: Use It - Calibration"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Onboard!So, get on board the bus and fix the accelerologger!Precautionary remarks, though:A bus is a complex dynamic element: not all its parts are moving equally or simultaneously. Of course, the bus as a unit is moving, and with it all its constituents (including passengers). But in addition to this solidary movement there are different behaviors which are reflected in the kinematics of the components. Front and rear, left and right, low and high; frame, seats, windows, doors, handrails: all have different movements.     Therefore, what the accelerologger will record is the acceleration and angular velocities of the ... MPU6050 (or so we hope!). How much does this differ from the conditions of another element of the bus to which the accelerologger may be attached is dependent on the dynamics of the element as well as on the attachment conditions and the dimentions/weight/etc of the accelerologger. A rigid connection is likely to introduce little distortion, while a floffy link can be expected to create quite different performances.     The bus is not yours. It may be a good approach to request permission from the transportation Company, or at least inform the driver of your purpose.

The answer is easy: as low as  you really need, or just a bit more to be safe. If you read too often,  you will likely get noise and tons of data which you may not know how  to use. OK then: what is the lowest samping data that you need?  Well,  It depends on your requirements! Sorry for the vagueness, but it may be  easy to understand with an example. If you drive at 100 km/h and want  to spot a bumper or a pothole which are 0.5 m long, a sampling rate of  less than 56 Hz is likely not to detect it, while a sampling at 150 Hz  will get 3 readings on the obstacle.  Now: will these 3 readings  be enough to be clearly separated from the background noise? Here I can  also not provide other answer that: \"Test it!\". (The theory says that if the sampling is done at a rate at least twice the maximum frequency included within the signal, then it is possible to recover the initial signal. Still an obstacle, though: it is not obvious which is the frequency of the signal in the example of the pothole, so tests seem to be necessary in any case. A numerical guidance to the pothole case: if there is a main frequency event once the car's wheel is, say, 5 cm off the pothole edge, then a sampling frequency of 1.1 kHz would be required).Nevertheless, some information that I have gathered on actual sampling rates: Normal personal activities: 2-10 Hz (for measurements on the body trunk).     Bus accelerations for driving quality measurements: 20-50 Hz (in some cases 1 kHz are mentioned...)Finally: remember that the maximum sampling  rate in my sketch is limited by the time required for reading and  writing, which in my case is about 20-25 ms per cycle. Therefore the  maximum sampling rate of my accelerologger is approx. 40-50 Hz. As a reference: the sample rate of the MPU6050 is 1 kHz for the accelerometer and 8 kHz for the gyroscope. On the interface: with a frequency of 400 kHz for the I2C, the maximum nominal transfer data rate is 2.6 kHz (17 bytes (accelerometer + temperature + gyroscope) at 9 (8+1) clock tics per byte). And at the other end, the transfer rate on the SD is (???).Although I have not digged on the subject, I assume that the relatively low sampling rate of this accelerologer is related to two of its features:(I think) I'm not using the asyncronous data transfer that the MPU6050 allows. Access to a FIFO buffer on the MPU can be managed through Jeff Rowberg's code.  The data storage is done opening and closing the storage file every time data is received from the MPU, which is likely a very slow process. This should be a quite easy task if a larger sampling rate is needed.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FLA/DYJ9/I9OSS61J/FLADYJ9I9OSS61J.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: What Sampling Frequency?"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "A Standard: EN 13816The standard EN 13816-2003 Transportation.

(See this for some information on people's accidents on buses).Reccommended AccelerationsThere does not seem to be a general agreement on appropriate accelerations on public ground transport systems. However, what I have been able to gather can be summarized as follows:Steady non-emergency longitudinal accelerations in the range 0.10 g to 0.15 g are acceptable in most cases.   If the passengers are properly seated, the tolerable for-and-aft acceleration levels can be higher, up to 0.20 g, as in a commercial jet  take off with usual average acceleration in the range of 0.25 g for a take-off velocity of  approx. 250 km/h (peaks can reach 0.5 g). As a reference: a VW Golf GTI  can reach 100 km/h in 7 seconds, or an average acceleration of 0.4 g.For for-and-aft decelerations in normal conditions, accepted values seem to be in a similar range of 0.10-0.15 g, with emergency brake levels of up to 0.3 g. Again, the standard car can brake at 0.6 g. (100 km/h require an actual braking distance of approx. 90 m - add to it, please, 60 m for perception and reaction).The previous figures are in line with the usual standards used in the design of roads: acceleration levels of 0.10-0.15 g in a longitudinal direction are considered manageable, and decelerations of 0.15 g as comfortable, as felt by standing bus passengers.   Upsetting acceleration values are related to jerk (acceleration rate change). Standing passengers have difficulties in maintaining their balance when the jerk is higher than 0.06 g/s. Values of longitudinal jerk larger than 0.30 g/s would seldom be acceptable for most public transportation.For transversal accelerations, values as low as 0.05 g are mentioned as threshold which cause losing balance in unsupported passengers.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FO4/W3F8/I9QWEEW7/FO4W3F8I9QWEEW7.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Public Transport Driving Quality"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Attached are images of the bus line that I have selected.

Y: acceleration or angular velocity, in LSB.The GY521 was placed with the axis +Z upwards, and the axis +X forward - because of this and the bus movement I have focused only on Ax and Gz (and checked Ay).   Ax>0 means acceleration, Gz>0 means turn to the left.  The time in the raw data records is in milliseconds. It can be converted into standard CET by adding 12:21:48 h:mm:ss (of the day 14.may.2015).  A log of the trip is attached here.The raw data seem quite noisy and confusing: after all, are they really worthy? Is there any valuable, clear reading?Mapping of the Raw Data to the Bus Track Fig. 4 shows the position of the main curves of the route followed by the bus on the Gz raw data chart.The results match not only because they are visually appealing, but because the times recorded on the manual log of the trip closely correspond to those recorded by the accelerologger.From time 180-480 seconds the bus was stopped, with the engine on, waiting to  adjust the turn-around time (the same happened from 1430 to 1560 s). Fig. 5 shows the corresponding Gz records, whose average for that period is -230 LBS. Refer to the offset error for Gz in the Calibration step. Fig. 6 is the result after applying to the previous data a moving average of approx 0.2 seconds (6 consecutive records).Figures 7 & 8 are zooms on bends A-B: the first one with the raw data and a cut-off level of +- 400 LBS, and the second after applying the moving average described above and the offset corrected. The rough integration of Gz along the period corresponding to the curve A yields a result of -10870 LBS, or 82.9\u00ba for the standard sensitivity of the gyroscope. The difference in geographical bearing for curve A is 83.2\u00ba, as per the quick calculations performed on the klm file (see also a chart in previus Step). This seems a quite reasonable comparison for a rather unsophisticated calculation.The analysis of the Ax data also provides worthy data, although somehow tougher to analize. From 480 to 700 seconds the manual log reports:481: depart from stop P348539: arrival to stop P349548: depart from stop P349563: traffic light stop599: depart traffic stop632: traffic light stop645: depart traffic stop662: arrival to stop P351Figures 9 & 10 show the corresponding records, the first one unfiltered, and the second as a moving average with the same parameters as for Gz above. Finally, figure 11 shows the detail from 520 to 570 seconds, where the effects of the automatic gear changes can be appreciated both in acceleration and deceleration. The results are not as clear as for the Gz case, but still the elements of the trip can be identified.Regarding Ay, fig. 12 shows the moving average for time 830-870 seconds, corresponding to curve A. The average velocity in this curve is estimated from the records as 2.4 m/s (8.6 km/h). The average angular velocity from the gyroscope readings is approx. 8.9 deg/s. The average radius of the curve is therefore 15.5 m (r=v/w). This is a reasonable figure for a relatively closed bend and a bus. The centrifugal acceleration is therefore 0.4 m/s2 (a = v\u00b2/r = w\u00b2*r), or 6127 LSB. This, however, is not precisely matching the readings of Ay, with peaks of 4000 LSB.Finally, the records show accelerations (fore-and-aft as well as transversal) which are far exceeding the recommended values for a confortable trip: at curves, brakes for stops/traffic lights  and also at shifting gears. This confirms my experience on a bus.Next Stops?Put a bit more of data filtering (especially on accelerations).Cross check values of accelerations.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FB3/LKUI/I9QWDJPJ/FB3LKUII9QWDJPJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXP/10IR/I9QWDJUR/FXP10IRI9QWDJUR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM4/139A/I9QWDJOM/FM4139AI9QWDJOM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDM/2SGZ/I9QWDJOP/FDM2SGZI9QWDJOP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC3/3EMG/I9QWDJOR/FC33EMGI9QWDJOR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQW/TF74/I9QWDJRF/FQWTF74I9QWDJRF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQN/FXIH/I9QWDJS2/FQNFXIHI9QWDJS2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDM/F0W7/I9QWDJTD/FDMF0W7I9QWDJTD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F81/B78F/I9QWDJU0/F81B78FI9QWDJU0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0C/7KKG/I9QWDJU1/F0C7KKGI9QWDJU1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F87/3NFK/I9QWDJVH/F873NFKI9QWDJVH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMM/1A4U/I9QWDJW4/FMM1A4UI9QWDJW4.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Results!!!"}], "channel": "Arduino"}, {"category": "technology", "description": "This instructable will walk you through how to make an accurate measurement with a triple-beam balance, as well as teach you how to account for measurement error with an uncertainty analysis.

It concentrates on the various aspects of the programming. This Instructable is meant as a reference for anyone trying to program an own detector. This Instructable is not about how to build a metal detector. For this see my other Instructables (using these approaches)Why? There are many great micro controller metal detectors available designs available (GoldPic, SurfPi, FoxyPi, Teemo DIY, TPIMD, FelezJoo and the TechKiwiGadgets designs here on Instructables). They use various micro controllers giving in most cases some explanation about the design, but not digging too deep into the programming, as some of them were programmed in assembler. As I did try to port some of the designs to Arduino my focus was mainly on the programming itself. During many hours of programming and testing various designs of Arduino based metal detectors I came to the point where I had a nice running detector (not too sensitive but working)  and had a pretty decent code for the detector. But looking at the code, I realized there were so many tricks and ideas implemented over the time, that a combined Instructable about how to build the detector and how to program it would be way to complex. Especially if only looking for a detector to build nobody would dig too much into the code, the code itself being usable for many other designs as well. So I decided to create this Instructable about the programming itself. This Instructable will cover the various aspects of timing, signal analyzing, data processing, data output (e. g. LCD) and testing, using interrupts and fast analog reads.Detector typesThere are different types of metal detectors. The most common types are Beat Frequency Oscillation (BFO), Induction Balance (IB) and Pulse Induction (PI). BFO and IB types of detectors are using continuous oscillations, the PI type uses a single pulse and analyses what happens thereafter. So the PI type of detector gives some nice period of time after the pulse to acquire data, analyze them, do some filtering and sending data out to displays etc. That is the reason why the PI detector was my first choice to start with.In the first versions, the timing and data acquisition was done as part of the loop() routine, creating some trouble in regard to exact timing etc. Later on, all the timing stuff etc. was transplanted into Interrupt Service Routines (ISR) so basically running in the background with only some data crunching and output routines in the loop().From this point on, the approaches described here can be used for other detector designs as well The current description focuses on PI detectors, as these were the circuits available and therefor could be tested in real life. Other designs like IB and BFO-ish will be tried out and documented at a later point of time.For the PI detectors two basic designs were used:the usual decay curve design (in my case without an additional OpAmp)the LC trap design, where the main pulse triggers a series of decaying oscillationsI did some separate Instructables about both designs which will be updated with the described approaches.", "title": "How to Program an Arduino Based Metal Detector", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Program-an-Arduino-Based-Metal-Detector/", "section": "technology", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "General thoughtsThe basic principal of a metal detector is, that the inductance / signal in a coil changes as a target comes near to the coil. The usual ways of identifying these changes is by measuring frequency shifts, decay times, change of voltage at a selected point(s) of time etc. Based on the capabilities of the ATmega328 based Arduinos these inputs can be measured by analog reads, digital reads or triggering external interrupts.This Instructable will cover these inputs.To get a sensitive detector, unfortunately the inputs will need to be measured quite fast. The ATmega running at 16MHz seems to be running fast, still in many cases this is too slow to use standard Arduino based routines. Various approaches \u201eoutside\u201c the standard Arduino routines will be given here to provide as much speed as possibleTiming, timing, timing\u2026..The crucial element of coil based metal detectors is the timing. Usually the signals are fast, so small errors in timing will lead to false readings making it difficult to obtain stable readings.The standard features for timing for the Arduino are routines like millis(), micros(), delay() and delaymicroseconds(). For most applications these routines work fine, for metal detector designs they do not perform that well.The resolution of millis() is 4\u00b5S according the reference. At the other hand, when looking at the oscillation frequency of the Arduino the delay between two pulses at 16MHz is 0,0625\u00b5S, which is 64 times the resolution. To obtain access to this 16MHz frequency for timing purpose, the most convenient way is to use the ATmega internal timers. There are in total three timers (timer0, timer1 and timer2). The timers can be set to be running at full 16MHz or lower frequencies by prescalers (dividers). The timers have different mode to behave, but in the simplest mode they simply count from 0 to a given value, trigger an Interrupt Service Routine (ISR \u2013 a small routine) and restart counting. This mode of operation is called Clear Timer on Compare (CTC). During the counting of the timer, at any time of the program the counter value can be accessed and copied to a variable. This is true for most of the time the Arduino is running. Unfortunately not only the timers trigger interrupts but many other events trigger interrupts as well. Therefore interrupts may occur at similar times, of even during the execution of an ISR. As each interrupt delays the execution of the current code this leads again to small misreadings or even completely missed values. To brings some order into this the ATmega itself treat the interrupts with different priority.Vector \tAddr\tSource  Interrupts definition\n1\t0x0000\tRESET\tExternal Pin, Power-on Reset, Brown-out Reset and Watchdog System Reset\n2\t0x0002\tINT0\tExternal Interrupt Request 0\n3\t0x0004\tINT1\tExternal Interrupt Request 0\n4\t0x0006\tPCINT0\tPin Change Interrupt Request 0\n5\t0x0008\tPCINT1\tPin Change Interrupt Request 1\n6\t0x000A\tPCINT2\tPin Change Interrupt Request 2\n7\t0x000C\tWDT\tWatchdog Time-out Interrupt\n8\t0x000E\tTIMER2_COMPA\tTimer/Counter2 Compare Match A\n9\t0x0010\tTIMER2_COMPB\tTimer/Coutner2 Compare Match B\n10\t0x0012\tTIMER2_OVF\tTimer/Counter2 Overflow\n11\t0x0014\tTIMER1_CAPT\tTimer/Counter1 Capture Event\n12\t0x0016\tTIMER1_COMPA\tTimer/Counter1 Compare Match A\n13\t0x0018\tTIMER1_COMPB\tTimer/Coutner1 Compare Match B\n14\t0x001A\tTIMER1_OVF\tTimer/Counter1 Overflow\n15\t0x001C\tTIMER0_COMPA\tTimer/Counter0 Compare Match A\n16\t0x001E\tTIMER0_COMPB\tTimer/Coutner0 Compare Match B\n17\t0x0020\tTIMER0_OVF\tTimer/Counter0 Overflow\n18\t0x0022\tSPI STC\t\tSPI Serial Transfer Complete\n19\t0x0024\tUSART_RX\tUSART Rx Complete\n20\t0x0026\tUSART_UDRE\tUSART Data Register Empty\n21\t0x0028\tUSART_TX\tUSART Tx Complete\n22\t0x002A\tADC\t\tADC Conversion Complete\n23\t0x002C\tEE\t\tREADY EEPROM Ready\n24\t0x002E\tANALOG COMP\tAnalog Comparator\n25\t0x0030 \tTWI \t\t2-wire Serial Interface (I2C)\n26\t0x0032 \tSPM READY \tStore Program Memory ReadyThe goal in the programming of stable timing is therefor to use the highest prioritized interrupts as possible and to find ways of preventing other interrupts of occurring during the ISR. This leads to the first rule in dealing with interrupts: Keep the ISRs small! (.. I will be violating this rule on a regular basis\u2026).As the standard Arduino functions know about these timers as well, quite some of the routines and libraries are using them. This means, that if we are using the timers and changing their preset values, some of the standard routines do not work anymore. This needs to be kept in mind.Delay, tone, sensor, stepper, PWM functions as well as communications might not work properly anymore.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: Basics - Timing, Timers, Interrupts..."}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "There is a great Instructable about how to use timers. I used this Instructable a reference, will only give some abstracts here. In case you want to look deeper into the timers, see the Instructable \u201eArduino Timer Interrupts: 6 Steps (with Pictures)\u201c. The basic principle is, that first of all you tell the timer0, timer1 or timer2how fast it should run (prescaler in register TCCR0B, TCCR2B, TCCR2B)to what value should be counted (value in register OCR0A, OCR1A, OCR2A)what to do at this point (settings in TCCR0A, TCCR1A, TCCR2A -> reset and restart, trigger a PWM signal etc\u2026)set the counter to a given value to start with (value in TCNT0, TCNT1, TCNT2)enabling the relevant interrupts (setting in TIMSK0, TIMSK1, TIMSK2) \u2192 this will call the ISRThen you define the ISR with the interrupt vector name e. g. ISR(TIMER0_COMPA_vect) and define what should be done during this ISR. Again, this code should be kept short, as this code can be interrupted by other interrupts at any time, which will corrupt values or lead to a crash of the program.An additional portion of information is, that the timer0 and timer2 can count to 255, the timer1 can count to 65535. How to use timers for the metal detectorAs said previously, timing is crucial for metal detectors. So all the timing relevant stuff will be done by using timers.Usually, there is an initial pulse provided to a coil. After that the reaction of a coil (could be the same coil or a different coil) is measured. During this period of measuring ALL OTHER interrupts should be prevented! Interrupt during this time, will either lead to slightly off-values, corrupted values, missed values.I use the timers for 3 different purposes:timer0 for the main event (e. g. the pulse for a pulse induction detector)timer1 for data acquisition (e. g. frequency shift detection, timing of analog to digital conversion)timer2 for tone/volume generation.timer0The main cycle of a pulse induction (PI) detector consists of two phases. Fist there is the pulse to power the coil, then there is the silence where data acquisition takes place. In case of a PI detector the pulse has a normal duration of around 250\u00b5S the silence after the pulse should be enough for data acquisition, processing and updating outputs.  So timer0 is first set to a desired \u201eevent-speed\u201c at one hand providing a pulse near to 250\u00b5S and a usable silence time. For a 200Hz PI detector this would be a prescaler of 1024 (aka 16MHz / 1024 = 15.625kHz \u2192 64\u00b5S per cycle) with a compare counter of \u201e4\u201c for the pulse and a silence counter of \u201e72\u201c.  // set timer0 - taking care of the pulse to the coil and the pause between two pulses \n// Pulse composes of 4.672ms \"off\" (72) and 0.32ms \"on\"(4)  \n// separate times for OCR0A will be set in the interrupt routine \n// Resulting frequency is 200Hz \ncli(); \nTCCR0A = 0;  // set entire TCCR0A register to 0 \nTCCR0B = 0;  // same for TCCR0B \nTCNT0 = 0;  // initialize counter value to 0\n// set compare match register to required pulse with \nOCR0A = 72;  // = (4672\u00b5S/(0.0625\u00b5S * 1024)) - 1 (must be <256) \n// turn on Clear Timer on Compare (CTC) mode \nTCCR0A |= (1 << WGM01); \n// Set CS01 and CS00 bits for 1024 prescaler \nTCCR0B |= (1 << CS02) | (1 << CS00); \n// enable timer compare interrupt \nTIMSK0 |= (1 << OCIE0A); sei();As the signal is very unsymmetrical the trick is, to set the value 4 and 72 at each interrupt. The ISR look basically like this (with a global volatile boolean \"toggle\"):ISR(TIMER0_COMPA_vect){ \nif(toggle){ \n  cli(); \n  OCR0A = 72; \t// set for a long \"off-time\" -> next interrupt timer0 in 4.672ms \n  sei(); \n} \nelse{ \n  cli(); \n  OCR0A = 4; // set for a short \"on-time\" -> next interrupt timer0 in 320\u00b5S \n  sei();\n} \ntoggle=!toggle; \n}Of course during the if\u2019s and the else\u2019s there is some additional code for setting outputs as well.timer1As the timer1 has the highest counter value (65535) is can be used to measure \u201clong\u201d periods of time with high precision. At maximum speed (16MHz) the longest event before an overrun is 4.1ms. If the change in timing of an event is small, the overruns can be even ignored. The maximum timing resolution is then 0.0625\u00b5s! That is the background timer1 is used for the data-acquisition.First of all he timer is set for maximum speed cli(); \nTCCR1A = 0;             // set entire TCCR1A register to 0 \nTCCR1B = 0;             // same for TCCR1B \nTCNT1 = 0;              // initialize counter value to 0 \n// set compare match register \nOCR1A = timer1MaxValue; // just a value to start with -> set to a long period \n\t\t\t// to prevent unwanted interrupt interference \n// turn on Clear Timer on Compare (CTC) mode \nTCCR1B |= (1 << WGM12); \n// Set CS10 no prescaler \u2192 running at full 16MHz \nTCCR1B |= (1 << CS10); \n// enable timer compare interrupt \u2192 calling the ISR \nTIMSK1 |= (1 << OCIE1A); \nsei();To start the data acquisition the timer0 restarts the timer1 after every pulse by setting the counter of timer1 to 0 ( TCNT1 = 0) . Now there are two option for data acquisition:Waiting for an event to happen, and use timer1 to see when it happened, by reading the counter  TCNT1.time an event like analog read at a specific time (using the preset compare value of timer1) after the pulse.In the first case an ISR (e. g. analog comparator, or pin change) will read the TCNT1, e. g.ISR(ANALOG_COMP_vect){\t\t// for analog comparator @ pin D6 and D7 \n  Toggles[toggleCounter]=TCNT1; \n  toggleCounter++;\n}\n In the second case the compare value OCR1A is set to value where the timer1 compare ISR will be called and an analog read will be performed. During the ISR the compare value OCR1A can be changed to a new value to repeatingly perform analog to digital conversion (ADC) cycles e. g.ISR(TIMER1_COMPA_vect){ \ncli(); \nOCR1A = timer1PauseValue;  \t// set the next interrupt to the value where a \n\t\t\t\t// next ADC will give a usefull value \nADCSRA |= (1 << ADSC);     \t// ADSC -> start the cycle -> will be cleared \n\t\t\t\t// after the conversion is done \nsei(); \n}timer2The easiest way of indicating targets is by sound. When searching for treasures, your eyes are normally focused on where to search. So they are not available to look to a display or LED. Using sound makes it easy to find the exact location when looking at the coil and listening simultaneously. To provide precision and some feeling for the target, the tone should change its volume according to the strength of the signal. So to my opinion there should be a volume modulation implemented for the speaker.This is simply done by a 32kHz PWM signal to a speaker. A standard speaker is to slow to transform a 32kHz signal to a tone. The 32kHz is \u201cinterpreted\u201d rather as an analog value. By providing an audible frequency where the \u201con\u201d-pulses consist of a 32kHz signal with varying PWM proportions the volume of the audible tone van be varied.Timer2 has the nice feature that it is the hard-wired PWM function to the pins D3 and D11These pins can be activated to PWM by setting the bits in COM2x1 (COM2A1 and COM2B1) in the register TCCR2A. Register / output A is D11 and register / output B is D3. By setting the \u201ehow to behave\u201c to \u201cfast PWM\u201d, the PWM is set to drive the pin directly without needing any ISRs! The compare value OCR2A sets the PWM ratio (OCR2A=0 \u2192 0% positive wave \u2192 0V; OCR2A=255 \u2192 100% positive wave\u2192 5V).OCR2A and therefor the PWM ratio can be set at any place in the code to change the volume.Now that we have the volume, we still need to create the audible tone/frequency. This can be done with one of the other timers in their ISR (e. g. setting OCR2A = \u201cvolume\u201d after the data acquisition and setting OCR2A=0; when starting the pulse. That creates audible tone of 200Hz).", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 2: How to Use Timers"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Analog reading, but really fast.By using analogRead() it is possible to read a 10Bit value with good precision and stability. Unfortunately the maximum sampling rate is about 10kHz. This is partially due to some additional code in analogRead() partially due to the prescaler of the clock for the AD-Conversion.Fortunately the Instructable \u201eGirino - Fast Arduino Oscilloscope\u201c provides all the information about how to obtain higher sampling rates. Just by uncommenting the relevant line, the sampling of the Analog to Digital Conversion (ADC) speed can be set.// ADCSRA |= (1 << ADPS2) | (1 << ADPS0);   // 32 prescaler for 38.5 KHz \nADCSRA |= (1 << ADPS2);                   // 16 prescaler for 76.9 KHz \n// ADCSRA |= (1 << ADPS1) | (1 << ADPS0);  // 8 prescaler for 153.8 KHzTo use the ADC, there are three basic ways:free running mode \u2013 each time a conversion is finished the specific ISR is called.single conversion with interrupt \u2013 after a conversion is complete the ISR is calledsingle conversion and \u201edelaying\u201c until the value is available (like in analogRead())Although the free running mode achieves definitively the most samples during a given time, I do not recommend to use it for metal detecting purpose. Why? Due to the low priority of the interrupt (see interrupt priority table): it is at priority 22! The first few readings will most likely be precisely timed. After that, other interrupts will start to interfere and delay the ADC slightly. Will lead to small but significant deviations in timing of the ADC, thus leading to deviations in the ADC values.So what I really recommend to use is the timer1 triggered measurement by single conversion with interrupt.So each ISR of timer1 triggers a ADC simply by setting ADCSRA |= (1 << ADSC);About 270 (theoretically 208) xtal cycles later, the \u201cI-am-finished-with-the-Analog-to-Digital-Conversions\u201d ISR(ADC_vect) is called, and the value can be read. At the prescaler of 16, only 8bit out of 10bit resolution can be used, as the lower two byte will not give precise values (see data sheet) at high speeds.As the ADC will be done in the background on hardware-level, so this timeframe can be used to execute some commands during the ISR for storing the value and limiting the amount of measured values etcFor some applications the dynamics of the signal is far away from what should expected to deliver good results (seeing a complete wave during a single AD conversion). Still this seems not to be a big issue. This is most likely due to the internal sample and hold circuit inside the ATmega chip witch seems to work pretty well!Serious Bit-Banging at digital portsAt some instances the outputs of the Arduino have to be set. This can easily been done by using digitalWrite(). Still the functions have some additional overhead code what makes them slow(er), and thus needing quite some cycles.As some of the outputs are changes during ISRs, bit-banging the ports is a way better choice.The basic functions are:PORTD = PORTD | B00000100;  // setting D2 high without changing other portsPORTD = PORTD & B11111011; // setting D2 low without changing other portsPIND = PIND | B00000100;  // toggling D2 if low \u2192 high; if high \u2192 lowThe allocation of the ports are bitwisePORTD  D7    D6    D5     D4     D3     D2     D1(TXD) D0(RXD) \nPORTB  N.A.  N.A.  D13    D12    D11    D10    D9      D8 \nPORTC  A0    A1    A2     A3     A4     A5     Reset   N.A.For the powering of the coil the ports should be directly set to HIGH or LOW, for the tone output the PIND command (toggling) allows for a neat feature: Multi Tone Target Identification.If we have two points during a cycle where we toggle the pin for the speaker we can decide if we toggle the pin at both points or just at one, depending on the target. By doing this we achieve a high tone (two toggles per cycle 200Hz) or a low tone (one toggle per cycle 100Hz).Using pins for testingEspecially during experimenting with a newly developed circuit and new code it is very useful to drive an additional pin to indicate what is happening in the code. This can be used either to trigger an oscilloscope, or at some instances to show how long a certain routine in the code takes. By setting the pin high at the beginning of a routine and setting it low after it, it can be nicely seen if this piece of code interferes with interrupts or other signals or to compare which version of code is faster or slower. That became handy for the I2C problems.Attached is a picture of the analog signal (red) and the signal of a pin indicating how long the AD conversion takes.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FE7/ZJI0/JCUUMO49/FE7ZJI0JCUUMO49.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Using Digital and Analog Pins"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "The main target of a detector is, to find a target and then give some information about the target to the user. One way of indicating a target is by using the speaker as explained at timer2. There are other ways, to be described.Serial Output.This is mainly used for testing and experimenting, but it is unbeatable!Serial.print() and siblings are extremely fast (if set to Serial.begin(115200)). So while trying out your circuit and get a feeling for the readings, Serial.print() can be used to send serious amounts of data to the computer. If formatted in a decent way (e.g. \u201espace\u201c between values, \u201ereturns\u201c between cycles) large amount of data can be transferred for later analysis by copying the outputs from the serial monitor to Excel or similar spreadsheet programs (I am using Libre Office).I used this extensively, and one of the detector project will incorporate to use this to print data to a 16x2 LCD at a later point of time.16x2 LCDI think this is a good way to give some additional information about the target. This can incorporate the signal strength, but at the same time provide a menu to navigate through potential settings (sensitivity, auto balancing, power, discrimination).There are two simple ways to drive a typical 16x2 LCDdirect wiring with a 4 bit transferredusing a I2C backpackI know, that there are UART packpacks as well, but they are not so common as the I2C backpack.The direct wiring is straight forward, but cumbersome, as many ports are used and some wiring is necessary. So the simplest way to use a 16x2 display should be using the I2C backpack. SHOULD BE!! Unfortunately there are some real topics here:it seems that it is using timer0 during start upI2C is incredibly slow!!!It is connected to A5 and A4.1. During lcd.begin(16,2); apparently the delay() and siblings are used (funnily enough only there). This means, that if we like to use these timers for other purposes as we do, we have to call lcd.begin(16,2) prior to setting the timers for our purpose (did cost me a bit of time\u2026.). The other calls of the LCD do not use the timers or, can live at least with modified timer settings.2. The biggest drawback was definitely the speed of I2C. During the first implementation of sending all the information to the LCD, the LCD would not show anything at all, it would just hang. I realized that sending 32 characters including a lcd.clear() was too much, so I reduced the amount to 2 characters. But even sending two characters took about 3 milliseconds, which is too long. At 200Hz working frequency the cycle consists of a 300\u00b5s pulse and 4.7ms \u201esilence. This \u201esilence\u201c is used for data acquisition (about 2.5msin my case) and data crunching (1ms in my case) leaves about 1.1ms for the LCD output. Experiments showed that even one single character takes about 1.5ms. To solve this problem the routine Wire.setClock(400000) was quite useful. Normally the I2C clock is set to 100kHz by default. By using Wire.setClock(400000) the clock can be set to 400kHz. The 100kHz default is set in the wire.begin(). This routine is called during lcd.begin(). So the Wire.setClock(400000) must be called after the lcd.begin() (\u2026. again some hours frustration).Still the issue had to be solved, that only one character could be send per cycle. To solve this, an array (16x2 characters \u2192 32 characters in total) was created, being filled with all required information for display. This array is than read one character per cycle and send to the display. 3. the I2C is by default connected to the A4 and A5. What became apparent during testing is, that driving the I2C bus is destabilizing the voltage at the analog pins (probably to all pins, but the analog pins are sensitive as it effects the ADC). This leads to the timing issue, that all I2C transmissions should be well separated to any sensitive ADC cycles.So by setting the I2C clock speed to 400kHz and sending out only one character per cycle the duration of communication to the LCD could be reduced to be finished before the next pulse was send to the coil. So A4 and A5 were nicely quite when starting the data-acquisition at the pin A0 after the pulse. The refresh rate of the LCD is therefor 200Hz/32 characters \u2192 6.25HzSoundAs discussed in the step about the timers, timer2 is used to generate a dynamic sound output for the detector. A simple speaker connected via a 100 Ohm resistor to the port A (D11) or B (D3) give a nice feeling for the signal strength and type of target (if Multi Tone Target Identification is used). To achieve this the code is not realy nice, but doing the job.At two places in the code, timed by the timer0 and eg after dataCrunching there are two snippets of code driven by the booleans \"sound\" and \"pitch\"if((sound)&&(highPitch)) { // if the speaker should sound and at high pitch  if(OCR2A)\n    OCR2A=0;\n  else\n    OCR2A=volume; \n}if(sound){            \t// if the speaker should make noise \n if(OCR2A)\n   OCR2A=0;\n else\n   OCR2A=volume;  \n}\nelse\n  OCR2A=0;Setting the booleans \"sound\" and \"pitch\" should be done at other places in the code as they are not time critical.Same counts for the variable \"volume\" as an unsigned char or byte.LED As there is usually a LED present at D13 on all Arduino boards I use this LED aswel, setting the pin by bit-banging described in the last step. During testing this gives a good impression what is currently going on, for later use, the pin can be used to drive an external LED.Attached are screenshots from different timing, made visible by an external pin. The initial pulse can be seen, than some wild oscillation. During the oscillation the data acquisition takes place. After the data acquisition the data crunchings starts (yellow signal set to high). At the end of all data crunching and data transfer the yellow signal is set to low. The pictures show the difference in duration of:only data crunchingdata crunching and sending out 50 values via Serial.print()data crunching and sending out ony 1 character to the LCD via I2C @ 100kHz", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F84/1NVE/JCUUMOTV/F841NVEJCUUMOTV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU2/B9UB/JCUUMOR9/FU2B9UBJCUUMOR9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMJ/GE0T/JCUUMOR7/FMJGE0TJCUUMOR7.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Interfaces and Data Output"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "In an ideal world, the received signal would be crystal clear, and the smallest change compared to a reference would indicate a target. Unfortunately the world is not ideal and the signals in a metal detector are noisy and dirty (especially when using so few external components as I do). To filter out the relevant part of the data, some approaches were tried out to filter the received data and even some useful ones were found.The first point of optimization is the circuit!If the circuit and the coil are scrap, not the best filtering algorithm can help you.There are some general rules, like using big condensers. Shielding the circuit will help as well and should be experimented with. One thing what really makes things difficult are spikes in the signal. If the signal goes higher than 5V or lower than 0V there are some internal circuits protecting the ATmega from blowing up. This works only if the currents are kept low. For protection this works well, for the stability of the program this is not as good.Having worked with quite \u201edirty\u201c signals, the code had hick-ups and the ADC cycles had major misreadings. This can lead to small delays in readings, missed readings, or plain unexplainable values. Optimizing the circuit is the first step to decent data. Here some individual testing needs to be done for your circuit. Approaches are:keeping connections shortusing capacitors to stabilize the supply voltagepreventing large loads on Arduino pinspreventing high currents in proximity to sensitive parts / connectionspreventing heating up/ cooling down of componentsshielding components, connections, complete circuitstwisting wirespreventing moving / lose wiresknowing what you are doing\u2026..How to interpret measured valuesThe simplest approach to identifying changes to the measured signal is in comparing the signal to a reference value for the signal. If the measured value is different to this reference value then you found something.Reality proves different.In reality you will have small deviations in your readings. These deviations are due to signal interference from the 50/60Hz signal from the main grid, high frequency signals from poorly shielded devices (AC-adaptors, computers), interference to other wireless signals (Wifi, GSM) or simply oscillations as a result from the circuit design. These interference can deviate from a reference value in such a magnitude, that the sensitivity of the detector can be rendered useless.In the next parts different approaches explained for dealing with noisy signals.Creating meansCreating a mean value over the last few values is a good point to start. This way small deviations in positive and negative direction will be leveled out. Depending on the magnitude and appearance of the noise the amount of values to create the average might be choosen differentlyThe easiest way is to define an array and fill your obtained values into this array, increment by each cycle. Each cycle you add up all the values, and compare them to the reference. Small deviations will be eliminated. This is easily implemented by a global counter which is incremented by each cycle. If it reaches a \u201emaxValue\u201c, it is set to 0.Each cycle, a for-loop counts from 0 to the \u201emaxValue\u201c to grate the sum. Dividing the sum by the maxValue can be done does not really makes sense. The reference value could compare directly to the sum.Advantage: easy to implement, fast code, simple to read.Disadvantage: small delay (which is probably not relevant), only usable for little noise#define maxValue 20 \nint valueCounter=0; \nint valueSamples[maxValue]; \n\nvoid dataCrunching(void ){\nint i;\ndouble average;\n  valueSamples[valueCounter]=nextValue;\n  valueCounter++;\n  if(valueCounter>(maxValue-1))\n    valueCounter=0;\n  average=0;\n for(i=0; i<maxValue; i++)\n   average=average+valueSamples[i];\n}Observing bordersif the signal is too volatile an other approach could be looking at the minimum or maximum values in an array. This is especially useful, if the signal has the tendency to deviate especially in one direction. Again an array is used, filled with one value per cycle. Each cycle the array is checked for the e. g. lowest value. This value is then compared to the reference value. Creating e. g. the lowest value can be done, by giving a variable a high value to start with (e. g. 255) and then checking in the for-loop if the given array value is smallerif(minValue<array[i])  minValue=array[i];after the loop minValue has the smallest value of the array.Advantage: even noisy signals can be analyzed pretty wellDisadvantage: array need to be large enough (can slow down reaction speed)#define maxValue 20 \nint valueCounter=0; \nint valueSamples[maxValue]; \n\nvoid dataCrunching(void){\nint i;\nint minValue;\n  valueSamples[valueCounter]=nextValue;\n  valueCounter++;\n  if(valueCounter>(maxValue-1))\n    valueCounter=0;\n  minValue=32767;\n  for(i=0;i<maxValue;i++){\n    if(minValueminValue=valueSamples[i];\n  }\n}Ignoring ValuesSometimes the there are some glitches in the signal or plain misreadings. If these values are added to the array, they will completely corrupt the analysis of the array. To prevent this, values which are \u201enot trustworthy\u201c can be filtered out by setting \u201eexpectation-borders\u201c. The simplest way of doing so, is to look at the average in the array and only accept values in a +/- range of the average. I do not recommend to do so! Why not? It might lead to the situation, that the average value get \u201estuck\u201c. If the readings are slowly going up, and then suddenly back to \u201enormal\u201c, the average values will stuck with the high values, as the normal values might be out of the +/- range.Better to use the reference value for this.If the signal is outside of a +/- range in regard to the reference value in the array is just not replaced, the old value remains in the array. This leads to an array full of values in the same range. Comparing the average of the array to the reference value will be quite sensitive to small changesAdvantage: good way to filter out glitches and major misreadings, even small changes can be detected in a noisy signal.Disadvantage: enough values need to be within the range, reference value and range should be chosen with care.#define maxValue 20\nint valueCounter=0;\nint valueSamples[maxValue];\nint limit=10;\nint referenceValue;\t// needs to be created somewhere in the program!!!\n\nvoid dataCrunching(void){\nint i;\nint diff;\n  diff=abs(nextValue-referenceValue)\t\t// create the difference\n  if(diff<limit)\t\t\t\t// if difference larger than \"limit\"\n    valueSamples[valueCounter]=nextValue;\n  valueCounter++;\n  if(valueCounter>(maxValue-1))\n    valueCounter=0;\n  average=0;\n  for(i=0;i<maxValue;i++)\n    average=average+valueSamples[i];\n}Average single valuesOne way of filtering out small deviations is to use the previous value multiply it by a factor add the new value and divide by the (factor+1). Advantage: very easy to implement, filters out small noiseDisadvantage: ignores small changes, even if they are persistent (new value needs to deviate more than \u201efactor\u201c to influence the result after the division)#define maxValue 20\nint valueCounter=0;\nint valueSamples[maxValue];\nint factor=3;\n\nvoid dataCrunching(void){\nint i;\ndouble filterValue;\n  filterValue=valueSamples[valueCounter];\n  filterValue=filterValue*factor;\n  filterValue=filterValue+nextValue;\n  valueSamples[valueCounter]=filterValue/(factor+1);\n  valueCounter++;\n  if(valueCounter>(maxValue-1))\n    valueCounter=0;\n  average=0;\n  for(i=0; i<maxValue;i++)\n    average=average+valueSamples[i];\n}Using higher/lower counterIn this case the measured value would be compared to a previously created average. If the value is larger then the average a counter diffCounter would be incremented. If the value is smaller, the diffCounter would be decreased. If the diffCounter reaches a maximum value maxDiffCounter, the average is incremented and the diffCounter is set to 0. If the diffCounter goes below 0, the average is decreased and the diffCounter is set to maxDiffCounter.Advantage: even very noisy signal can be analyzed.Disadvantage: the distribution of high/lows should be \u201estable\u201c, indications of deviations could be pretty slow#define maxDiffCounter 30\nint diffCounter=0;\nint referenceValue;\t   // needs to be created elsewhere in the program!!!\nint sampleValue;\nint average=0;\n\nvoid dataCrunching(void){\nint i;\ndouble average;\n  if(nextValue>referenceValue)\t\t// if larger than the reference\n    diffCounter++;\t\t\t// increase the diffCounter\n  else if(nextValue<referenceValue)\t// if smalle than the reference\n   diffCounter--;\t\t\t// decrease the difCounter\n  if(diffCounter>maxDiffCounter){\t// maximum value reached\n    average++;\t\t\t\t// correct the average\n    diffCounter=0;\t\t\t// restart at 0\n  }\n  else if(diffCounter<0){\t\t// minimum value reached\t\n    average--;\t\t\t\t// correct the average\n    diffCounter=maxDiffCounter;\t\t// restart at maximum value\n  }\n}\tCreating reference ValuesThe easy part in the data crunching ware the different approaches to filter out noise. A different topic is how to create a reference value to measure against.Again there are different approaches with different advantages and disadvantages. There are different ways to use an external input to obtain a reference value. using a push button, when pressed the recent value will be used as a referencehaving a dial to set a proper referenceusing push buttons +/- to set a reference value.They are old school except for variant one, which can be used for pin pointing targets as well.Still the more convenient way is to have an algorithm in place to create this value. I would create a first routine called calibrate() where I would have a \u201cwarm-up\u201d of the circuit and then a period of time where I would create an average value with the minimum of filters set. Why minimum filters? The reference will have a start value of 0 or any other value. Except if the proximate value is know (stored) the real value can be either near or far from this initial value. So we need to move freely towards the real reference.The second step is then to average the reference with all required filters just to find the \u201creal\u201d reference. At that point of time you will have a good reference.Now we will have to deal with drift. Drift can occur due to temperature drift or to a change of the characteristics of the soil. So some kind adjusting of the reference value is useful.My personal approach is to use a higher/lower (as decribed) counter for this. To prevent too fast changes of the reference value, the maximum counter value for changing the reference value can be set quite high (100-500) this compensates temperature. This maximum value for the counter could be set via a menu according to the users requirementUsing a push button approach for a pin pointing mode of operation would simply disable the adjustment of the reference value.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FLB/L2VJ/JCUUMRYG/FLBL2VJJCUUMRYG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHN/NFWH/JCUUMRYI/FHNNFWHJCUUMRYI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMX/5NWY/JCUUMRYE/FMX5NWYJCUUMRYE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE9/D6L2/JCUUMRYF/FE9D6L2JCUUMRYF.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Data Crunching"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Testing The best code remains theory until it is tested. As the testing took the main part of the design, at least I would like to share some experiences.As explained earlier the Serial.print() stuff is pretty fast even for large amount of data. So during development I really recommend using the serial functions to print as many information to your computer as relevant. Here my recommendation is: Start with the raw data! If things are not running smoothly, try to get an impression what you code is dealing with. If you look at the filtered data, you might miss significant information. Her you might find glitches, drifting of signals or repeating pattern of deviations. The first step then would be looking at numbers, the second step would be looking at curves (created via spreadsheet programs like Excel or Libre Office). To get there, print the values of interest separated by \u201c \u201c (space) and separate the cycles with a new line (e. g. by using a Serial.prinln(\u201c\u201d)).When going into filtering, these values can be analyzed by numbers as well, probably using additionally a LED as indication.When working with analog signals an oscilloscope will come in handy. This is especially the case when the results are unexplainable. These results can be glitches of especially high or low values, repeating pattern of deviation. Single channel oscilloscopes can do a good job, my favorite approach is to use a two channel oscilloscope and use an additional pin for triggering the refresh.Reasons for misreadingsduring many hours of testing I came across different problems resulting in a malfunctioning of the detector.Although the ATmega  chip incorporates some basic pin protection it reacts funny when challenged. Over and under voltage voltage will lead to hick-ups in the code (stalling for a short period of time), a reboot of the chip or in worst case a dead pin. So make sure the pins are well protected. When using diodes to Vcc and GND, keep in mind, that they have a forward voltage of a few millivolts, thus creating small under or over voltages. One other phenomenon is that AD conversion can be disturbed by over or under voltages leading to glitches (values being plain 255 where they should be different or deviating largely in single occasions). Overlaying signals can destabilize readings. So when getting funny readings, try to touch different  components to see if these patterns increase or not (ONLY IF DEALING WITH LOW VOLTAGES!). This might lead to components picking up the noise, needing some shielding or rearranging.Lose wires can generate some noise as well, so do not move components during testingInterfering interrupts will lead to either missed data (value skipped) or to additional delays in the ISR. Being aware of the priority of the interrupt can help, as higher priority ISR will not be interrupted by lower priority interrupts. Accessing the same variables at the same time or changing register values while they are in use will lead to a total halt of the program. So keep an eye on the overall timing of the code when changing  timing of the interrupts dynamically.To find conflicts in timing, use an external pins to indicate when and how long a certain part of the code is running. This of coarse requires an oscilloscope. A different approach is to use the timer1 counter value to be simply printed to the serial monitor. Get the timer1 value at the start of a routine by calling:start=TCNT1; and at the end of the routine:end==TCNT1;by sending the start and end value to the serial monitor, some feeling can be provided for the timing.ConclusionAlthough there are way better micro controllers to use for metal detectors (faster, more precise) the Arduino gives some great approaches. These approaches try to get a maximum of precision and/or speed. There are some basic ways to deal with noisy signals too. But one important thing remains: if the circuit is primitive or poor, the overall results will be too. At the other hand the initially mentioned available circuits (GoldPic, SurfPi, FoxyPi, Teemo DIY, TPIMD, FelezJoo and the TechKiwiGadgets designs here on Instructables) can be used in connection with an Arduino with the above approaches, replacing the intended micro controllers with you own code. As a reference I attached the full code with the implementation of allmost all described features. The required circuit is the LC-Trap circuit with the A0 connected to D6. I will do a separate Instructable to explain the background to the circuit and code in detail.Have fun. P.S.

I have another tutorial with 2 DS18B20 (datalogger).It follows the same concepts of this. Link on the step 6.See you there! Hi, this instructable is for those who want to log data from their sensors but don\u00b4t need a bunch of data.  I want to explain how we can control the sampling  rate with the RTC and then show/save the data. We are going to test, step by step,  the two parts of this shield. I will assume that you are familiar with the Arduino environment at a basic level.I have translated this tutorial  to share it with you, so excuse my english.Feel free to correct me in the comments because this is a fun way to learn. Summary of the steps: I recommend to go step by step, because is easier to find errors than in a large/complex code . If you already have knowledge, you can skip steps.1.-Materials. All you need for this tutorial2.- Adafruit guide (It does not take long). I don\u00b4t want to rewrite the guide because if you are using arduino, you have read a lot of guides, books and tutorials like me. This guide will give you all that you need to know: how to set and test your shield, even if it\u00b4s not your particular shield, as in my case.3.- Testing SD card. We will write data on the sd card with a simple sketch to ensure that it works.4.-Testing the RTC. We will begin to use the RTC to control the sample rate and show data by serial monitor.5.- SD and RTC together. The same excercise  using the entire shield.6.- Sensor data logger.

If there is a large chunk of the budget left over they will know they can build bigger and better. To do an estimate you must first do a quantity takeoff of the certain material you are looking for.

This is often called the p value. In most cases you put significance at the alpha=.05 level, or we require the P value to be less then .05 to be considered statistically significant. Immediately we can see that the terms Sugars, Sugars*CalFat, and CalFat*Protein are not significant at the .05 level.

The code below is a nice example of how  to do this.#include \"Wire.h\"    // imports the wire library for talking over I2C #include \"Adafruit_BMP085.h\"  // import the Pressure Sensor Library AdafruitBMP085 mySensor;  // create sensor object called mySensor  float tempC;  // Variable for holding temp in Cfloat tempF;  // Variable for holding temp in F float pressure; //Variable for holding pressure reading   void setup(){Serial.begin(115200); //turn on serial monitor mySensor.begin();   //initialize mySensor }   void loop() { tempC = mySensor.readTemperature(); //  Read TemperaturetempF = tempC*1.8 + 32.; // Convert degrees C to Fpressure=mySensor.readPressure(); //Read Pressure   Serial.print(\"The Temp is: \"); //Print Your resultsSerial.print(tempF); Serial.println(\" degrees F\"); Serial.print(\"The Barometric Pressure is: \"); Serial.print(pressure); Serial.println(\" Pa.\"); Serial.println(\"\");delay(250); //Pause between readings. }Now run the program and check your serial monitor and you should see  measurements of temperature and pressure.If everything is working good in serial monitor. now slight change in code in print for python interact. change the last serial.print and serial.println to----------------> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Serial.print(tempF);Serial.print(\" , \"); Serial.println(pressure); delay(250); --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------by doing this the serial monitor shows tempF,pressure Now its time to unleash the power of python.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F9L/DQZT/IEX4LD2J/F9LDQZTIEX4LD2J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9I/UGY6/IEX4LF4A/F9IUGY6IEX4LF4A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW0/MJJT/IEX4LFPE/FW0MJJTIEX4LFPE.LARGE.jpg", "/assets/img/pixel.png"], "step_title": "Step 3: BMP180 Sensor Measuring Pressure and Temperature"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Do not simply cut and paste this code, but make sure that you understand  it so you are able to create your own live graphing programs from  scratch.#step 1: import the Libraryimport serial # import Serial Libraryimport numpy  # Import numpyimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt #import matplotlib library from drawnow import *#step2: Setup the variables and create serial object tempF= []pressure=[] arduinoData = serial.Serial('com11', 115200) #Creating our serial object named arduinoDataplt.ion() #Tell matplotlib you want interactive mode to plot live datacnt=0note:- always check the com port. for my case i connect the arduino in com11. your is deffer from me. and baud rate use same baud rate in arduino sketch and python otherwise python fail to interact with arduino.  #step3:create a function for plot:-def makeFig(): #Create a function that makes our desired plot    plt.ylim(80,90) #Set y min and max values         plt.title('My Live Streaming Sensor Data')  #Plot the title        plt.grid(True)  #Turn the grid on         plt.ylabel('Temp F')  #Set ylabels        plt.plot(tempF, 'ro-', label='Degrees F') #plot the temperature         plt.legend(loc='upper left')  #plot the legend         plt2=plt.twinx()  #Create a second y axis        plt.ylim(93450,93525)  #Set limits of second y axis- adjust to readings you are getting         plt2.plot(pressure, 'b^-', label='Pressure (Pa)') #plot pressure data         plt2.set_ylabel('Pressrue (Pa)')  #label second y axis        plt2.ticklabel_format(useOffset=False)  #Force matplotlib to NOT autoscale y axis        plt2.legend(loc='upper right')  #plot the legendstep4:loops that forever :-while True: # While loop that loops forever    while (arduinoData.inWaiting()==0): #Wait here until there is data                 pass #do nothing         arduinoString = arduinoData.readline() #read the line of text from the serial port         dataArray = arduinoString.split(',')   #Split it into an array called dataArray        temp = float( dataArray[0])            #Convert first element to floating number and put in temp         P =    float( dataArray[1])            #Convert second element to floating number and put in P     tempF.append(temp)                     #Build our tempF array by appending temp readings     pressure.append(P)                     #Building our pressure array by appending P readings     drawnow(makeFig)                       #Call drawnow to update our live graph         plt.pause(.000001)                     #Pause Briefly.

Since all these devices run from 5V, this set up is suitable for field and lab work. These instructions are also available here.First let's define what we mean by High Speed Data Logging. For this tutorial, it means a sustained data rate of up to ~40K bytes/sec. That is, being able to sample at ~2000 samples/sec and send the time stamped measurement to a remote Android running pfodApp for logging and plotting with each measurement being approximately 20 bytes (depending on the number of bytes in the time stamp and sample data). While higher burst sampling rates are possible by relying on the internal and network buffers, this page only considers sustained real time sampling rates.First we will discuss the bottlenecks that restrict the data rate and presents a series of simple test programs to help you quantify them. When using pfodApp to log and plot the data, you can turn on the debug logging to record the rate at which the app is processing the data. That rate varies between mobiles and Android versions and also varies depending of what other apps are running.The tests here show that using an Adafruit WICED Feather sending data via a GL AR150 mini router to a ASUS zenfone5,running pfodApp (V2.0.224+), you can log an plot at ~40Kb/sec. On a Nexus P6 you can log and plot at ~48K bytes/sec.

It uses analogRead() but you should replace the line of code with what ever code you need to get the sample. You should also add any extra code you need to scale/normalize the reading and prepare the measurement time stamp. (If you find the scaling calculations are taking too long, try removing all floating point calculations and send the data as integers.)

So a 115200 baud Serial connection can transfer about 115200/10 = 11520 bytes/sec. If there are 14 bytes in each data record (as there are in these tests), that implies to transmit one data record at 115200baud takes ~1.2mS or ~1215mS for 1000 records.

For computers generally only Bluetooth (Classic) and WiFi/Ethernet (TCP/IP) are available.Since we are considering high speed data logging, only TCP/IP will be considered. As noted above, the Arduino Ethernet V1 shields are slow and so Ethernet will not be considered further here. (Arduino Ethernet Shield V3 has not been tested). This leaves WiFi as the communication channel for high speed data logging.Not all WiFi (TCP/IP) implementations have the same speed. In particular the WiFi built into the ESP8266 can only send one packet at a time and waits for that packet to be ACKed before sending the next one. This severely limits its through put. The ESP32 may be better but the Arduino support is currently (as of 4th December 2015) incomplete. The Adafruit WICED board has a better TCP/IP implementation but even with this board, the default code will send lots of small packets. The sketch, WICED_simpleWifiSpeed.ino, finds the speed using the default code with small packets.Using (unbuffered) Adafruit WICED 1000 loops in:5031mS -> Sample rate:0.20k samples/secExample data record:60091255,0.85Lots a small TCP/IP packets severely limits the through put. Adding buffering to the output, so that the data is held until there is a (almost) full TCP/IP packet and then sending it, gives a much faster through put. The buffered files are in this zip file.Using buffered Adafruit WICED 1000000 loops in:131509mS -> Sample rate:7604.04 samples/secTime left to completion: 0.00 secExample data record:1301195611,1.23The buffering class used here is pfodBufferedClient and is it is zipped up with the revised sketch, WICED_bufferedWifiSpeed.ino, in this zip file. Adafruit WICED has a client.usePacketBuffering(true) method, that also does buffering. Unfortunately it will wait for ever to send a partial buffer if you don't call flush(). The pfodBufferedClient class has a short timeout which sends the packet if nothing has been added in the last 10mS. This timeout is checked on each call to read() available(), peek() or stop() and so is more convenient to use. Adding this buffering to the Arduino Ethernet Shield V1 did not significantly increase its through put.So to summarize so far, of the various boards I have to hand, the Adafruit WICED is the fastest. Over a 20min test it sent about about ~120K bytes/sec to TeraTerm running on my computer. If you have a computer handy on the WiFi network then you can use TeraTerm or CoolTerm to capture the data to a file. On the other hand if you are using pfodApp to control the board and capture and chart the samples, the data rate also depends on the processing speed of your Android device and its TCP/IP buffers.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 4: 3. Speed of the Communication Channel"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "The final bottleneck in high speed data logging is the receiving device, be it a computer or a mobile. The previous section tested the speed connecting to a computer. For testing connecting to an Android mobile, pfodApp will be used. For 'remote' data logging a small portable wifi router is used, GL AR150.To test the Android mobile's speed, the free pfodDesignerV2 app was used to design a simple menu with just one button which opens a single plot of the sampled analog data. Adafruit WICED and pfodDesignerV2 covers designing a menu for WICED and Adding a Chart and Logging Data on How to Display/Plot Arduino Data on Android has details on setting up a chart with one plot and logging data.The resulting sketch generated by pfodDesignerV2 for the WICED target is WICED_chart.ino and produces the following menu and chart. Data samples are only sent at 1/sec.The WICED_chart.ino sketch was then modified to add buffering and to send the data at a much faster rate. The files use for the following tests are in pfodWICED_highSpeedChart.zip Unzip those to your Arduino directory and compile and load the WICED board with the pfodWICED_highSpeedChart sketch.Install pfodApp and set up a connection to your WICED board as described in pfodAppForAndroidGettingStarted.pdf. To see in more detail what is happening, in pfodApp open Add/Edit for the WICED connection and tick the Log Debug data tick box. This will log to the WICED_debug.txt file under /pfodAppDebugData directory on your mobile. By default, Log Plot Data is ticked and pfodApp saves any data received to a file on your Android device under the /pfodAppRawData directory.After you exit pfodApp (which flushes the last buffer), transfer the /pfodAppDebugData/WICED_debug.txt file to you computer (using say the wifi file transfer app) and open it in a text editor. You will find lines like< 1481329581822 4.962sec dataRate:42Kbytes/sec { }\u2026..137033.63,1145.00,,> 1481329581860 0.038sec dataRate:42Kbytes/sec {}137034.66,1156.00,,In this instance pfodApp was running on an ASUS zenfone5 mobile, running Android 4.4.2. The dataRate: is the Kbytes/sec since the last pfod message. The data rate varies between mobiles and Android versions and also varies depending of what other apps are running.The < \u2026 { } is a keep alive message sent very 5sec if no other pfod commands are being sent by the user. The > \u2026 {} is the response back from the WICED board 0.038sec later. If the data rate is too high for the Android mobile to handle then the 0.038sec will progressively get longer and longer and eventually exceed the connection timeout (default 10sec) and cause the pfodApp to disconnect and reconnect.The pfodApp chart is updated about once per sec. You can freeze the plot by putting your finger on the chart. You can also use two fingers to zoom the chart and drag the chart.Reducing the PLOT_DATA_INTERVAL to 500uS unsigned long PLOT_DATA_INTERVAL = 500;// uS == 0.5mS == 2kHz samples , edit this to change the plot data intervaldoubles the sample rate so that the data rate is about 40Kbytes/sec.The ASUS zenphone5 running Android 4.4.2 has a processing dataRate is about 40Kb/sec, if the WICED's data rate exceeds that, pfodApp cannot keep up and quickly times out. You can set the pfodApp connection time out to 0 so it never times out, but eventually the WiFi TCP buffers will fill up and block the data being sent.When running pfodApp on a Nexus P6 you can reduce the PLOT_DATA_INTERVAL to 400uS unsigned long PLOT_DATA_INTERVAL = 400;// uS == 0.4mS == 2.5kHz samples , edit this to change the plot data intervalwhich give a data rate of about 48Kb/sec.ConclusionThere are a number of factors that limit the data rate for an Arduino/Android based system. Of the boards I have here, the Adafruit WICED connected via WiFi to a ASUS zenfone5 or Nexus P6 running pfodApp (V2.0.224+), was the fastest, achieving ~40Kb/sec (~2000 samples/sec.) The pfodApp can also plot the data and you can freeze the plot by putting you finger on it. Using a 5V mini router, like the GL AR150, allows you to take the whole set up out in the field.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FRL/DHT6/IWH3AH3Z/FRLDHT6IWH3AH3Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F75/NN9E/IWH3AH40/F75NN9EIWH3AH40.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAP/6US9/IWH3AH41/FAP6US9IWH3AH41.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMX/9ECS/IWH3AH4F/FMX9ECSIWH3AH4F.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: 4.

There are also micros that can be used with external memory (adds complexity and expense), UV erasable micros (usually quite expensive due to the special packaging), one-time programmable chips (potentially usable after you have a working design, but losing their price advantage anyway), and mask-programmed chips (essentially useless.) \nPeripherals: \nIf you want your microcontroller to have built in Ethernet, CAN, USB, or even multiple serial ports, many common choices are going to be eliminated.  Some peripherals can be handy to have: UARTs, SPI or I2C controllers, PWM controllers, and EEPROM data memory are good examples, even though similar functionality can frequently be implemnented in software or external parts. \nIt's convenient if output pins can supply reasonable amounts of current for driving LEDs or transistors directly; some chips have 5mA or less drive capability. \nPhysical packaging: \nHobbyists are somewhat limited is the packages they are able to deal with, from a prototyping, PCB fabrication, and/or soldering.  That 256 ball BGA coldfire CPU may be sweet, but it's effectively unusable by mere mortals.  Microcontrollers available in 0.1in DIP packages are much easier to deal with.  Probably anything with a pin spacing smaller than 0.05in should be viewed with some skepticism. \nMemory: \nThe size of memory may be an important consideration.  Some micros have as few as 256 innstructions and 16 bytes of RAM.  You can do a lot in that sort of space (believe it or not), but not everything.  Moreover, while you can frequently upgrade to a \"bigger chip\", some chip families have relatively small memory limits imposed by their architecture, so even the biggest chip you can get will have only 8k instructions (for example.)  RAM (data memory) is usually scarce in microcontrollers; some algorithms require substantial RAM to be implemented in a straightforward manner, and it may be worthwhile looking for a micro with a lot of RAM (or external RAM expansion capabilities) if that's the sort of thing you had in mind.  (For instance, implementing TCP/IP networking protocols in a micro whose total RAM space is less than used by a typical ethernet packet is likely to be ... interesting.)

It includes details like how many \"registers\" there are, and how \"general purpose\" those registers are, whether code can execute out of data memory, whether the peripherals are treated like memory, registers, or yet something else, whether there is a stack and how it works, and so on.\nYou will hear people talk about how some architectures are better than others.  I suppose this is true.  But I'm going to claim that it is largely irrelevant for the typical hobbyist.  If you wish to avoid the architectural quirks of a particular family of microcontrollers, you can use a high level language.  If you're willing to program in assembler, you're at a level of interest where learning and overcoming the quirks is party of the stuff you should be learning.  Besides, we're not talking here about evaluating some new architecture that some company is proposing.  All of the chips I mention in this instructable have been around long enough that they've proven that their architectures are good enough for MANY real applications.\nHere are some architectural \"features\" you may read about and some explanation of what they mean.\nCISC/RISC.  Complex Instruction Set Computer.   Reduced Instruction Set Computer.\nIn the old days, CPU designers were getting clever and wanted their CPUs to support high-level language features in hardware, leading to cobol-like string manipulation instructions  that accepted arguments in blocks of 8 registers.  IIRC, it was Berkeley and IBM who noticed that compiler writers didn't really know how to USE such complicated instructions from a compiler, the amount of silicon real estate used by these instructions was getting large, and in fact the hardware implementation sometimes wasn't as fast as doing the same thing in software anyway.  So they said \"I bet we can make the CPU go a lot faster if we leave out these complex instructions and dedicate the silicon to more registers or cache memory or something\", and thereby invented the RISC CPU.  Nowadays \"RISC\" is widely used by marketing departments to mean \"we don't have very many instructions\", even if the rest of the architecture isn't very much like the original RISC researchers had envisioned.\nHarvard Architecture.\nIn a Harvard architecture, the instruction memory and the data memory are separate, controlled by different buses, and sometimes have different sizes.  For microcontrollers, the instructions are usually stored in \"read only\" memory, and data is in RAM or registers.  An example is the\nPIC microcontroller, where instructions are in 12, 14, or 16 bit wide flash, and data is  in 8bit\nwide RAM.\nVon Neuman Architecture.\nIn a von Neuman Architecture, data and instructions share memory space, so you could do things like dynamic compilation to generate instructions in RAM and then execute them.  The TI MSP430 is an example of a von Neuman architecture.\nAccumulator based\nIn an \"accumulator based\" architecture, there is usually one \"special\" register where most of the actual computation (math, logic, etc) occurs.  Some effort has to be spent to get operands into the accumulator and results back out to where you need them.  The opposite is a processor with \"general purpose\" registers, where any of several registers can be used for math/etc.\nLoad/Store\nA load/store architecture typically means that operands to ALU operations have to be in registers, so that you have to load them from memory beforehand and store them back when operations are complete.  The opposite typically allows operations between a register or\naccumulator and a memory location directly.  RISC architectures tend to be load/store, since a lot or the CISCness of CISC processors shows up in implementing complex \"addressing modes\" for accessing the memory operands.  In a RISC architecture, all that complexity only has to be implemented in the load and store instructions (if at all.)\nRegisters\nMemory Mapped I/O", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FG0/NEFT/NCTEWIJLRFA/FG0NEFTNCTEWIJLRFA.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Thoughts About Architectures"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Minimally, you'll need some sort of programmer to load the program into the microcontroller. \nThese vary wildly in cost.

If you have a palmtop, it probably contains an ARM-based chip.

Both have flash memory and some interesting peripherals , and inexpensive \"evaluation boards\" that include a C compiler.  At one time, the zilog evaluation boards were quite \"full\" compared to many low cost evaluation boards, but the current versions seem less so.  (My EZ8kit has 4 5x7 matrix displays, an IRDA transceiver, two rs232 async ports, an rs485 port, and assorted buttons and lights.  IIRC, it was $50 (special deal at a trade show.))Fritzk9 said in comments:\nMost of the people who have commented list the PIC, PICAxe, ARM, 8052, or Basic Stamps. These are all popular chips, but if you are just getting started with microcontrollers, you might want to start with something fairly cheap. How does $40 sound?\nThat's what the Zilog Z8 Encore! 8-bit microcontroller development kit costs. The Z8 Encore! microcontrollers are available with 1K to 64K of flash RAM. For speed, they operate at 5- to 20-MHz, and depending on the chip, they are available in various packages from 8 to 80 pins. The $39.95 development kit contains a development board with input/output pins, a wall wart power supply, computer cable (USB or serial to connect your computer to the development board), and a free C compiler and assembler that runs under Windows. You don't need to buy or build a programmer, since you can program the chip right in the circuit you've built -- without having to remove it and reprogram it in a programmer.\nAll the Encore! chips can communicate serially through a UART (some have 2 UARTs). Some have analog-to-digital converters built-in, and some have an infra-red (IRDA) communications port. Oh, and there are up to 4 built-in timers on the chip, depending on the chip version. The price of an Encore! microcontroller is pretty reasonable, given all the capabilities (anywhere from $3 to $13 each from Digi-Key).\nThe C compiler is excellent. The Zilog C compiler has most of the capabilities of \"big boy\" compilers, like a floating point library, trig functions, etc. It produces better assembly code than I can, so I use it almost exclusively.\nRemember that almost any non-trivial code you write will have bugs. The debugger supplied with the development kit permits you to step through your code and look at the results of variables stored in the various registers to help you locate your mistakes.\nDigi-Key stocks two different Encore! development kits (either one costs $39.95); one for 8K/4K chips, and the other for 16K through 64K chips. The Digi-Key part number for the 8K/4K development kit is 269-3183-ND, and the part number for the 64K development kit is 2693249-ND. http://www.digikey.comZilog's website has a large number of sample applications, full documentation of their microcontrollers, and free updates to the C compiler supplied with the development kit.\nI'd say that the only downside is that the Z8 Encore! isn't as popular as the PIC as a hobbyist chip, so there haven't been any books or many of projects published for it except for some articles in Circuit Cellar magazine.

The web has done away with the need for most of that, and many vendors seem to have taken the money they saved on postage and used it to make their sample program more accessible.The way \"free samples\" work is that the manufacturer will happily send you several samples of a part, in the hopes that you'll try them out and be so impressed that you'll used them in a project that nets them sales of millions of units.  Or (if you're a student) that they'll win some loyalty and \"mindshare\" when you get out into the real world and be more likely to use their microcontrollers than someone else's.  Or that you'll write some magazine or web article that will call attention to their products.  It's a marketing expense, and it's probably cheaper than many marketing expenses...Microchip, Freescale, and TI all have very liberal sample policies.  Look up a part on their website, and it's likely to have a \"sample\" button somewhere on the page; send them some info and in a week or so you're likely to have chips in hand.  Other vendors are harder; you may have to talk to a representative.  Vendors have a weak spot (as they should) for students; you might think that a sample request from a \"my-u.edu\" email address carries less weight than one from \"nonexistantcompany.com\", but that's not necessarilly true.Ethics of Free SamplingI suppose there are ethics to requesting free samples.  Here are some of my personal rules:1) NEVER resell samples.  I see lots of eBay listings for chips in quantities that match the max sample quantities of some vendors.  It pisses me off.  (Of course, this COULD be another \"sample channel\" officially endorsed by the vendor.  But it doesn't look that way.)2) Don't lie more than necessary.  I think making up a company name is fine, but inventing 10000 fellow employees and a product that will sell 10k/year of a chip is over the line.  (This has been especially interesting as I've transitions from student to engineer at unknown company to engineer at extemely well-known company.  These days If I ask for a sample, I'm likely to get a phone call from an enthusiastic salesperson hoping for a win in our next big product, and I usually explain that no, the best they can hope for from me is to get inserted into some odd piece of custom lab gear.)3) Don't be greedy.  Some vendors limit you to so many samples per month, or per order.  That doesn't mean you should submit new sample orders every month, or order the maximum number of samples allowed.  (OTOH, be aware that for many of the chips we're talking about, the order processing and shipping costs more than the chips themselves...)4) Spread Good Publicity.   If you pubish a project that used a sample, be sure to say nice things about their product.  If you can't find something nice to say about a chip you sampled, you probably shouldn't say anything at all.

It might work better if you write the program on a PC in assembler, then send it to the calculator, but you need a special link cable, and that kind of defeats the point of this instructable.Update:\nThe above code is claimed to work on both TI-83 and Ti-84 models.\nThanks LightShadow756 for sending me the following code for theTi-89:\n(Program)\ncamera(pics,delay)\nPrgm\n0->x\nWhile x < pics\nFor y,0,delay,1\nEndFor\nTry\nx+1->x\nSendChat a\nElse\nClrErr\nEndTry\nEndWhile\nEndPrgm\n(End Program)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSB/UN7Y/FB11KXRF/FSBUN7YFB11KXRF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL6/B10V/FB11TXZC/FL6B10VFB11TXZC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F63/5WHM/FB11TXZF/F635WHMFB11TXZF.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Program the Calculator"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "This step should be pretty easy depending on what kind of camera you have. Most TI calculators have a 2.5mm audio jack used for linking two calculators together. It turns out my EOS rebel uses the same type of jack, and there is no conversion required.\rHowever, if your camera uses a different size audio cable, you might need to use a adapter. Even worse, if it uses a different shape connector, you might have to buy or make an adapter (I know cameras like the canon 10D have shutter release plugs that are specially made for them, it's very hard to find these types of connectors).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8H/KII2/FB11KXT8/F8HKII2FB11KXT8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEH/IROP/FB11KXTC/FEHIROPFB11KXTC.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Making the Connection!"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "This is where the fun starts. Don't plug in your calculator yet.First, decide what you want to photograph. If outdoors, try to do this at a time where lighting conditions remain fairly constant. Also, try to shoot away from the sun.Set up your shot - Use a sturdy tripod and don't zoom in too tight. Don't forget that things can change over a long period of time.Focus - After focusing, switch your camera to manual focus, or use a lock focus feature if your camera has one. This step is very important because your camera might decide to focus on something else in the picture if your subject moves. It won't look very good if the focus is rapidly changing in a video. Also, if you're photographing the sky and there are no clouds in the frame, the camera won't be able to focus on anything at it might not take a picture at all.Set the exposure - This step might be even more crucial than the focus step. If your camera has a manual exposure mode, or a lock exposure mode, it is very important that you use it. Like with the focus, exposure can change over time and it doesn't look good at all when your video is getting brighter and darker very quickly.Set Quality - Depending on your camera and how much resolution you want, you will need to adjust your picture quality. My canon rebel can take pictures up to 6.3 megapixels, but this is very unnecessary if I'm going to make a small video to put on youtube.Also, depending on your computer, it will take a LONG time to open up 200+ photos taken in the highest quality.So, I usually turn my quality down to the lowest setting.Some optional stepsTurning picture review off - If you want to save battery life by not having the LCD turn on every time you take a picture, remember to turn the image review off.Turn camera sleep off - If you're going to be taking pictures with very large delays in between, you'll need to turn your camera sleep mode off. (This will drain battery faster though. If you're really worried about this you can actually modify the program to \"wake up\" the calculator before attempting to take a shot, this way you can keep the calculator in sleep mode. However, I think this is unnecessary).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJA/PCN6/FB11KXVK/FJAPCN6FB11KXVK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDX/UPRG/FB11KXVW/FDXUPRGFB11KXVW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4D/ETE9/FB11KXW0/F4DETE9FB11KXW0.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Set Up Your Shot."}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "This part is fairly easy:Connect your Camera and Calculator - Use the link cable from part 3 to connect the twoStart the program - Turn on your calculator and press the PRGM button.

Note: this is not the amount of time in seconds. I think about 100 of these make a second, but this can change depending on battery life and your calculator model. If you don't want to think about this conversion every time, you can add a small piece of code in the program to do it for you.Press Enter - Your camera should start snapping away! Now sit back and relax and make sure nothing explodes.Turn the Program off - When you're done shooting, you can turn the program off by pressing or holding the ON button.

There are many ways you can do this.Youtube has a guide to compiling a video using Windows Movie Maker here. What I don't like about this though is that you can't easily change the framerate of your video, so the final product will look slow and choppy.Personally, I like to use QuickTime Pro from Apple (as much as I don't like Apple...)First, copy all of you photos onto your computer hard drive and put them into a folder.You will probably want to resize all of your photos beforehand. This will prevent your computer from freezing up if it tries to open up too many large photos with quicktime. I suggest using Windows XP PowerToys image resizer which you can download directly here. It's very easy to use and you can resize all your photos in a snap.Next (if you're using Quicktime Pro), go to file > Open Image Sequence. Select the first image from your video, and press Okay. Your video should be automatically created!Then, select File > Export. This is where you might have to play with the settings. If you want to upload your video to YouTube, I suggest looking at this page.If you want your video to be streamlined for Youtube, select \"Movie to MPEG-4\" in the export dialog, then click the Options button to change more options around. I've included a picture with some settings, but I'm not very good with video stuff, so please experiment to find what suits your needs.If you want a higher quality video, I'd suggest AVI or a Quicktime Movie format, but once again I'm not very good with this so please experiment.If you don't want to \"buy\" Quicktime Pro though, there are many other options. It's really beyond the scope of this instructable though, so I'll leave that up to you. A quick google search for \"Stop Motion software\" should yield plenty of results.I won't go much more into this as it will vary greatly depending on your setup.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FD8/SU79/FB11TXZT/FD8SU79FB11TXZT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLZ/TT9D/FB11TXZZ/FLZTT9DFB11TXZZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8J/CGLS/FB11TY01/F8JCGLSFB11TY01.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZY/8E3O/FB11TY0D/FZY8E3OFB11TY0D.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Compile the Video!"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "\n          Here are a couple finished videos I've made using this method.It would also be nice if anyone who knows how to program later model calculators (Ti-84, 86, and 89) could write some programs to do the same thing.
